0,isfp,"I'm pretty damn goofy but I never think of it as me disrespecting whoever has to witness/interact with me. I have to be careful not to rub people the wrong way lest I accidentally offend someone. It's a constant struggle, I feel like a kid at the grownup table. Or I could just not give a crap which is more fun, aw man I miss having fun"
1,isfp,I feel it physically..like my body gets more tense and stiff and I'm nodding my head agreeing with this person while in my head I'm hyper aware of how much I want to get out of there but on the other hand I also want to be social and have friends. 
2,isfp,"I hate to bother people, so I'm always a little worried I might be boring someone when talking about myself or prying or intruding when asking the other person questions. Two fundamentals of a decent conversation."
3,isfp,"I suck at it too ... depending on which person I'm ""small-talking"" with. Some types are really good at keeping the discussion afloat, no matter how awkward one is at the beginning. I'm mostly referring to ESFP, and ESFJ. If you're not good at small-talk, I would recommend you to approach those types to watch and learn. They really know how to bring people out of their shell.  "
4,isfp,"When you get to know someone, let them know early that you aren't good with small talk. It's a good explanation of your quietness and it's completely normal to not be good at small talk, it isn't just us."
5,isfp,"How people react to stress is different for everyone, I know some isfps that can handle stress pretty well, and I know some that do not handle it well at all. Me personally, when I get stressed I tend to shut down and want to avoid everything. Something to help someone in my case would be to provide assistance if possible and be very open, kind, and understanding of the situation that caused the stress to come on in the first place. Keeping the peace is definitely a key thing to remember. "
6,isfp,When I‚Äôm during stress I feel like I start loosing it. I become very anxious and I have to work really hard to try to contain all of the stress and and anxiety and even then I feel like people know I‚Äôm going through a rough time. Usually some time alone to gather my thoughts and come up with some sort of strategy to solve the problem puts me more at ease and gives me hope to do what I have to do
7,isfp,"It depends on the setting. The best way I can describe myself being stressed out is through analogy. At work, I‚Äôm like the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Quiet, focused, intense, and bordering on cold toward everyone I‚Äôm around; my logical side also does tend to surface at work where I start planning out my next task while completing a different task. At home, I‚Äôm more like a river: my emotions flow a little better as I don‚Äôt feel the need to dam up my emotions in front of people. My logical side doesn‚Äôt really surface as much at home for whatever reason I can‚Äôt seem to figure out myself.
I‚Äôm probably not speaking for all ISFPs, but I usually just handle my stress and my problems by myself; however, it does become more manageable knowing I have someone who can help me if I get overwhelmed. If you have an ISFP coworker/friend that‚Äôs stressed out, just let them know you‚Äôre there for them if they need help. Believe me, it‚Äôs incredibly comforting knowing somebody has my back. "
8,isfp,"Not that long probably less than an hour, I usually go into my bathroom where I have big mirrors and I just speak my thoughts out loud. I know it sounds weird but locking yourself in a room by yourself, speaking your thoughts out loud and seeing myself in the mirror helps me reconnect with myself and I can sort out my thoughts and come up with a game plan (so basically just alone time to reflect)"
9,isfp,"It‚Äôs more of a subconscious change that depends on who I‚Äôm surrounded by and the location; I prefer not getting emotional at work because I don‚Äôt want to make my coworkers uncomfortable and it‚Äôs also a professional environment where emotional outbursts would get me in trouble. Home is a comfortable environment, so I‚Äôm more prone to be emotional when I get stressed."
10,isfp,"That‚Äôs an unfair assumption. I took so much time to understand the ISFP who I was seeing. I have posted about him here because I wanted to try and see things from his perspective to try and figure what was going on in his head because I thought he was going through something (he is, but refused my help and that‚Äôs okay). 
I‚Äôm not saying that this is all ISFPs but some are definitely easy to scare and flighty. When people care about another person, they put effort in to make it work. The reason why I have seen everyone else post is because they care but don‚Äôt want to put pressure the ISFP they want to be with. That‚Äôs the opposite of not taking the time. Don‚Äôt confuse the two. "
11,isfp,"Anyone else get randomly obsessed with things or ideas?!
I‚Äôm impulsively looking at buying a new car, and I‚Äôve been spending every waking moment that I‚Äôm not working or parenting for days researching it non-stop. I stayed up until 4 am this morning üòÇ
Came home early from a work to nap and I can‚Äôt nap! 
I dislike these random obsessions, they exhaust me. 
going to meditate now"
12,isfp,"Wooooow I'm the same way! I get serious tunnel vision. I get these obsessions and then forget about them after a few days. Like I'll spend two hours shopping for the specific nail polish colors I like, add them to the cart, decide to wait a little to buy them until I have the spare cash, and them forget about it. Such is life lol "
13,isfp,"Yes, I'm also nosy as hell... so sometimes I'm up late spying on people online or researching really random shit about places or looking at buying houses in random places.  I really get going on tangents a lot. "
14,isfp,"definetly. for some reason i got obsessed with skateboarding a few months ago. now i skate every freking day. i also have this with bands and music styles... my tastes are always some kind of phase that lasts for a few weeks and then i just add a bit of it to my life after the real obsession is gone. thats the reason i have ska, 90s techno and surf rock in the same spotify playlist. lol"
15,isfp,"Yes! Little projects, big purchases, anticipated conversations, better ways to get places on my bike. It doesn't happen all the time, but I'd say once a month or so I lose most of a night of sleep thinking obsessively about something. "
16,isfp,"Yes! I seem to have this often! I‚Äôll get really obsessed with something and immerse myself in it. It really could be anything, from knitting, to a movie like Into The Wild, to a band, even to a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù like the feeling of Christmas. It never lasts long either, until it‚Äôs on to the next obsession. My family and close friends sort of just know this about me and see it as a unique little quirk lol"
17,isfp,"Hello friends! Us isfp's are well known for our carefree attitudes and adventurous tendencies and we hate to be ""shoved into a box,"" including the box that is the isfp personality sometimes. I am unique and although I do relate to the standard isfp model there are things about me that you wouldn't quite expect.


I love the color grey. As the most artistic personally, grey would seem to be the least likely to be favored because it has no personality. I just love it though because it sort of represents my philosophy on life that nothing is black and white. You have to look at controversial issues from multiple perspectives to get the full picture and it ends up being somewhat of a grey area. Also it's just astheticly  pleasing bc it brings out the vibrancy all the other colors. 


I learn best with concepts, not applications. Generally, personalities with the S trait only want to learn unless there is a practical application to it. For me, learning the application before the concept can be really confusing bc in the real world there's always exceptions but learning a theoretical model can make things much more simple and easy to understand. Once the concept is understood, the application to that concept can flow right in. I know I'm iSfp and not iNfp because I'm naturally a perfectionist and I tend to be better at pointing out differences in minute details than others. 


I SUCK at creating my own artistic works but I'm great and taking what others create and adding my own personality to them. For some reason if I have a blank mind, it will stay blank. But if I'm inspired somehow by someone else's creativity I get so full of ideas.


So that's me, but what kind of uniqueness do you bring to the isfp table? Maybe an uncommon hobby or habit that you wouldn't think a standard isfp would do. I know it can be hard to open up but I think it's fun to get some perspective into the lives of others. Also, I'm thinking about trying to regularly post here to get some insight on how people like me live and maybe make some knew like-minded friends allong the way :) C√≠ao! "
18,isfp,"I'm very lazy and inactive and only really go outside if it's necessary, I'm way more active on the Internet. I also discuss theories and concepts a lot, even more than my intuitive friends, as long as I'm interested in those. I also don't mind shallow stuff in music or any medium, as long as it's aesthetically appealing and/or fun. I'm also quite easily stressed when things don't go the way I planned, except if it changes in a positive way. Finally, I'm extremely conservative with food and will rarely if ever try new food, I have a very small amount of food I like. I'm really the opposite with music and stuff, so idk."
19,isfp,"
Except when it comes to controlling desires, I am not impulsive at all. I spend weeks considering anything I buy, try (usually fail) to plan exactly what I‚Äôm going to say when approaching someone new, and I usually won‚Äôt get together with friends unless they‚Äôre the one to suggest it.

2 I‚Äôm very interested in and good at science. I definitely prefer art (specifically photography, film, and music), but I LOVE physics as well, and ecology, and computer science. And math is always a highest mark for me, I rarely get below a 97-98 on it, whereas with artistic classes I tend to do badly, though that might be because I‚Äôm too much of a perfectionist to get all the work done. Which does fall into the ISFP stereotype pretty well. :P

I like philosophy and abstract stuff. I actually made an abstract film for a final project once. But anyway, I‚Äôve had conversations about philosophy that lasted hours. The key is I have to have a reason to care, I don‚Äôt debate about metaphysics for example, because I just don‚Äôt see how it impacts me. 
"
20,isfp,"Supposedly we are spontaneous? I'm not sure to what degree, but I hate random chaos, especially not of my own doingÔΩûand no one's ever called me spontaneous or disorganized (although I am messy). That's what threw me off for so long. But a little of that comes from fam issues as opposed to personality. "
21,isfp,"Not very Artistic or creative. I have a slight interest in art, but not much. I absolutely love music though. 
Also, not sure if this breaks anything, but my favorite color is actually a tie between red and black. I can't decide which of those colors i personally like more."
22,isfp,"Woah I love science too! And I've always been really good at math. I think it's interesting because when people do higher level mathematics, the same areas of the brain light up as when playing or listening to music! "
23,isfp,I used to love philosophy! And yeah I'm not impulsive at all. I take so much time to plan and make sure but that moreso comes from having very impulsive family members and seeing how badly that goes XD 
24,isfp,I used to be a lot more spontaneous a few years ago because I didn't really have a lot of responsibility. Now I'm in school full time and have a full time job and a significant other so my spontaneity has gone down significantly. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to be successful at any of those because I'd be off on a road trip to West Virginia to try the only Mac Donald's with pizza (actually did that once)
25,isfp,"I like red and black together actually. Colors by themselves are boring but contrast them against each other and they look fabulous!
Also music is very much still an art and it takes just as much creativity to make music as it does to draw or paint :)"
26,isfp,"I am reading a book called The Power of Now. I‚Äôm still early in but I think it‚Äôs a book I needed. 
When I was younger, I wanted to be an ISFP. I was okay with my feelings. I liked my artistic self. 
What I couldn‚Äôt stand was the constant chain of thoughts in my head. I had to put on music to drown out the thoughts to sleep.
What I feared was the constant barrage of painful memories that kept dragging me back to the past.
Lost in the thoughts and memories, I let the present moment pass me by like a stream of water.
I envied ISFPs because you looked calm and level-headed all the while keeping your values and feelings.
I may not become an ISFP, but I can surely become a mindful INFP. 
I am on my journey to the here and now.
It‚Äôs just some random thoughts I wanted to share before I go to sleep."
27,isfp,"You gotta be careful with your thoughts as if you‚Äôre unhappy, it can get toxic very quickly. That‚Äôs the time when I need to drown them out with activity of music. It can be hard and hard on the people around you if you get angry. "
28,isfp,"I've found that when it comes to painful memories, mindfulness is just a part of the equation. The other part is relentless compassion for the wounded child you were (and that still exists within you).
One thing I noticed when doing mindfulness was that it was very difficult to be mindful of the body, so I would mostly just be mindful of sights, sounds etc. But being mindful of the body (muscle tensions, breathing etc.) is really the most important thing for staying grounded."
29,isfp,"And This is basically just going to be a ramble to see if anything hits.
¬†
I'll get the lay of the land, seeing as it doesn't seem that active and why not? You don't know me. At worst I'll get into another accidental Reddit argument. (How that even happened idk but it seemed rude to stop?)
¬†
Don't know too much about (MBTI) except I type into ISFP every few years and I'd guess my boyfriend is a INTJ. Which is strange because to me everyone that can be around new people must be an extrovert. 
¬†
I missed the ""Find a Friend Thread"" over a wholesome memes and you guys seem to be at a standstill. 
¬†
So here's the deal, Im [insert age and gender here]. I think anything can be funny until it's serious. I don't believe in fighting over politics or religion but I would love to talk about world mythologies! Or video games. (Or both at the same time!). I used to be a web developer but doing it as a job took all enjoyment out of it (also my bf is a big shot and who wants to be compared to that?). I recently took up jewelry making in my free time. I like a variety of music. 
¬†
My boyfriend and I do this cheesy thing where we take a popular song and one up each other in add dirty limericks. I'm biased-ly better.
¬†
Really I don't care what we talk about here. (Honestly you're all asleep but it feels nice to type all this down. I can be the person I want to be as long as I have the opportunity to edit my words.)
¬†
So talk, don't talk. Maybe we can communicate in barks? Im more of a cat person, but I can make it work. There's got to be a primer for that somewhere. 
¬†
Ok, ending this now its getting quite silly."
30,isfp,"Haha, welcome. I don't know what it is about reddit that makes us so uninterested in posting in here. I think we could be more active though. (not using should because that is an annoying word) I've gotten a couple ideas but just haven't gotten around in posting them lol. (I assure you though the ISFP Facebook group is WAY more active.) "
31,isfp,"I'm ISFP(obviously I guess?) and my ex was an INTJ as well. I would love to hear your thoughts on the compatibility there, or really just any comments you have about your relationship. I could definitely go into mine and my ex's relationship, I probably just need some questions to go off of to get into it. "
32,isfp,"The thing is we're childhood friends. He moved in next door when we we're 8 and it was Gameboys and Pokemon from then on. We drifted apart middle school through high school but became friends again while I was dating a ~~douche~~extrovert. Our tastes in music, food, movies, and games tend to overlap enough to give us common interests but with enough of a difference to keep out some personal interests.
We're both introverts, but where I am shy (all the time) he just doesn't feel the need to speak that much. We enjoy staying home and going out about the same. Different weeks need a different kind of recharge. We've been in a relationship for 6 years and we rarely fight and never yell (at each other, at least). We always have each others back in public. I end up backing off before arguments get out of control, at least until tempers cool off. Nothing makes me more uncomfortable than yelling.
¬†
He's quick to judge and keeps a mean grudge, but he's good at making decisions and getting stuff done.  He's charismatic in a way I could only dream of and incredibly brilliant and proud of what he's accomplished.
Neither of us are ready for kids and might not ever be. He 'likes nice things too much' and my attention focuses in a quick bursts before going on to something else. We have a cat I dote and someday we'll get him a corgi. We often rehash old issues just to make sure we're still on the same page. 
¬†
I tend to get my way in the day to day decisions but if he makes a decision it is often a major one. (Like this mornings decision to go back to six flags next week, weather permitting).
¬†
The only real issue right now is that he's quite interested in tying the knot but I am reluctant to 'tie him down'. I feel like a lead weight. Really nothing much will change if we get married, we already live together. Why am I still so insecure?!?
Im wondering if any of these points are familiar to ISFPs? Or if I've got some new stuff to work through."

34,isfp,"Everytime someone says ""i missed you"" i have to lie and say i missed them too so i dont hurt their feelings. I cant ever remember missing some one. I was sad when my grandma died, but i cant say that i miss her. Shes just not around anymore. I never feel like hitting ppl up and seeing how their doing and reconnecting. I dont feel their absence and think longingly of them. I like hanging out with people at times and im happy when im with them but im not sad when im not with them. Even with my boyfriend i dont really miss him when hes not around. I barely feel any loneliness for that matter. I suppose if i were in solitary confinement for months or something it would be a different story but for the most part my own company is enough for me. Is this normal? Am i heartless or what? Im concerned that im missing something important that other people have. Like maybe i dont love right or something. Maybe im too self centered."
35,isfp,"I dwell on potential absence. It's hard for me to cope with knowing loved ones will die one day. Is that a kind of missing?  
As long as they're happy and well (and hopefully flourishing), I'm fine, and I don't need to be around them. But this Mono no aware thing will sneak up on me‚Äîoften when I'm with the person. I suppose a psychologist would chalk it up to anxiety, maybe with elements of ADD.  
Not missing people sounds anomalous to me. I think I could manage an abnormally long amount of time in isolation, but I can still imagine the warmth certain people provide. It's like, I've taught myself not to need the comfort of friendship, but when it does happen, I think, ""ah, i've been missing out on this."" (which becomes, ""I miss this"". ""I miss you"".)  
I hope that makes some sense. It's late, I'm going to bed.  
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think 
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink."
36,isfp,"I can relate in a sense. My sister left for college and I cried the day she left. But now after a few months I rarely think about her and the only time we talk is when she texts or asks to call me. I never initiate anything. It confuses me because I love my sister, but at the same time I don't miss her. I'm very sensitive and emotional overall, maybe I just processed losing her too quickly? Idk."
37,isfp,"My love for people is only apparent once they're gone or I don't see them for a while.  I take people in my life for granted.  I guess I get used to them if I see them every single day.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder. I love my cat, but if I'm away from her for a few days I start to really miss her and my love for her becomes very apparent."
38,isfp,I actually totally feel this way with friends. But I definitely miss my parents though. I honestly feel it has to do with the fact that I just don‚Äôt feel that personally close with even ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends which in itself is kind of sad tbh
39,isfp,"I‚Äôm like that, but only bc I had only a few people I genuinely cared about, and they screwed me over. Since then, whenever someone walks out of my life, it doesn‚Äôt really make much of a difference to me"
40,isfp,My best friend passed away 3 years ago and when she died I was heartbroken and then the day of the funeral I was ok because I cried 2 days beforehand and I went home after the funeral and I was ok üòê still sad but ok . I think of her every now and then but not all the time and I don‚Äôt think of her until around the time she passed which was early October. Only time when I start thinking about her everyday and I start missing her is around early October it‚Äôs so weird it‚Äôs like my subconscious mind knows this is when she passed üòï I‚Äôm missing her right now üòî but if the person is alive no I don‚Äôt miss them unless it‚Äôs my older sister & mother and I haven‚Äôt spoke/seen them in awhile üôÇ
41,isfp,"My best friend is the same way as us. So, you can guess how our relationship is going, lol. Neither of us has sent a text in months. Do I gotta be the one to break the ice? It gets harder the longer it goes on. "
42,isfp,"Male INFJ I've been crazy in love with a female ISFP for nearly 17 years now. God I've held onto her for the longest time yet over that time she has emotionally constrained herself to the point of no communication for nearly three years now. I believed and believed yes I know I'm crazy but when I fell in love with her at the beginning I made a vow in my heart that I would do whatever it takes to love her, and that included every worst case scenario. Anyway worst case scenario happened and true to my vow I have kept my heart's love alive for her since. But God is so hard to love someone who has become so emotionally constrained to this degree. I've been burned out on her emotional constrained behaviour before. Enduring 6 months of no contact. Endured 18 months after she moved of her not letting me know where she was. This time it's been 3 years almost with no text messages whatsoever from her, never mind verbal communication, that's definitely not happening. Can I hang in there and win her heart eventually, will she ever stop constraining herself to this degree? I have too many words and emotions that I can't possibly do justice to the entire story, this is but a snippet of the whole picture. "
43,isfp,"over 5 years total of nothing sounds like she is just not interested
i cant even see a Fi user being that private or incommunicative
i know it will be hard to let go, but you probably should think about this further because that isnt behavior a Fi user would do in love, it is too detached"
44,isfp,"3 years no contact, and you're still this torn up?
You need peace, man. And some therapy to learn how to let this go. 
I realize you have 2 kids from the posts previous which complicates everything. I'm not sure the age of your children, but if they are 18+ it makes sense why there'd be no contact for 3 years. If they are under 18 then I'm not sure how there's not been any communication for that long. Do the kids live with you or her? Do you have contact with the children if they don't? 
Are you in love with her or in love with the idea of your family being together?"
45,isfp,"Gah this changes everything :( I‚Äôm sorry for what is happening. I have an ISFP husband, and he is willing and loving, even then it IS a challenging pairing. INFJ go by principles, and I totally understand being true to your word, it breaks us if we aren‚Äôt true to our principles, but ISFP don‚Äôt understand that. ISFP are true to their EMOTIONS, and that‚Äôs a different world from ours. I‚Äôm sorry you are in so much pain. I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve been stonewalled for three years, that‚Äôs awful. Sometimes I get stonewalled for four days and that‚Äôs too much for me. I can just say I will keep you in my thoughts, and hope that things get better for you."
46,isfp,"hey guys, possible ISFP here! i was wondering, is self expression that big a part in your personality? because i suck at it and it‚Äôs the only thing keeping me back from saying ISFP. and if it is, what type of self expression? "
47,isfp,"When I have some kind of pent-up emotion, or creative spark, I'll express. But mostly I just consume.  
The form it takes is usually when I move (dance), or compose  something (music) that matches how I feel (which can take a bit of trial and error, but it's very satisfying when it hits the spot). But the point is to materialise/mirror an emotion in order to feel it with a different intensity.  
I couldn't say if it's 'that big a part in your personality'. Given enough creature comforts, I could probably remain amused enough to not require self-expression. Usually anything creative I do is linked to a fantasy of some kind of aesthetic atmosphere/ambiance I want to escape/lose myself in."
48,isfp,"Well the first thing that comes to mind is, say someone asks me to do something that I think is against my system of morality or against what I think would be proper, I will find it hard to express why I feel the way I do about their request and why I wont do it. This tends to get me into arguments with people because they dont understand it. "
49,isfp,"Was googling something when i stumbled on this. 
Ouch
There is a link to the article of you want to check it out.
https://mbtimasters.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/the-harsh-truth-about-personality-types/
Maybe it's just bad article after all. What do you think?"
50,isfp,"This article says more about the person posting it than it does about any personality type. They sound like they have anger issues. It‚Äôs a shame they can‚Äôt see the beauty in the diversity of personality types.
Additionally, not everyone will like us. It is freeing to realize not everyone in life is going to like me. I may never know why, but even if it is my personality they don‚Äôt like I can accept that and go on without them."
51,isfp,"It's a bad article.
I'm not an ISFP but I really like you guys. You are endlessly fascinating people, with so much to offer and so many things to teach the rest of us. You guys can be unexpectedly hilarious, easy to be around and refreshing to chat with. I like that you guys notice the things that other people don't, and you always have a neat and fresh perspective to bring to the table. So don't feel attacked - a lot of us feel really lucky to have people like you in our lives!"
52,isfp,"ENTPs often like to screw with people so it's not surprising it was obviously written by an ENTP. What is surprising is how utterly boring and badly written it is. Most of it is more cringe-worthy than funny, and comes off like somebody trying to cram as many shocking/rude words into every paragraph they can as a replacement for actual humor.
I have to admit 'but what is... trash?' for INTPs made me laugh. My wife is an INTP and she found it funny as well. A lot of the other types are basically just 'worthless retard faggots who should commit suicide', and yeah, that's pretty viscerally upsetting and hurtful - but also it's just really not entertaining at all. There's nothing insightful or interesting or amusing there.
TL;DR: I think this is supposed to be funny, but it falls completely flat."
53,isfp,"""I hate how they take things so personally!""
(Person reading a random WordPress blog takes it personally)
Can't say I'm with ya on this one lol
Not trying to be mean, but the only reason you would feel any pain is if this applied to you (or at least you think it does). If you don't like something about yourself change it. "
54,isfp,I don't have an anime series to recommend you because I'm unsure or unaware of what types of genres you like.. But I would recommend an anime movie that I found so compelling and the art is quite beautiful. The anime is called Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms. It's more on the fantasy side. =)
55,isfp,"I recommend Youjo Senki. Although the art is a bit off in some characters (imo), I'm pretty sure the main character is an (insane) ENTJ so it could be pretty interesting to watch for an ISFP, since they're our direct opposites (unless you really don't like war series)."
56,isfp,"Let me first start off by saying I do not advocate the use of psychedelics etc.
I recently watched a TV program where they discussed the benefits of psychedelics, and the TV host himself even went to Amsterdam himself to try it. I've heard stories about how LSD has cured chronic depression and anxiety, and how it has made people turn around their lives for the better after trying it. It's also non-toxic and has been described as an anti-addictive drug (!) because of its potential to treat alcoholism and other addictions. Here in Norway we also have a political organization, EmmaSofia, working to legalize MDMA and psilocybin.
I wondered if anyone in here have any thoughts on the subject? Have you tried psychedelics and want to share your experience?"
57,isfp,"I'll reply since nobody else has. I'm only a college student, but I've tripped on LSD 4 times. I would certainly recommend it, but only to people who have researched the chemical thoroughly. Read up on other people's experiences with the chemical (erowid and /r/drugs are generally good resources). 
My experiences have been varied. The first 3 experiences were EXTREMELY eye-opening. I believe that each experience is unique, but LSD generally will give you a different lense to view the world with. You will do silly things, like look at trees for an hour or laugh uncontrollably for no reason. Your emotions will be intensified, which is why setting can be so important. A trip in the cold  night alone can make for a dreadfully scary experience, but tripping in what you perceive to be a ""safe place"" has the potential to be a terrific time.
I will emphasize again: do your research. Make sure you are actually taking LSD, and not an alternative substance, such as 25i.
I'm off to class, but let me know if you have anymore questions."
58,isfp,"I've heard pure MDMA can be very therapeutical. A friend of mine (seriously) took it and was able to talk about a past experience of abuse, which was a trauma he repressed because if he even thought about it, a lot of terrible feelings would come with it. But as he was in a blissful high, the memory and the talk didn't make him feel bad, so he was able to get it out, and now he is able to talk about it, no problem.
Either way, I recommend a safe environment and being close to at least one person you trust. I've taken low doses of LSD in various scenarios, it makes you see things (colors, perspective) in a different way, more intense maybe, and it also made me feel connected to the general happy vibe in the place I was. I also felt more inclined to do things I usually wouldn't, specially related to touch, like go into a cold pool at midnight, make out with my best friend hahaha. Just make sure you're not stressed or worried about anything, or it could turn into a bad trip"
59,isfp,"Great questions. It's been about a year since my last significant trip. In essence, I could view/perceive all my flaws, and the flaws of the people and systems around me. You wouldn't guess it now, but there are so many things that we shut out automatically, or don't realize exist. I'm not talking about otherworldly spirits or anything like that, just personality traits, thought patterns, etc. 
I understand that this description isn't very specific, but that's how it is on LSD. My thoughts wouldn't seem very substantial for a while, but a few minutes later I'd arrive at some ""earth-shattering"" conclusion. I remember towards the end of my first trip, I was laying on my friend's bed, beginning to come down. I could see (or perceive) this giant horizontal line, like a seismograph or something. As my brain whirled around in circles at a million miles an hour, the seismograph swung violently up and down. It was a bit distressing, but then I realized that the violent highs and lows were a bit representative of the stress I was experiencing in college, socially and academically. As I began to focus on myself, the line gradually flattened, and slowed down. 
I know that was a bit of a ramble, but it taught me to focus on myself, and stay in the moment. The thing about ""lessons"" brought on by LSD is that YOU are the one to interpret your experiences. Furthermore, the visuals and thoughts you have come from your own mind! Which is amazing. It's like you're exploring the subconscious of your own mind, and then using it as a learning experience to understand yourself in a different light.
As for changes in my life, there haven't been many due to the LSD. I continue to have success in school and such. I believe my main differences are in the way I subconsciously relate to people and think about things.
As for dosage, I did two 110 ¬µg tabs. LSD tabs usually either come in 110 ¬µg or 250 ¬µg. I would probably recommend 1 or 1.5 110 tabs for first time users, but I'm cautious, 2 110 tabs should be okay if you are confident.
Buy a test kit if your source isn't trusted. You DO NOT want to take a substance LSD. If the tab is sour, spit it out.
It's kind of hard to talk about LSD experiences in concrete terms with any depth, but I hope I helped. Good luck!"

Just some random music I dig. Really listen to a bit of everything. Saw you mentioned Porter Robinson. Saw him as virtual self recently, such an amazing show. "
63,isfp,"Hi ISFP community!
New user here - please bear with me if I have done any form of mistakes here, still pretty fresh with the rules and all.
So recently I have known an ISFP, and I'm just trying to get close with her as a friend. Y'all are hella interesting and goofy and has this particular charm that sucks me in.
I want to get to know her better, but I seriously got no idea how to start. I've thought of directing questions I'm curious of to her, but I'm just afraid that she may feel that I'm trying to invade her privacy/life, make her feel uncomfortable and the last thing I want to do is to scare her off from my life. (+ It is really hard to read her throughout my years on knowing her) 
On top of this, I have social anxiety issues so when it comes to even talking to people, I'm like at the level of pit bottom. I think I also need to clarify that I have a tiny slight crush on her, so unsurprisingly her existence itself manages to make my brain malfunction whenever we hang out alone.
Just a background clarification if it matters:
I am an INFP (enneagram 6w5) with horrible social anxiety and conversation skills. 
So I need advice from you guys:
- Are you guys able to advice on any kind of ways I can approach her?
- What are the signs of intimacy you guys usually show when it comes to friends and what are the differences of treatment you do between acquaintances and friends (or maybe close friends)
Sorry if there are any forms of grammar/vocab error!"
64,isfp,I absolutely love when people express their thoughts and intentions with me. I pick up on social cues sometimes but I‚Äôm afraid I misinterpret them so when someone is clear in what they mean by something then it helps me a lot. But the best thing is when I‚Äôm invited to do things and hangout with someone and get to know them more personally. So I‚Äôd advise doing that!Just focus on being friends and showing her you care by little things! Eventually the little things will start to add up and she‚Äôll have this massive realization. Maybe. 
65,isfp,"I advice you get to know her slowly and steadily. Initiate the talking, remember the little things. 
Approach : Get to know her passion, hobby, once you hit the topic, she'll be v charismatic. Don't forget to talk about your passion too! We like to listen. (Me, personally.) 
Signs of intimacy : I usually feel intimate and comfortable with the person when I can look them straight in the eyes. Difference? My humor only shines through with my close friends. With acquaintances, I don't really bother to make a comment on anything. "
66,isfp,"I can‚Äôt say for certain because I‚Äôm a Ti/Fe user BUT, Id imagine you will be much more perceptive of her attraction towards you than others since you are both Fi users. In my experience, honesty and intimacy comes from their actions, so you may find yourself totally uncertain if they‚Äôre attracted to you based on what they say in words.It may not be till you get that surprise hug that you realize their true disposition towards you. Isfp‚Äôs are touchy-feely. Don‚Äôt overlook what‚Äôs happening physically in the moment (since INFPs have a tendency to do this). 
Best wishes "
67,isfp,"Talk with her, talk about yourself and ask her questions. Find some common ground and show that you're interested to listen to her talking about her passions.
Usually if I'm interested to know someone and if that person is introvert I would even take the first step (even though I'm shy, introvert and social anxious too, I feel you so much mate), but I desperately need some cooperation because socialising is my worst skill and there's always the risk to end up in those akward moments of silence...
My signs of intimacy are: being more talkative than usual, talking about my passions (usually I'm very private with this BUT if there's some common ground that's the end because I would talk just about that), talking about the stupid things that happened the other day, usually I show my silly side and I'm all smiles and laughs.
Close friends are those people who realise how dumb and not-so-cute I can be, acquaintances usually sees me as a kind, reliable and shy girl. So, in a way, if she shows you her ""worst"" sides then it means that she feels very comfortable with you."
68,isfp,"Met (via Tinder) a girl recently and asked her to take the MBTI test: she is ISFP. I told her in return that I am INTJ. After she had read up a little on 16personalities.com, she proceeded to worry that she wasn't what I was looking for, that she was not good enough, and that I was judging her. Of course, as an INTJ, I also think that is probably true but it seemed like an over-reaction! I really appreciate MBTI and the insights it gives me into the workings of other personality types; I guess the categorisation and simplification of people also appeals to me. This is the first ISFP I have uncovered, and I'm wondering if this is a common reaction, or if there is some past issues that are affecting her? "
69,isfp,"Lol. What I think is silly about MBTI is the over-generalizing questions - people are different. It‚Äôs like asking, ‚ÄúDo ISFPs tend to hate mustard?‚Äù 
Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? 
Anyway. I think your curiosity about ISFPs is somewhat condescending, even if it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. I understand you‚Äôve never met an ISFP before, but at the end of the day, she‚Äôs just another person with different traits. Who cares?
I think she was worried by your reaction (assuming you had one since she noticed something different about you after she took the quiz,) that you were gonna pin her to her answers and view her differently because of what she got. Don‚Äôt do that, make your assumptions about her character based on your real-life impressions and experiences with her.
You shouldn‚Äôt be holding an online MBTI quiz‚Äôs results to such a high regard that you‚Äôd make this girl uncomfortable with how she responded. ‚ÄúOooooh‚Äù, ‚ÄúWow‚Äù, ‚ÄúInteresting‚Äù. I get you‚Äôre surprised but tone it down. Fascination is weird and a little dehumanizing. "
70,isfp,"No. In my experience, they don‚Äôt seem to hate MBTI, but I can see how it can be a bit nerve-wracking in a dating context. In fact ISFP seem to be the more open among the S-types, to take new theories like this in stride."
71,isfp,"It sounds like you're taking it a bit too seriously.. I think there are things in life that make people more compatable than the 4 letters they get on a given day. I always type as infj using online quizzes, but I find I relate more to isfp. Get her to take the quiz next week, she could type as something different.
If you like each other, great :p but Do you think it's wise to let an online quiz determine who you enjoy spending time with? Or do you think that could lead to self sabotage?
Sorry for the rant. I don't hate mbti. I actually enjoy reading about it, but I think it's misguided when people mould their life according to their ""type""."
72,isfp,"Hm, I personally love MBTI but sensors are often stereotyped as the people who aren't into MBTI.
As for her reply, I think she's taking it a bit too literally and the descriptions of the types aren't that good anyways."
73,isfp,"Have you ever read the type descriptions for sensors? They‚Äôre clearly written by iNtuitive types and make us sound like full blown retards on paper. You‚Äôd be better off pointing her toward real life ISFP examples like Timberlake, Brad Pitt, Britney Spears, etc."
74,isfp,"Hate to say it but it could have been a cover for not being that interested in you. A convenient out. 
Also i dont think opinion on mbti has anything to do with type. Any type can have any opinion on it. For example my intj thinks mbti is utter bullshit on the (very fair) grounds that its a pseudo science. But i dont go around assuming all intjs hate mbti.
And Its kinda awkward to ask someone to take a personality test on tinder tbh..."
75,isfp,"Do both of you a favor and don't date.
In time, you'll be frustrated as hell at her lacksadaisical attitude, emotional logic, and just plain doing things wrong (from your perspective). And she'll be tired of being told she's not doing things right and rigidity (from her perspective).
Married to an ENTP for 12 years (divorced) and have dated a few other NT types. For me, it's oil and water. Other people may have different experiences however.  "
76,isfp,Most people I matched with on there who had interest in mbti was INTJ. I found it hilarious that I seemed to match with the same people. I stay away from INTJ dating situations. They are nightmares fabricated as novelty and then ISFP just gets hurt. I'd recommend looking for someone else. INTJ will never truly understand ISFP and ISFP will never feel deeply connected to INTJ.
77,isfp,"Have to disagree with you there. We share all of the same functions. I was married to an INTJ for awhile and even though we aren‚Äôt together anymore, I have to say communication was never a problem and we‚Äôre still very much on the same page."
78,isfp,"I know a relationship is not about MBTI but love, respect and understanding, those stuffs. But still, I wanted to know what are your expectations for a long-term partner? How do you feel connected with someone? If you have specific examples, of moments, of qualities you like, etc, I would like to hear it!
‚Äã
It would be great to get insightful comments from you guys :)"
79,isfp,"They should to be supportive and accepting of me and my interests. ‚ÄúProtective‚Äù of my feelings (I.e. not argumentative, accusing, emotionally manipulative, or attempt to provoke feelings of jealousy or inadequacy) and candid about their own. Communication is key. Very high sex drive. 
Decisive and comfortable with me deferring to them on important decisions, but smart enough for me to feel comfortable doing so.
Their values should somewhat align with my own. Intelligence and a sense of humor is extremely important.
I like engaging my Se in a healthy way. It‚Äôs how I bond with my partner, for the most part. Adventures, sports, fairs, hiking, swimming, outdoor excursions, games, etc.
I really like going to trade days and Renaissance Faires and stuff."
80,isfp,"personality wise I like women who are somewhat relaxed and understand my weird sense of humor. also for some reason I connect with women who are into art/design in some capacity, maybe has been coincidental though. also women who are more feminine in appearance + behavior, but I still kind of like when they are a little more outgoing than I am, but that's more just because I can't read signals and I am not very outgoing. 
physically I like women who are in shape, stay active, etc. whether it's swimming, yoga,  lifting, or whatever it's all cool. I like lifting weights and can't imagine marrying someone who doesn't work out. again someone who likes art is also a plus- probably is the most important thing to me, so I would like to be with someone who can at least appreciate it too."
81,isfp,As a isfp I need affection and reminding how much the person loves/likes me . When I was young I use to have my boyfriend tell me the story about when he first saw me and his first thoughts & i would also have him list all the things he loves about me like all the time üòÇ I don‚Äôt know why but it was nice . I don‚Äôt know if this is a isfp thing but I‚Äôm just gonna share it anyways üôÇ be there for them !!!! . I love words of affirmation too !!  idk hope this helps üíõ
82,isfp,"Someone with no emotional baggage or bullshit. Emotionally stable and mature.
Accepts my hobbies and even if not explicitly interested, is willing to indulge me.
Goes to the gym with me. 
Affectionate but not clingy.
Overall, someone who I find interesting."
83,isfp,"I need to feel that my emotions don't make me crazy or a burden. Isfps are so based on emotion, so if my partner would snap and say why are you exaggerating or its not a big deal! It wouldn't work for me. Having a partner who knows how deeply emotional I am and reminds me that it's OK and doesn't make me crazy is the best thing that's ever happened to me! .. It really helps me flourish as a person and makes me feel supported even if I'm not always fully understood!"
84,isfp,"It has been some tense few months now with the ISFP (my SO).
Yesterday while having a bit of a tense but quiet, low voice almost-argument, I looked at him. He usually is very sensitive to me looking at him and looked at me in reply and asked ""what are you trying to find out?"" to which I replied ""im trying to understand what is bothering you"". Killer line: ""Why do you need to understand me? Just dont do it.."", said a bit angrily. I could not really reply anything in return. I know he is for some reason upset. This morning and until  now, he has not spoken to me and I still am divided between...if I should say anything or keep my guard up and let him come to me. Do you ISFPs need to feel understood, in general?"
85,isfp,"yes, the basis of relationships/friendships most isfps have is to seek understanding and empathy from the other party. if we do not feel connected to the other party, we would rather isolate ourselves. 
the thing is when consoling/seeking to understand an isfp‚Äôs issues, break down the issues you want to resolve into smaller, more manageable questions, because isfps may get flustered talking about their complex problems. this way it gives the isfp a direction on where to start talking about an issue, and slowly they will be more comfortable opening up about the details."
86,isfp,"This may just be me and not indicative of all isfp's, but when I'm upset and my SO is unsure why and asks what's wrong and I get defense and reclusive, it's usually bc I've forgotten why I'm angry. It's really frustrating bc I try and forget about the conflict (bc isfp's hate conflict) but I still feel angry so when someone tries to ask why all I have is emotion with no reason. Understandably, this can be extremely frustrating for both parties.
If given enough time I usually will remember and talk about it more gently when I'm ready but sometimes it never comes to me so that's a character flaw on my part. Not saying that this is exactly what's happening in your case but your description seems really similar to the fights me and my SO have. "
87,isfp,"hey so i enjoy reading up on mbti,and a question came to me,since isfps have fi se ni te they should have a very abstract inner world,since they only have inferior te they should be very illogical or right brained?so what is your guys experinces with this?,do you often  struggle putting certain experinces in words?,if so what are those experinces?,also how does an inner fi and ni fuse together to create realy abstract ideas?like what kinds of ideas do you guys get?"
88,isfp,"Some. For me, definitely. Especially when brain fog takes over and makes me unable to even process what I'm suppose to do. But my Te has been improving. I'll want to know both sides of an argument (and will try to understand their points of view). I start to want to be fair rather than seek mercy for everything (though this could be my Fi talking).
Not necessary experiences here (see the next question), but rather characteristics. How I'm illogical: I'm not that smart, I am quite bias and would choose a side of an argument before even listening to the points (although I am easily convinced and would move to the other side if I'm not feeling stubborn), I experience brain fog... a lot, and if you use big complicated words I'm not even listening. How I'm righted brained (although I am a little left brained): I'm creative (at least to the average sensor), put feelings over emotions, extremely laid-back, likes to relax, empathetic, and my brain fog now has taken place. Gosh dang it!
Yes. I'm even struggling to put my many experiences of this in words. :p
How am I suppose to tell you? Might as well make a picture of it since every experience I see is like a movie or cartoon from my point of view.
I just like imagining things. I'm interested in ideas but only creates abstract ideas every now and then (although I would invest in this idea I developed and try to make it make sense before moving on so that could be a reason). Usually, our ideas (or at least mine) isn't really abstract. Rather, because of our Fi, we tend to create ideas that will move people. If you really want an abstract, go to someone else who actually thinks. But if you want someone who will make you feel a specific strong emotion our Fi is bottling up, you came to the right person.
Definitely not abstract. But it really depends on my mood. If I'm sad, I'll create sad ideas. If I'm happy, I'll think of ideas that will make me even happier (usually jokes). If I'm stressed, all my ideas would be about me panicking trying to get my stuff together. You get the point.
Hoped it helped!"
89,isfp,"Not ISFP, but seeing as they mostly use Se to take in information, I would suppose they are good at creating stuff that appeals to the five senses - visual and auditory mainly. Something aesthetically appealing, that is more likely to be widely appreciated by even the average sensor type, as compared to say INFP with their more out-of-the-world Ne.
edit: Therefore what I mean is that they are not necessarily so abstract.
Would be nice for the real ISFPs here to confirm/disprove my theory!"
90,isfp,"Yeah, I write chiptune music and there's definitely a difference between artists there.  Some write very abstract music that I find almost unlistenable, but they'll criticize my music for being too ""traditional"" in return.  I guess it's a sliding scale of aesthetics to abstract, though you can combine the two if you're really good :)"
91,isfp,"I recently took the MBTI personality test and tested as an isfp. Here were the results 
Slight preference of introversion over extroversion
Slight preference of sensing over perceiving
Slight  preference of feeling over thinking 
Moderate preference of perceiving over judging 
What does this mean?"
92,isfp,"it means:
  A: you are the middle man/woman/angelic being/potato of justice or
  B: wait a few days and take the test again for more accurate results or
  C: this post is wrong and unhelpful... sorry about that..."
93,isfp,"I like how unique they are. I can‚Äôt put them in a box, I can‚Äôt stereotype them at all. They also have an independent streak that I‚Äôm quite fond of. 
Their creativity is also lovely but again it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs so unique. It‚Äôs not the stereotype of what creativity is. "
94,isfp,"I work with a couple and all three of us just non intrusively get our shit done, don't flip out about a little extra break time, and look hella stylish.  
I'm in a sort of unofficial leadership role (not because I want to be, just sort of thrown in there because efficiency) so my shadow entj comes out a little too often, but the other two are cool and quiet, friendly but unobtrusive, and never take me the wrong way and get butthurt about my stress induced entj-ness.  We all get each other.  It's great."
95,isfp,"I'm on the fence as to whether i'm an ISFP or not. I relate a lot to the descriptions and the cognitive functions, however I struggle to relate to the creativity trait that basically ALL descriptions make us out to have. I know that every individual is different and not always rigidly linked to their type description, but it makes me doubt my type a lot, especially when we're labelled 'The Artists'. Could it perhaps be enneagram related as i'm a 6 (known for being less creative/artistic, than say a type 4). Perhaps underdeveloped Se? Anyone else relate or am I probably mistyped?"
96,isfp,"I think ""artsy"" means a lot more than just drawing/painting. 
It means everything you do has a meaning, and you want to express something through reality (Fi Se relationship). 
And of course there's lots of things you can do, otherwise all ISFPs would be the same. "
97,isfp,"I don‚Äôt relate personally but there are def ISFPs who are not super artsy/creative.. the few ISFPs I know are super into sports or cooking or something else. 
I think if you relate to the functions/descriptions and ISFP fits best you‚Äôre probably ISFP. MBTI helps you figure out what kind of person you are, not who you are, so don‚Äôt sweat the details so much "
98,isfp,"I relate. I wouldn't consider myself an ""artsy"" person but I definitely enjoy hands on and practical work. Played piano for quite a few years but it definitely did not come naturally and was something I had to work really hard to learn.
Not underdeveloped Se. Just a generic typing. "
99,isfp,"Sorry, I'm late to comment, but I just subscribed to this sub because I figured out my husband is an ISFP recently (I'm an INFJ).  
So my husband isn't someone you'd describe as ""artsy"", but he is super visual & works well with his hands.  He's handy meaning he can fix pretty much anything, can sew, builds stuff, is athletic, an outdoor adventurer & has a good sense of style when it comes to design.  He is a dentist which requires aesthetic ability.  I think the label ""artist"" is broader than just painting, drawing, etc.    "
100,isfp,"How do you find the sensory descriptions in novels, good or lacking?
Are they limited compared to your own perception of the world or are you able to fill in the details with your imagination?
Do you prefer detailed description or description telling only the most important details?"
101,isfp,"It depends on the novel and the writer. If it's outside environment is not that important to me, I'm ok with just having some indications and I'll fill in the gaps. Even if I get additional info further on, it's ok. When it's the inside of buildings, houses, I prefer having details about the plan, the light, the colours, the objects so that I can make the right image in my head and play what I read as a movie. I don't like it when I imagine a door on the left and later on the writer mentiones someone going through the door ON THE RIGHT. It messes up the picture I had and sometimes I have to re-imagine the room and stuff inside...ugh."
102,isfp,"It depends on the type of book. Usually I get bored if the author does way too detailed of a description of a place, but sometimes it's necessary or well written enough that it is OK.  If the book is funny (Hitchhiker's Guide) then the descriptions are the best part.  Like others who responded, I make the book play out like a movie in my head, and if the scene is frozen to fill in minute unnecessary details over and over again with the characters actually doing something every 5 minutes, then I might as well not watch...."
103,isfp,"Character development for me is more difficult to follow or ""imagine"" than places. A good development is subtle. Maybe I find hard to relate to characters in books etc and I'm more attuned to imagine myself n that situation as myself."
104,isfp,"Though I don't read novels too much anymore, this is how it worked for me when I did.  Outdoors settings I can fill in on my own (unless there's an important ""set peice""),  but I need that description for indoors. "
105,isfp,"My most significant experience with an ENTP was with my primary school ex-classmate. It was the worst
I'd share more but I have to go to shop so."
106,isfp,Never once have I come out of a friendship with an ENTP without having been completely torn to shreds on multiple occasions. I've learned my lesson. Don't fuck with an ENTP. Nothing to do with and ENTP is worth it. Nothing. 
107,isfp,"Oh wow everyone‚Äôs had terrible experiences with ENTPs. The only ENTPs I‚Äôve met have been super fun and entertaining, cause I actually really like their humour. The one ENTP that I actually made pretty good friends with in particular was great, though at times he did mess with people more than I thought was okay. I also really like most of the ENTPs I‚Äôve met online... though certainly not all. I guess online is the only place I‚Äôve really had any bad experiences with ENTPs. "
108,isfp,"Had a really close friendship. She was great and caring but she made some critical remarks (it was while we were working on something) in a way that kinda destroyed me? I normally don't get that emotional but I literally stopped went to the bathroom and cried. I didn't say anything, put it away and continued our friendship. 
She moved away and really stopped putting effort into the friendship which I am still trying to get over today."
109,isfp,"My best friend is an ENTP and we're like peas in a pod. He's really entertaining, understanding and we're very close. We have had many debates about things but he is always understanding and listens to every point of view, and never makes it argumentative, it's always more of a discussion. I also think he has a great sense of humour - we find each other hilarious. I don't think I've had a bad experience with an ENTP, but I don't really know very many, the ones I know seem to be fine though!"
110,isfp,"I think the best thing that could have happened was the fact that we stopped talking. This sounds dramatic, but she was like a black hole for my confidence and just being around her made me feel so small. Hell, even years later I decided to browse her tumblr and it gave me the same feeling even though she just reblogged game memes and stuff. I think it gets better in time when you unlearn all the negative thoughts you have about yourself as a result of being friends with them. "
111,isfp,"Being a introvert I am generally pretty bad at making friends. I can see this throughout my life. While I don't wish to be friends with probably 90% of the people I meet, that letter ""f"" still persists. Funny how we long for feeling and expression when our social skills are inherently weak and clumsy. Yeah I dont want a lot of friends, but even with the two or three good ones I have right now I still feel lonely. I stared working retail last year and made good friends with my coworkers and that really improved my social skills. I think I've reached the point in my life where that ""f"" is taking over and making me very emotional about not having a girlfriend and honestly a wife. Call me crazy but this maturity thing hit me like a truck. I am a different man than who I was two years ago. Here I am talking to a bunch of people I don't know much about other than a common personality type just because I want that sense of having some close to talk to. Thanks for being my wife reddit. Yes I know I'm insane, but that's the card I was dealt."
112,isfp,"I feel this way too :( love can be a distraction though. If you look over at the exfx forums, they pine over an imagined other half too. Even the thinkers do this. So at least you're not alone at feeling lonely"
113,isfp,"Don't be greedy, most of us would be content with either a gf or a wife :-D 
...Sorry. Regarding social skills, there's a lot of advice flying around along the lines of ""fake it till you make it"", ""assume rapport"", etc. Amazingly, all of it is true. Just practice acting like you're an extrovert, and it becomes a skill you can pull off with relative ease when you need it. 
(The difference to actually being an extrovert is that you still have to actively make the choice to put in an effort, I think.) "
114,isfp,"I don't really feel this way. I'm an introvert, and I'm bad at starting conversations and making friends, but I practice anyway. I don't want to be friends with 90% of the people I meet, but when I meet someone who has stuff in common with me, I put myself out there. Being vulnerable is scary but it pays off.
I've also been happily single for the last 4 years. I might get into a relationship if I really find someone compatible, but for now just sharing a house with my two flatmates and having a few really great close friends is more than enough for me to be happy. Invest in yourself. Friends and wives come and go, but you have to live with yourself for your whole life. "
115,isfp,I am starting nursing school (RN program) in September and would love to hear your nursing experience as an ISFP. How do you like it? What are your strengths/ weaknesses that you see as an ISFP? Any advice for a fellow ISFP entering nursing school/ nursing field? Anything you would like to share? It can be anything! Thank you‚Ä¶ I would greatly appreciate anything you have to say ÔÅä
116,isfp,"I'm sorry I can't answer most of your questions, I'm tagging along to hear answers as well. I'm an ISFP who is only in my second semester of classes for nursing (still taking the pre-reqs) and would love to hear from others about their experiences too!"
117,isfp,"Lol omg this made me so self conscious. Like looking in a mirror. Am I as pretentious as this guy? Probably. Shit :( and esp how the ENFP is just so clearly bored and FiNi is caught up in his concepts he doesn't know how to dial it back. This is why I don't socialise.
Edit: ok but as I watch more I have to say the guy is self aware enough to realise that he isn't really doing himself favours with the tribe and I commend him for that. Coming to the same realisation myself and hoping to work on that demon Te. It's a lot of work, especially when your internal world does cloud everything... Thanks for sharing this is really helpful.
Edit2: watched the whole thing, probs overreacted a little bit soz. as they say seeing your type is kind of traumatic. actually really enjoyed this conversation, both really grew on me, the ISFP is on point about how to grow from your typology blindspots and it was all really fascinating :) thanks!"
118,isfp,"@spacegirl01 Thanks for sharing what you got out of that video. I'm the ENFP interviewer and I wasn't bored talking to him but I was definitely surprised at how self-absorbed an ISFP Fi-Ni can be.
I do like the fact that Julien knows himself really well and that hopefully he can work on that demon Te much more.
I'm glad you enjoyed the interview and got a chance to learn more about your personality type and seeing your blindspot by watching it from an outside perspective! :)"
119,isfp,"Haha yeah you looked pretty weirded out as he just launched into his ideas without any prompts, anyone would be! Yeah we can be pretty self absorbed and alienating but we do care about others a lot, we're just incompetent at curating a good vibe when we're in Ni mode. I guarantee he could feel Fi that he was losing you but he didn't know why or what to do and so he stuck to his Ni to diffuse the awkwardness. Love the video series you're doing though, it's super interesting to see all the types in action! Keep it up!"
120,isfp,"I'm walling up again. A friend of mine hurt me, but I don't want to be the fragile little thing I really am. I feel guilty for feeling hurt because I know it wasn't their intent. I wish I could truly be as stoic and uncaring as the front I try give off, but my emotions feel like a bruise that someone keeps poking. 
  I guess I'm looking for advice. Do any of you guys relate? If so, how do you deal with these feelings?"
121,isfp,"I get you ;-;
No matter how hard I try, I've always been really open with people but since I started college I've almost completely walled myself off just so I won't get hurt again. I make friends in my mind ""too quickly"" if that makes any sense, and end up scaring people away. 
Since then I've left my room maybe twice a week and entered a cycle of skipping class. Being too anxious to approach my professors, skip the next class to avoid conflict. Repeat. 
I don't know how to help you but know you aren't alone. It gets better, someday, somehow. We'll get there. Much love. "
122,isfp,"I feel yea; I have people who I thought were going to be life long friends stab me in the back. It hurts and I wanted to give up on people. The thing though is that there are people like us out there who want relationships, but are scared of getting hurt. I guess that wants motivates me to go out there, and talk to people, and be open with them. I being honest when I say this; I have meet people who lives suck and they feel hope from people like me, and I feel the same with them. I have not lived the worst life ever; I am not saying that. Its just a beautiful connector were both parties have felt pain and love each other over it.     "
123,isfp,"It's not that I wanted to give up on people, I just feel like I'm a slave to my emotions. That the logical side of my brain thinks I'm blowing things out of proportion, while my emotional side was still hurt and in control. Anyways after walling up for a while I ended up talking with my friend. Things are better now. Thanks for taking the time to comment on my post."
124,isfp,"Hi all ISFPs... 
A few days ago, my ISFP husband told me he wasn't happy in our marriage, and he wants to leave me. He's been very specific in communicating that he's not unhappy with me in particular, but instead seems to feel he's too broken/messed up for a healthy relationship. He's been a bit depressed lately, but things in our lives have generally been going well. For example, he recently got a raise at work, and we've been talking about having a baby soon. But, seemingly out of the blue, he's decided our marriage has to go... And that there's nothing I can do. He's expressed concern that I am not actually happy in the marriage, and he's expressed that he feels fear of hurting me. He's also said that he has unintentionally attached a lot of negative feelings (shame, anxiety) and childhood traumas to how he views me, and he feels like untangling them/removing those attachments is impossible. He says, ""I wish I felt like I had another solution."" 
There is still a lot of love. We're still very friendly with each other. We even talked a long time and held hands for a while this morning while we talked. We seem to be communicating very well about our feelings, it feels like a two way street. I definitely don't want him to go, and other than asserting that he wants to go, he doesn't really seem like he actually wants to go. 
I'm not really sure what to do. I'm trying to let him go, but I'm simultaneously communicating about ways in which it (a) isn't entirely his fault that these bad attachments exist, and (b) that it isn't impossible to untangle those attachments, although it will take time. We've been through about 6-7 hours of couple's therapy together, which has already seemed to do a lot in exposing these bad attachments. I really just want him to keep giving us a chance to do the healing work we need to do... So, I'm mindfully asking him to stay another few months, so we can keep sorting through the hard stuff. He hasn't said yes, but... He also hasn't said no. So, in the meantime, I'm still going to try to actively work on changing my side of the bad attachments. I'm going to work on giving him a lot more positive feedback, and I am going to try to cut out being overbearing or too idealistic.
TL;DR Husband associates me with negative feelings/abuse, doesn't blame me, loves me a lot still, but wants to go anyways. I am asking him to stay another 2-3 months and keep giving therapy a chance to change our interactions.
The question for ISFPs... What would you want, in this situation? What could make you feel more hopeful about the future in this situation? What could make you feel like you can affect real change? "
125,isfp,"Perhaps he needs a change of pace in life. Can you both try taking a break and giving each other space for a couple months? He should go to individual therapy to sort out his mind before joining you again. Joining you again may mean something else besides marriage. I know as an ISFP I get really stuck in a rut when everything is routine and want to uproot and change anything I can control. Also do you know each other's love languages? Perhaps insight on that would help you love him in a way that he would resonate with. Best of luck, I can see that you love him so much and are so willing to work things out."
126,isfp,"ISFPs dislike thinking about the future. Because often... the future comes to haunt them. Maybe you weren‚Äôt there enough for him? Not spontaneous enough. Only thinking about the future and planning all that. That could have felt like an invasion of Ni and Te to him. Instead of trying to find what to do to solve it, try to be with him in the here and now. Cook together. Travel together. Swim together. ISFPs can only look at the future in a positive light when their present life is full of action and spontaneity and things to explore. 
Of course. There is a high chance that my advice is misdirected and inaccurate. But I don‚Äôt even know you two. So excuse me if I‚Äôm assuming incorrectly. 
Good luck. "
127,isfp,"Oh noes! I‚Äôm INFJ, 38/F, married 6 years to ISFP. We exchanged a few words very briefly in one of the threads a while back, but I‚Äôve been silently rooting for you ever since I found out you had an ISFP. I hope that things work out!"
128,isfp,"We'd planned a break/separation last winter, but as the break approached, he begged me to be able to stay at home and work with me instead of be forced not to contact me. We decided last January that we were going to stay together and work on it, no matter what it takes. That's just another reason why it feels so bizzaro to have him suddenly want to leave...
The thing is, if joining me again doesn't mean marriage/family, I honestly don't think I'd want him to join me again. I think I would be heartbroken, and would begin to resent him for every milestone he has with anyone else, when we were supposed to have them together. At least, that's been my experience with past exes... See: INFJ door slam.
His love languages are quality time and physical touch. However, it is often the case that he is the one that doesn't accept my invitations for activities/dates, or doesn't want to cuddle/be sexual, with little ability to explain why. It seems to have something to do with shame and trauma. At the same time, my love languages are gift giving and acts of appreciation. He doesn't usually know what to get me/only gets me things I ask for, and his household chore/task completion motivation is... lacking. When I get frustrated that things are not done, this amplifies the shame.
Shame is really the thing driving a wedge between us.
Thanks for your input and well wishes"
129,isfp,"I often worry that he doesn't think I am ""fun"" or good to play with, anymore. But, really confirm/deny this is how he feels? Like, the idea of it doesn't even seem to land, when I ask...
Re: Being Present - In the past, when we've scheduled some kind of regular date night or together activity, things have gone really well. However, we both have ADHD and struggle with maintaining routines/structure. So, eventually, whatever the new together activity is starts to get old/boring, and we fall out of the routine of doing it, without replacing it. I also find that our marriage has been stronger when we've spent at least 20 hours/week interacting face to face or doing the same activity.  
This is one of the reasons I am asking him to stay. We've had good periods of having a strong marriage in the past, and I really think we can have a strong marriage long term! I don't understand why feeling kind of frustrated/hopeless for a few weeks, after months of feeling hopeful, means... asking for divorce.
‚Äã"
130,isfp,"DH and I are both 26, and we've been together for 7 years, and married for 5 years... I don't remember what thread we talked in, but thank you for rooting for us!
Do you have any advice/insight you can share with me? I know personalities aren't everything, and every individual has their nuance.. But, I feel like I am just approaching my husband wrong, and he's tired of his attempts to love me not landing, and my attempts to love him not landing... I'm tired of it, too. It's very frustrating."
131,isfp,"Nope, not really. But, things have been slowly deteriorating for a long time, as each of us have gone through periods of depression at different times in the relationship. However, I think things really broke down when I went through a period of depression about 3 years ago, during which he took on another lover (we are poly, I consented at the time...), and then as I came out of my depression, he fell into a new one. During his depression, he started to really cling to this other lover, as they were both grieving dead family members. I eventually began to feel really lonely and discarded/unwanted, and that's when I asked the relationship with the other lover  to stop. He said he would stop, but the relationship didn't stop, so then I asked for a separation. In the face of this, my husband stopped the other relationship, and worked really hard to win my trust and get me to reverse my decision. But, now 8 months later, after making plans to have kids next year, he's the one that wants to go... And he doesn't just want a separation, but he wants a divorce. It's very confusing.
He's pretty happy with his job. He's a plumber, and he's really good at what he does! I'm very proud of him because he is both happy with his work and good at it. I tell people about it all the time, because he's come so far and worked so hard. I'm really so proud."
132,isfp,"I think the biggest issue for INFJ/ISFP, is our collective streak, versus their individualistic streak. They want to be themselves, and we want harmony. Even the more individualistic INFJs can find the ISFPs 'me first' attitude a bit off-putting. We have a disorderly inner world, and they have a disorderly outer world. Sometimes, in our effort to put our own outer worlds in order, we might impeach upon their outer world. Thus the common ISFP complaint that we can be too 'oppressive and controlling,' and we in turn may see them as 'irresponsible and rebellious.'
We value others, they value being true to yourself. We value community, they value those in their inner circle. We are neutral when approaching strangers ... they tend to be distrusting of strangers and new people.
Also ... I tend to do things I don't really like, for his sake, or for anyone's sake, really, and he sees this as being disingenuous ... I see it simply as doing the right thing. If I were to only do things that I REALLY WANTED to do, I'd probably degenerate into all kinds of addictive and childish behaviours.
How to sort this out?
I don't know, haha. Humanity has never solved this problem, and I don't think we can either. But if you haven't gotten your own counsellor yet, it might be helpful to do so, just to get your own inner world in order. And maybe also I'll leave you with this -love covers over a multitude of transgressions."
133,isfp,"I'm an INFP (I think, but I could be one of you) but hi :) My room is currently an aqua color. I think it's a beautiful representation of who I was when I was little. Most little girls enjoyed pink colors, but I was unique and dared to venture into the realm of blue. Now, though, I think I'd like something a little more wistful...perhaps a dreamy lavender, like the color of the sky before it melts into a sunset, or a soft, bittersweet gray. I've definitely become a little more reserved and thoughtful as I've grown older...although my youthful innocence is not completely lost."

135,isfp,"ISFJ here. We've been going for a couple of dates. I really like that we got very comfortable with each other, and we clicked instantly. We both really like physical intimacy so that's a plus point. I feel that he is a little shy and not really expressive through texts and sometimes can be a little quiet. Sometimes i feel he doesn't take on subtle hints for compliments and doesn't reciprocate, which can be a little annoying at times. I have to put him in the spotlight and then he'll respond. I like to make plans and he follows suit as well, which can be tiring because I'm the one always planning ahead. However, he is very relaxed and chill which i feel so at ease every time, so i guess that's a good sign. I know it's still early on in the dating scene but how do i progress our relationship to the next level? Do ISFPs go out of their way to get what the other party wants? I'm afraid our relationship will just be seen as 'hanging out'."
136,isfp,"Well, if he is anything like me (me being an ISFP) then his going to want to know that you are both on the same page. Whenever me and my girlfriend (an INTJ) decide to take our relationship to the next level I always feel the need to make sure that she feels the same as me. Just being reassured that the person you are with have the same emotions as yourself helps a lot. 
I would say (depending on how long you guys have been dating) take things slow and just build up that communication, let him know how you feel so that he becomes more comfortable to do the same."
137,isfp,"I would say take it slow and let things develop naturally. Eventually after a while if things keep going as they are you'll inevitably have the ""so what are we"" conversation. If you feel ready to have that conversation now I would say go ahead and bring it up. You might be on the same page already but he's just chill with how things are going now and not in any sort of hurry. I'd say if things are going well now chances are you're on the right track."
138,isfp,"As an isfp, I have to put a lot of mental effort into verbal communication. I think he needs to understand that he needs to as well. Its easy for us to get comfortable in relationships because they feel good, it's just you and one other person, and we're so content with that. 
I'm comfortable just hanging out at home, but as soon as I'm in the outdoors, I'm much happier. Not only that, but from the stimulation of the senses, I'm more comfortable communicating verbally. Maybe when he understands his personality more, and understands your genuine concerns, he will make the decision to put more effort into communicating and planning.
Edit: I hate texting by the way, I prefer less lean forms of communication"
139,isfp,"I'll always hold back a little until I know how the other person feels, which I know is unfair but I'm just so bad at expressing myself until I feel comfortable with someone. Don't push it though, he'll come out of his shell as the relationship naturally progresses. Also, I'm terrible at being interesting over text and find it exhausting. If I have something interesting to tell someone I'll often save it until I see them in person, so that we'll have more to talk about. I also HATE being affectionate over text. It feels weird. I'm so much more expressive in person. It's a good sign that you've picked up all of these things.
Edit- also, planning things stresses me out because I don't like influencing someone else, and will be anxious that they'll have a bad time. If I dont know someone well enough to know if they'd like something I leave it up to them. I'm working on it, though."
140,isfp,"When you feel the time is right I'd suggest bringing it up to him and talking about it directly, in person, ideally. My ex and current partner (isfj and esfj) both ended up doing this. I was happy to reciprocate their feelings but I was never gonna bring up the topic myself."
141,isfp,"How do you work on your personality? How do you make the best out of it and avoid the negative potholes that are characteristic of the isfp profile? 
If you've succumbed to one or more of the negative traits, how do you turn it around? 
EDIT: Found a really good article about just this!
http://personalitycafe.com/isfp-articles/114117-isfp-personal-growth.html  


Take care to notice what people look like in different social situations. Look at their hair, their skin, their makeup (or lack thereof), their clothes, the condition of their clothes, their shoes, their facial expressions. Don't compare others to your own appearance, or pass judgment on their appearance, simply take in the information.
Think of a situation in your life in which you weren't sure how to behave. Now try to understand how one or two other people would see the situation. Don't compare their behavior to your own, i.e. ""she would know better than me what to do"", or ""why is it so easy for her, but so hard for me"". Rather, try to understand how they would see the situation. Would it be seen as a problem, or as an opportunity? Would it be taken seriously or lightly? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or comparing it to your own.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time to talking about the other person. Concentrate on really understanding where that person is coming from with their concerns. Ask questions.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself ""this person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life than they are with mine."" Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is doing right now. What things are they encountering, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or compare their situation to your own. 
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any length of time.

"
142,isfp,"routines help, also being around other people helps me to adapt to better myself. I am a monkey see monkey do kinda person basically learning from others examples of good and bad traits. Being in school (mainly college but also high school) and watching how people interact with each other. Also being around social situations and not having to be social at first helps me to become more comfortable not to let my inner monologue only be in my head. I know it maybe wrong but also being around people who are not afraid to let themselves make mistakes or fools of themselves helps me to be okay with having errors. "
143,isfp,"Keeping a journal has been helpful. I originally wanted to write a page in it every day, but now I just write in it once or twice a week and it's pretty disorganized. I'll put random thoughts or lists or drawings or whatever and sometimes it'll be the traditional journal entry type thing.  "
144,isfp,"Late to party, but I like to think of self improvement as: us, knifes that need sharpening to cut well in life. We should sharpen ourselves against the stone that is life experience. Some strokes may suck at first, but after a few you get the hang of it. Soon you'll you'll have one sharp knife!"
145,isfp,"Well as I understand it if you don't maintain your positive sides of your ISFP personality traits you can involuntarily enhance some bad sides. Like for example in discussions with your spouse you take every negative thing said as personal criticism.
Or you only see things that correlate with your personal values, everything else gets brushed away as unimportant.
You start not caring for other people like you used to.
Things like that."
146,isfp,"Well, the easiest advice that I can give is to ask other constantly what their opinions are on different items, and mold your interactions around the responses you receive. 
Of course, this shouldn't go so far as to change your core character, but making sure to have an up-to-date mental copy of those around you can help you decide what you're losing and how to retain your balance."

148,isfp,"That's a good thing to notice. It's easy to escape your troubles in a video game, TV series or a bottle. Leave notes and reminders on places you are drawn to look often. Maybe on your phone, maybe on your bathroom mirror with a dry erase marker. Whatever it takes.
Don't forget that life happens outside of work and that what may seem like a waste of time is actually cultivating your relationships with others or what makes you interesting as a person. It's easy to beat oneself up over ""not getting enough work done"".
Have a creative outlet. It will help you deal with stress and give you a tangible reward for your time spent on it."
149,isfp,"nepsling got it right. Work is important to achieving one's goals, but don't forget why you have the goals in the first place. We have a limited time in this universe, and filing paperwork for 90% of your life is never going make for a happy life. I too get hooked by games, shows, and drinks, but as long as I can remind myself every so often that they don't define me, I can escape them and get back to pursuing my goals. Having fun may not be enough to rid yourself of stress later on if you find yourself repeating the same kinds of fun over and over again. This is where the creative outlet comes in handy, as you can always create something new to have fun with."
150,isfp,"Keep working out, maybe do a pull up one day (I'm a girl with wimpy arms), and maybe start studying again so I can get a better job... It's hard though :P  I'm pretty happy where I am, just enjoying day by day"
151,isfp,"Mope around for a week feeling ashamed of myself.  Eventually sever all ties with that person and attempt to move on with my life.  (I make it sound a little dramatic but that's pretty much how it happens)
This isn't mbti related but recently I learned that as an Enneagram type four, my primary emotion is shame.  I think that makes rejection worse.  Also in that Enneagram thread we had it seemed there were quite a few fours here, so I thought maybe there's some correlation with ISFP."
152,isfp,Not too well. I feel like I've done something horribly wrong and beat myself up about it for days and weeks to come. What could I have done better? What did I do wrong? Was I the real reason for the rejection or was it something else?
153,isfp,"I am an ENTP, my very helpful ISTP friend is telling me I should find ISFPs to hang out with, but I can't seem to find anyone around me. Just ENFPs and INTPs everywhere :D So, where do you guys visit on a regular basis? Where can I find you?"
154,isfp,"Go to your nearest forest/nature reserve. Should find a couple roaming about - maybe up a tree.
Lmao but in all seriousness look for the quiet ones. We‚Äôre the people who sit at the back quietly taking stuff in. Which will be why you don‚Äôt seem to notice us. Keep an eye out for those who are quietly experiencing things - likely on their own. Strike up a friendly chat if you think the times right. They‚Äôll probably hate it at first, but if you‚Äôre friendly and non-judgmental they‚Äôll appreciate you taking the time to talk.
As for actually where - idk. Probably not bars and super crowded areas though. "
155,isfp,"Personally, I‚Äôm not that into reading. But that‚Äôs just me; don‚Äôt take it as a generalisation! Cafes is a good idea though. Worth a try!
And yeah, nature is definitely a go to. Try those scenic walks you know; I‚Äôll often just stroll around them or stop on a bench - take it all in. I think we all love walking. It‚Äôs such a beautiful, relaxing thing. Good luck!"
156,isfp,i am pretty adverse to beimng approached in public by complete strangers - i'll be wondering what tf you want lol unless you strike the right vibe. i'd try finding isfps in a hobby group instead like an art class or a book club maybe.
157,isfp,"I am usually in the backyard around a bonfire picking guitars and singing with my intp husband and enfp cousin, or taking long walks (we live in the country) with my doggo. You wont catch many of us in loud clubs. Lol. Try a hiking trail, quieter music scene, church maybe (many other isfps i know are very spiritual). "
158,isfp,"I suppose it would help to have a job or hobby where you interact with a lot of people, like a dental hygienist or a nurse.
One of the girls I liked the most in my life was a hygienist, I felt very comfortable right away and it turned out we had a ton in common.
I have a hard time in situations that feel forced, like if someone just comes up to me at a park or something.  I have also never really actively tried to find people to date.
Maybe you can find them walking dogs? idk, I've thought about getting a dog, I think it would be easier to meet people that way, otherwise I'm just at home a lot."
159,isfp,"how about bookstores and bookstore cafes? Every time I go after the quiet and reserved one, I end up with an INTP, and boy we do not match! 
But nature is a good tip, looks like picnic season just started. Thanks!"
160,isfp,"I haven‚Äôt been to a bookstore in years lol. I usually hang out with friends in Cafes or walking along the ocean or in parks or whatever. Maybe go to a craft/music store üòÇ.
Edit: just realized you already commented on the bookstore thing lol."
161,isfp,Hmmm im down for pizza and im okay to eat anything but any kind of pizza with feta cheese sounds amazing rn. I think you should make the order what you want and we will split the bill. Idk if you live anywhere remotely close to me so that could be a slight issue but im down to play some video games online
162,isfp,"hahaha yes, I caught myself after I commented. I am not very musical, and i am looking for a male which probably won't go to a crafts store much. Any other suggestions?

I will definitely do the parks. Also, what kind of conversation starters do you appreciate the most?"
163,isfp,"cause you guys are always home, the only way to get to you is to become a plumber or anything home service related. i can't just come knock on your door and say ""hey I noticed you stay home too much, that makes me think you might be an ISFP, wanna hang out?"" hahaha, you will call the police on me. "
164,isfp,"Lol an ISFP male might go to a craft store;).  But yeah, I almost always hang out with people outside. As stereotypical as it might sound, if a place is pretty, has caffeine (etc. lol), animals/kids, or music, I‚Äôm there. 
As for conversations, it really depends who it is. In general, most of my conversations are centered are humor or inside jokes. Maybe ask them if they watch your favorite show or something. I always try to show people memes from the Office. 
I think I only know one ENTP in person. I honestly didn‚Äôt like him at first because he came across as more abrasive then he truly is. We‚Äôre friends now (although not super close) and we usually actually talk about politics. I don‚Äôt think it really matters much what you talk about, as long as you remember that ISFPs tend to be very independent, but also don‚Äôt typically like confrontation, so maybe stay away from touchy subjects, at least initially. Ask about their interests or whatever. Hopefully that‚Äôs helpful:)."
165,isfp,"Edit: I have closed the survey. Basic preliminary data is available here: link
Hi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.
I also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at this link to google forms
It is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.
If you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.
Please don't spoil the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.
I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know."
166,isfp,Understandable. I‚Äôm an INTJ by the way but I would suggest finding things he likes and maybe spark up a short convo when you see him. Do this a number of times then either he‚Äôll get the hint or you gotta be straight forward 
167,isfp,"Well are you gonna try to speak to the kid or not? If you've already given up on ever speaking to the kid, then stop thinking about the kid.
You first have to decide if you want to speak to the kid or not. It seems like you don't want to."
168,isfp,"Only a couple options here that I can see and I may be wrong. 
Find the problems and solve them if you can 
If you can‚Äôt solve them no matter what then the only choice would be to accept them and move on... "
169,isfp,"Holy crap, i've always felt bad for being introverted. My mother would always ask me if i had any friends or why i so rarely brought any over. 
I always thought i was wrong to not wanting to go out every weekend or to meet up with friends after scool or work. And every time i tried to work on my social life i became exhausted, i couldnt handle more than a couple of days. I didnt have any problems talking to people when i was younger, i talked to anyone about anything until i felt there was nothing to talk about and then i could be silent for the rest of the day. But society and my parents always questioned it so eventually i did too, and the only answer i could find was that im just very anti-social and shy since its not ok to be happy and wanting to be alone.
Jesus what a mindtwister and eyeopener this was for me."
170,isfp,If I'm drunk I turn into everyone's mom (I'm a dude). I just go around the room asking if people are okay and making sure people don't need water because they drank too much too fast without hydrating.
171,isfp,"Drunk depends on my mood. Sometimes I can have really deep meaningful conversations with my GF about our future/morals/what we want in life. Other times I just fuck around having fun and don't remember shit in the morning. 
High (opiates), I used to lay in bed with my eyes closed and chill the fuck out while listening to music. "
172,isfp,"Drunk - Happy, talkative and headachey.
High - I am able to see ideas and thoughts objectively. I can turn on and off different senses (ex. Ignore temperature, ignore my full bladder and stomach, focus on sounds). I also start seeing shapes in my environment and my body... drawing helps to express the images I see). I prefer to be alone or in a small crowd or else it can be very overwhelming for me. Touch becomes super sensitive and laying in bed can be a little uncomfortable. "
173,isfp,"When I'm drunk I'm either tired, depressed, or texting. When I'm high I feel like I'm in a Miyazaki film and start noticing the little details in life that are missed when sober. It's cool to go to parks and people watch and see all of the little scenes happening everywhere.  "
174,isfp,"well it really depends on the high. weed makes me like a normal person. i'm able to leave my house and not wanna kill myself. 
shrooms make me really dark and serious. like i start looking at everything as being like god or some shit, like im just in total awe of everything. 
booze makes me depressed, or angry.
xanax makes me into the hulk.
ex makes me super horny. really all stims do.
MXE and DXM make everything wavy and weird.
DPH is a panic attack in some pills.
i could go on, but i think i've covered all the classes of drugs i've sampled."

176,isfp,"So a while ago I made the ""Share your art stuff tastes"" thread, but this isn't that. I've seen on the INFP subreddit that people just post their art as a thread often, but that doesn't happen here. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm guessing that's because in such a small group we don't want to put ourselves on a pedestal since it won't be buried beneath other posts soon, lol.
So basically I made this so you can share whatever art you've made here that you want to! It can be drawing, photography, music, film, dance... anything! I know not all ISFPs do art, but I thought this would be nice for the ones that do. c:"
177,isfp,"This is fun idea! 
https://imgur.com/a/P7Gmf
I included two recent photos I took and some of my favorite artworks. I do a lot of  portraits, with markers. My art isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúimaginative‚Äù or ‚Äúcreative‚Äù but I do enjoy simply drawing/recreating what I see in my own style. I also love photography, mostly nature, self-portraits, and taking pictures of my kitties! "
178,isfp,"I took this picture the other day that I really liked.  
I much preferred the smoke pattern in this one, but the sky colors weren't coming out as nicely, and my attempts at editing still weren't getting it to a good enough point for it to be satisfying.
Also I've been really wanting to paint the last frame of this video in watercolor, but a combination of not being sure whether I want to do it in color or b&w plus not actually having any paints or decent paper has been postponing actually doing it."
179,isfp,"Okay, this is a work in progress but what I have so far is complete. There's going to be some ambience at the beginning and one more part, but I'd call this my best piece yet. https://soundcloud.com/threeblacksevens/eternality
I made it on an app called Beatwave, it's pretty cool. I'd love to have a recording studio to record real instruments though, lol."
180,isfp,"Ooh! I love the second photo and the second drawing! It kind of looks like David Tenant. Most of my photography is heavily photoshopped, but after seeing that I may get back into trying out raw photography again."

182,isfp,"Super cool! And awesome post idea. I also make some music, and even though it's pretty different, I really enjoyed it and especially the fact that a much louder sound comes in at some point in the track. I also enjoy doing this and it's not all that common :) ok so I guess I'll leave mine then. NSFW wallpaper though. http://outdoor-leisure.skyrock.com"
183,isfp,"I lived on a boat for 6+ yrs, in a marina. Worked on land. Learned to live without tv, and blow drying my hair. Also learned to downsize, and anything new coming on the boat...something similar had to leave. "
184,isfp,"I started using a blanket instead of a pillow. Its much more comfortable. I can form its width differently each night. I can also trade out my pillow blanket with my blanket if I want to. I dunno. The bed is more interesting now, Also I don't have to put pillow cases on anymore either. Plus those fleece blankets make dope ass pillows."
185,isfp,"Its easier to share it whenever you have someone over. They look at you like you're a fucking psycho though. Its easier to wash. Machine washing a pillow they always come out lumpy for the first night or two.  If you want to you can wrap it around your head to block out light without sacrificing having it under your head. Its much more comfortable. If its particularly cold one night you have the option to sacrifice your pillow for an extra blanket without having to get up.
Recommendation: Those fleece blankets work very well for this. They are warm and fluffy. Almost seems to be how they were meant to be used."
186,isfp,"I just wanted to share some traits I have.
‚Äã
‚Ä¢ I have a terrible sense of location and I get lost in my city and in open world video games very easily.
‚Ä¢ If I get bored, I get depressed.
‚Ä¢ I like to express myself with drawings but I hate to spend a long time doing one.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm not super aware of changing details or the environment. Actually I never noticed many details.
‚Ä¢  It is as if things always lack a little piece of something to be completely meaningful. No activity that I know fills me completely. No goal excites me enough because I always think something like ‚Äúand then what?‚Äù.
‚Ä¢  I always had trouble figuring out what to do to earn money. I‚Äôm 24 and I  studied 3 years of visual arts to left the university. Now I‚Äôm going to study to be a language teacher and a translator.
‚Ä¢ I can be very judgey sometimes.
‚Ä¢ I have stages of very good self-discipline, healthy diet, without missing excercise days, etc.
‚Ä¢ I can find it really hard to find something to say in a conversation, and also I have trouble speaking fluently.
‚Ä¢  I am very clear about my opinion about trendy violent ideologies, and I can get quite angry that most people decide to follow the flock, or a trend, or the politically correct (that is actually harmful) instead of thinking for themselves and find a posture that is really good for society.
‚Ä¢ I sometimes can have quit rages with videogames.
‚Ä¢  When I‚Äôm happy I tend to be very childlike when socializing or playing, and when I‚Äôm pissed off I can be very adult and a bit asshole. That makes me wonder about what my real identity. And I can never find the answer.
‚Äã"
187,isfp,"

I am also a giant fucking douche when I get mad. I purposefully become petty and irrational.


Only video game that has made me rage quit was Persona 4, and it was only once. That game is amazing but it can be a big bag of dicks sometimes.


Couldnt care less about trendy stuff. People are gonna hurt each other no matter what their excuse is. Its just gonna be something new in a month anyway. Just unplug yourself for a month and you'll feel better.


I also have random bouts of intense determination to do things. Usually lasts a month or two at a time, but I don't cheat for a second during that time. Still following my yearly go to the gym resolution.


I'm not judgmental at all. Though first impressions are never erased with me.


Money is a means to an end for me. I couldnt fucking care less what im doing as long as my boss treats me the way I deserve to be treated.


I dont share the ""And then what?"" mindset at all. Im quite content with how things are going.


I miss small details a lot unless its in my room. My roommate has trained me because that son of a bitch will never put something back where he found it.


I just struggle to express myself in general. I dont talk much, and while I find myself to be naturally gifted artistically it doesnt interest me whatsoever.


When I get bored I start breaking things. Nothing important though. I just start acting reckless. I like gambling too.


I get hopelessly lost all the time. In contrast to that I have a shockingly good ability to retrace my steps without fail though.

"
188,isfp,"I too get depressed then I'm bored. I can never just ""relax & do nothing"". Feels like I'm wasting my time.
I'm usually not judgemental, except when I see someone parenting badly. Then it really bothers me, because I feel for the child/children stuck in it.
And I am also childlike when happy, but I can be a real jerk if someone pisses me off.
But I don't share those other traits."

drawings: I stress if I take a lot. I literally suffer if I have to focus on a single drawing for more than a few minutes. 
‚Äã
‚Äã
it should be noted that I'm still not 100% of my type. I'm struggling between ISFP and INFP, so don't worry :)
‚Äã"
191,isfp,"IxTP here. Do you all have the tendency to tease your friends? Im not talking about like toxic mean constant teasing, but like a casual mischievous kind of teasing. (I actually think it's cute so I'm not complaining just curious) My friend does this... although she always follows up with ""just kidding"". I suppose she wants to make sure she doesn't hurt anyone's feelings. The weird thing is, she's friends with me, my sister, and another mutual friend ... and I'm the only one in the group who gets teased. for instance if I stutter while speaking she'll point and laugh. It's quite amusing. She does do this to her brothers though. (She's the youngest and has 2 older brothers).
Tl;Dr: do you tease? If so who and why?"
192,isfp,"I always tease and will say ‚Äòjust kidding‚Äô. But depending on if the person knows me well, I don‚Äôt say it as often. It does annoy me that I say it all the time, so I try not to, but then people end up getting offended. I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF. "
193,isfp,"Cute  haha
It's weird, I have an ISFP friend and she will never leave out the ""just kidding"" either. I barely ever say it because if I like this person it's pretty obvious I am not being serious.
I mean if I say ""you're such a little dumbo"" I expect my highly expressive grin to give it away and I know you are if you suddenly insult me smiling. If people tell me ""just kidding"" I tend to ironically think: ""oh really? Thanks for clearing that up, I thought you hate me now"". I don't know why, but the ""I have to tell you I am kidding or otherwise you won't notice I am joking"" bothers me."
194,isfp,"The characters don't necessarily have to be ISFPs themselves. In fact, a lot of characters people have said I'm like I don't think share my type.
Pearl (Steven Universe)- ISTJ
Fluttershy- ISFP
Pocahontas- ISFP
Princess Aurora/Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty)- INFP
Charlotte La Bouff (The Princess and the Frog)- ESFJ
Sibella (yes, the cute little vampire girl from Scooby Doo)- ISFJ?"
195,isfp,"tibby from the sisterhood of the travelling pants (when I was in 7th grade, my teacher told me this)
some character in a crime drama show who's basically a sarcastic know it all.
my sister compared me to the girl in the book ""white oleander"" once
hermione"
196,isfp,"There are a few subs I like on here, but honestly almost all of them have some annoying stuff so I'm trying to dial down my usage. I like some fashion and music subs, but I spend too much time reading stuff on /r/askmen or r/askreddit. This sub also isn't bad, I check it every so often.
I guess I'm just bored, but I should be using that time for something else because browsing reddit is sort of depressing in a way. "
197,isfp,"Not an ISFP, I‚Äôm a curious ENTJ that enjoys reading this subreddit to gain insight because you folk are my opposite after all. I initially started using reddit for psychology and mental health issues subreddits because I dated a narcissist and wound up in a seriously toxic web of a ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with a sociopath/narcissist couple, and I have a mental illness; so I was originally trying to get insight into all of that... and then I found the mbti subreddits and I was like, ‚ÄúAha, I found my people!‚Äù Lol. "
198,isfp,"I've been hit with the spontaneity stick at 10pm at night. I'm thinking of creating an artwork about being an ISFP, where the artwork/s are never finished. 
Can anyone think of some creative ideas of projects I could start and not finish, leaving the viewer with a feeling of distress and unease knowing that it's unfinished.
Considering like doing a bunch of puzzles and just leaving one piece out, or something like that."
199,isfp,"Leave out some colours. 
Paint like something that draws people attention to a blank space on the page. Like you would paint the holy grail with arms stretching out towards it or something but don‚Äôt paint the object leaving people thinking, dam they didn‚Äôt finish it, I need to know what the object is!
Puzzle idea is good but take out critical parts. 
Half painted bridge.
People without finished faces. I actually like this one especially with a emotional looking scene with people but you can‚Äôt see their emotions without faces!
Regardless of what you do I would love to see the end result!!!"
200,isfp,"Unease: Chess set, with pieces on impossible squares. 
Unfinished: picture of you painting youself painting yourself etc. Each one unfinished. Like yourcwaiting for the down level guy to make a move gor you to copy. Haha"
201,isfp,"
Make a candle but with the wick just under the surface of the wax so you can see but not light it

Write a poem but set one or two lines of rhyme or meter off

202,isfp,"Run their finger across their arm when laying down, stare at the lines on their palms, hold their hand up in the air while laying down, run their finger down their nose while in a fist, touch their ears, stroke their hair, etc? Or something similar to those things? Sensations r cool."
203,isfp,"Yeah. I‚Äôm really good at getting comfortable and sleeping anywhere because I‚Äôve just learned to close my eyes and appreciate how comfortable every limb in my body is against my bed. I‚Äôll be out in minutes lol. Or anytime I‚Äôm focusing on something, I‚Äôll be tracing my jaw bone or poking that vein that pops out in my ankle or brushing through my hair. Sensations r cool!"
204,isfp,"Sensations are cool! This is only kind of related but did anyone ever imagine what swimming in a swimming pool filled with tapioca pudding or jello would be like when they were kids? 
I‚Äôm an adult now and still somewhat intrigued by the idea but when I was a kid and my dad would take me swimming, I used to think about what it might feel like to swim in a swimming pool full of my favorite foods. "
205,isfp,"I‚Äôve had that exact same same tapioca pudding-filled pool fantasy.

When I feel like I'm on an adventure whenever I spend time with them (even if we're just at home watching tv..if I prefer that to being alone, they're a keeper)."
208,isfp,"

Healthy dialogue about everything (no secrets, no blaming, just wanting to solve whatever is bothering someone)


Trust (no need to check phones, where the other person is, etc. If they want to cheat, they will. You need to trust them, otherwise it won't be healthy)


Freedom (related to trust, no forbidding the person from doing anything. If they want to talk to their ex or whatever, forbidding it won't solve it. If you are really upset about something, tell them, and they should understand and keep from upsetting you in the future)


Being reasonable (no 'crazy' demands or being upset over nothing. If I fell asleep and didn't message you, no need to get mad. Creating unreasonable expectations is a sure fire way to mess up any relationship, even a friendship)


Urge to better themselves (in any way they consider important, but specially self-knowledge. Therapy taught me how to deal with my issues so I don't dump them on other people. Similarly, I don't want anyone to dump their problems on me for no reason. Mutual support is great, of course, but often people just get nasty and don't even know why they are doing those things)


Either way, I'm not really looking for a relationship right now. I dated for 5 years, but right now I feel like I'd do better in an open or polyamourous relationship, and not many people are willing to try that out. It really requires a lot more trust and dialogue, and dealing with jealousy (which I hate and honestly can't understand).
And there is no sure way to know they are a keeper, but many ways to know that there are red flags. Don't let being in love blind you, making a relationship healthy is hard work. Good luck!"
209,isfp,"Love is 'irrational' that way. What you think you want in a relationship and like about a person, doesn't matter really. The same qualities in different person might leave you completely unmoved. Somehow your brains just decides ""Yup, I like this one."" and when it does you'll just know it."
210,isfp,"I need a place to vent/rant/let my feelings out, since no one in my family feels like dealing with me. 
I'm a 22 year old female who has come to the conclusion that I'm a weirdo who does not fit in with the rest ofte world. What I mean by this is that my worldview and views on life is different from the views of most people I know. It seems like most people I know want to go to college, have a ""high power"" career, go through a string of shitty relationships before finally settling with ""the one"", and having a cohert of children who they think are ""special"" and ""unique"". Yes, I'd like to go to college, have a job, and perhaps a relationship, but I don't seem to view these things as life goals like how many other people do. I guess I'm just sick of the judgement that people pass on to others who do not share their ""life goals"". 
I can't relate to most of my peers. Anytime I try to connect with them, it goes horribly wrong. I especially cannot relate to my female peers. There, I said it. I can't relate to other females. I don't care if this pisses of feminist; I'm being extremely honest with myself, and what's wrong with being honest? It seems like everyone in my age group is obsessed with makeup, selfies, and pretending to care about social issues in order get attention. Everyone wants to be bubbly and nerdy. I'm just fucking sick of it. I'm sick of people thinking that something is wrong with me because I prefer to be reserved, serious, and entertain myself with my own thoughts.  The physical world does not interest me. The phony front that people put up irritates me. I can see right through it; I want to discover your own thoughts and ideas, not the crap that society feeds you and you regurgitate. 
I feel a disconnect to the ""rituals"" of society. Again, I can see through it, and it angers me that others fall for it. If I try to explain to people why I refuse to participate in this crap, I getting told I'm crazy or that I need to see a psychologist. If I hear some tell me I need to ""live in the moment"" one more time, I think I'm going to rip my hair out. What is ""the moment"" anyways? 
I hate who I am. I hate that I'm not ""normal"", or that I just don't understand things that a huge hunk of society values. I don't know what job or career to pursue, and I don't know what to major in in college. I've thought about major in art history, English, and more recently political science, but those topics are considered ""impractical"". The problem I'm having is that the only thing that really interest me is researching topics and theories, and writing about them, and I don't know what profession that would translate to. 
I'm just really pissed of at myself and the world. I feel like we could all achieve great things, but for whatever reason we don't. Rant/vent over. Thank you to whoever has the patience to read this tripe. "
211,isfp,"Ah, i see that fire in midst of this wall of text. I was once like yourself, so passionate about not fitting in, about issues this and that. But my dear, you deserve rest really. There's no point in telling the sun to not shine so brightly, you are who you are, they are who they are. Let them be and most importantly, let you be. Rest now."
212,isfp,"I do, too. Unfortunately, this doesn't help us very much in the social world.
Brilliant point there.
You don't seem weird to me at all. In fact, nothing in here isn't completely reasonable and understandable. I get your frustration. Don't hate yourself! I know it's hard when everyone around you seems not to be able to understand, but be proud that you can see through the fakeness, and that you can have thoughts and dreams uninfluenced by what society pushes onto you. People your age probably have no idea who they are and are doing whatever to fit in. Yes, it's annoying. But try to give them the benefit of the doubt.
I encourage you to study what you are interested in, even if it's ""impractical"". If you're worried about financial stability, well...I'm not really sure myself. I just think it would be so not worth it to go to university and study something you're not interested in just so you can get a job easily. "
213,isfp,"As you get older you will give less of a fuck what people think of you, trust me. Just be yourself and find people to connect with who appreciate you for who you are. I know it's easier said than done, but that's the best way to improve your happiness and well-being. "
214,isfp,"I don't think I fit in either, but fitting in and being normal isn't what makes someone happy.
Being normal is boring! Basic people with their boring outfits and boring problems and unimaginative lifestyles. You don't need to fit into that.
Lots of people study things in school that are considered impractical, but if you're even a little clever, you'll still end up with a career. (Researching topics and theories, by the way, sounds like you'd enjoy a degree in public policy maybe?)
It's okay to see a psychologist. They're there to help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is proven to be super effective in peer-reviewed studies. Just know that you're gonna be fine."
215,isfp,"I just find it so difficult to put up a smiley, bubbly, happy-go-lucky front in public. I guess I'm sick of people thinking something is wrong with me because I don't show a lot of facial expressions, and I'm not easily exicted; I'm sick of being preceived as a ""bitch"" by others. "
216,isfp,I recently found out I‚Äôm ISFP/ISFT‚Äî are sunsets something ISFPs particularly enjoy? Because I‚Äôve always been extremely attracted to them and a hobby of mine would be to find new beaches and parks in my area to watch sunsets from. Huh.
217,isfp,well yeah sure lol but if that were the case there wouldn‚Äôt really be a reason to post it to this sub. like I said I don‚Äôt know much about ISFPs so I don‚Äôt know if sunsets are like ~a thing~ or something lol
218,isfp,"You finish a work of art, only to obsess over one small detail that isn't right. You go back and fix that one detail. But even after it's fixed, you can't stop obsessing over it, feeling that it still isn't right."
219,isfp,"I definitely connect with this. 
I remember when I finished something and posted it online a few months ago. A day later I went back and fixed a small detail, then worked on the same detail again a bit later. I still wasn't completely satisfied with it even after that, but I've gotten used to sort of leaving things a bit unfinished, or imperfect to me"
220,isfp,"to really and truly love is more important than to be loved
the problem is most people settle for the idea or spectre of love and never really truly love another person in such a way that it sustains itself, and is happy to do so, without return
it seems to me a lot of people love on condition of concurring love; they meet eachother halfway, and what they find loveable is that thing that loves them in return.  to me I may seem demanding because I want to admire a person independent of how they feel about me, because to condition it in such a way seems unnatural.  I want to love them for who they are and if that includes loving me back so be it.  in that sense, my love is ""demanding"" because it presumes to judge whether or not a person is worthy aside from the fact that we're both ""trying in a relationship""--rather it centers on only my feelings towards them apart from such commitments or effort.  its self centered in its own way, but when you find such a love it is unbreakable because it doesn't ask anything in return except the other person be themselves
in general what passes for love these days is a mutual commitment of both parties to not be themselves for the sake of the other.  I reject that, because that love is fundamentally a sleight of hand as far as I can tell. it cannot sustain itself except in the presence of the other and has no permanent basis.  the truest love in my mind is that which stands absolute, but such a love requires that person be, in their core, someone who elicits such a feeling and that is a very high barrier, whereas the love that requires only mutual commitment could basically be fulfilled by anyone"
221,isfp,"I'm pretty simple/straightforward when it comes to what I expect. i dislike huge dramatic displays of affection, especially in public/around other people. People who make out in public are like... idk. Like no one wants to see that. 
obviously i want the person to respect me and be loyal and have my back. but i don't need to be worshiped. i'm pretty down to earth."
222,isfp,"I want to be super cherished, pampered. 
""Picky when receiving love?""
What you mean? Lol.
I mean all I want is to be prioritized as the most important person/thing.  I want them to show this by always being on my side no matter what. 
Because  isn't that the whole point of being someone's lover/So? 
It's probably what most Feeler's  wants in an monogamous relationship too lol. "
223,isfp,I want to be super pampered and cherished. Does that make me picky? Deeper emotional needs? I guess other people don't want to be cherished? haha :) the problem with this is comparing. It's really not relevant because each person has various needs. How can you say do you have too much need? A need is a need. Are some people more needy? Do you have deeper sexual needs? hehe financial needs? I think it probably varies with everyone. I shy away from too much or too little. I've had people say I'm too loud and others say I'm too quiet. :) I just gotta be me!
224,isfp,"Everyone has deeper emotional needs. And yes, this particular isfp loves to be pampered :) I want someone who admires, respects, and understands me very well (more than I understand myself?). Obviously they have to be very attracted to me as well. I'm really picky. I want someone who can talk to me without awkwardness and someone who is my kindred spirit. I want someone who makes me want to become a better person for them."
225,isfp,"Thank you for such a beautiful answer!
Does it really not matter though that your admiration and love for someone, the way you are lifting them on a pedestal, is unilateral? Is there not in the slightest a wish to be valued and admired who you are?"
226,isfp,"That is a nice reply btw :) especially the ""not being worshipped"" part. 
I think i struggled to come up with this explanation when i asked the question in the first place.
Soi basically to a certain extent you are prone to make others happy more than they make you happy, even though the share you may receive could be smaller? "
227,isfp,"Yes, picky :)))) as in you want a certain intensity that is a tad maybe too intense for others? :) 
I ll give an example: I am a Feeler and being the idealistic perfectionist that I am, in the matter of emotions and feelings and pampering i am aware that the intensity I desire could be considered too intense by others. (me not caring about what others think is not relevant here :) ) "
228,isfp,"If you want to be super pampered, then I would say yes, it is a form of pickiness :)))) While im not comparing with others (except for stories around me of colleagues, friends etc.), I am aware that the intensity I seek makes me a deeper feeler and maybe even a deeper need...er ahahah "
229,isfp,"there's a huge wish for that the case, but a refusal to force it
for me, force is starting to become implied when a mutual commitment is precondition to love; so even though one  really wants that reciprocal value and admiration, one can't promote a dynamic where one pressures someone to be something other than that what they truly are, even in the name of love, which basically leaves one only with ""pure"" unilateral love and the rest just has to fall where it may.  but when it does, and if it does, then its true and pure
in other words, it just has to arise and flow naturally, free from influence both positive and negative (i.e.: free from things that would ""support"" love because that ""support"" actually makes it something less than perfectly natural).  love in some sense must be one sided for it to be worth holding onto.  i think so many people get this bilateral version of love then wonder why since they got what they want its not really what they want and its because the bilateral version is unnatural in the sense that its artificially built up but in having done so it lost its spark.  it diminishes the thing the person is looking for in the getting of it, if you go about it that way (or if I did, I can only speak for myself).  its why beauty is so important because its just this natural force, outside of that artificial dynamic, that speaks for itself, but viewed from the outside also seems shallow, but its not shallow its just honest
love in the sense i'm describing seems really irrational but its not irrational so much as its Fi, not Ti. its more obvious when you see a Fi dom go on and on about their object of affection and no one gets it, but its precisely because there's nothing ""to get"" that makes it so strong and natural
Fe + Ti could provide lots of reasons because of objective feeling and Ti structure giving form to the relation in such a way that if you asked it would make a lot of sense, where Fi does have this disconnected, absolute, unreasoning quality to it, but that is precisely its strength, and only a weakness or ""delusional"" from the point of view of differing base values
A lot of it is is because Fi is ""energy"" itself--it doesn't need outside reasons to sustain itself, it sustains itself perfectly well by itself as long as it is ""true"" or ""authentic""
bilateral love is love ""in the air"" between two people i.e.: Fe, and is its own source of energy, but its derived from people ""trying"" intentionally in the case of two Fe valuers.  In the case of Fi it is just a byproduct of their Fi attitudes towards one another when they're in alignment without actually trying to be.  when people rely on the Fe energy to sustain them they can be said to value Fe and then use Ti/Fe ways of supporting such energy by way of purposefully and intentionally promoting it.  But Fi comes from within and doesn't rely on reciprocal energy for that reason; for that same reason Fe methods of sustaining a relationship seem ""artificial"" from the point of view of Fi"
230,isfp,"Your explanation makes me understand why an ISFP I know lead an absolutely miserable life until now. He was married to someone, something that now I understand, was in fact unilateral love, or mismatching definitions of love. (I think the other partner is actually a narcissist).
He is exactly how you describe Fi, like an inner natural source of affection and he would have done (and did) everything for the other partner, who actually was taking it all selfishly, and for granted. The ISFP never got the appreciation or the value that, as you said, was desired and longed for and somehow my gut feeling is telling me, that he was somehow taking it for granted that it is a given that he will be appreciated for what he brings to the table. Somewhere down the road, he realised that there is no way this will happen, it was never the case in the past, nor now. Appreciation was never requested, but only innerly desired, never voiced out. The ISFP was rather used for personal purposes and self-gratification, and was inflicted with all the insecurities felt by the other. As the other did not learn what self-love means, they were constantly mirroring their own unsatisfied needs upon the ISFP, who of course, always selflessly going beyond their own limits, give ad eternum. 
The other one had personal inner insecurities that they themselves did not address and to compensate their own unresolved individual insecurities, was needingly and constantly making the ISFP fix something which was not for them to fix in the first place.
Example: the other partner does to like how they look in the mirror. The moment this person misinterpreted in any way the signs or behaviors of the ISFP as non appreciation, they were engaging in a fight as to question the love of the ISFP towards them.
The way I see it, that Fi could be a source of unhappiness as well, for the ISFP. At the end of the day, in non mutual relationships like that, ISFPs would be utterly crushed as you guys are human too.
From an outsider like me, it is extremley painful witnessing that people with such pure emotions as ISFPs , if in a relationship with abusive and/or narcissist partners, enter a loop of unhappiness which most the time can last a lifetime (thanks as well to your intense agony for conflicts, hence breaking up is dreaded by you, and if occurs means that the very last chords of patience of the ISFP were broken). And this is huge, as I have never met anyone as patient as an ISFP. 
That being said, if in partnership with abusive partners, ISFPs sentence themselves to a slow but certain misery, after years of non reciprocated, undervalued affection.
Plus, ISFPs being the kind hearted and voided of storng personal boundaries struggle to say ""no"" and hence will have an extremely difficult time in stopping the never ending giving to the abusive partner. 
While I understand the natural Fi and how it originates from personal inner core, this is one more confirmation how harmful it can become for the ISFP on the long run.
Being happy with minimal appreciation is alright with you, but is this really emotionally healthy for you on the long run?
While I admire your Fi, it is painful to watch from the outside.
Again, thank you for your great insights It clarified so many things."
231,isfp,"for me, being happy with minimal appreciation is like the definition of emotional health.  its basically being free from contingency on how other people view me, even people I love.  ""love"" in that sense is ""freed"" from the co dependence on good feeling originating in the other person, which I view as ""unhealthy"" from my point of view.  however I understand that were the perspective flipped the inverse would look just as unhealthy, as you described
its hard to express exactly why it feels that way but it goes to the inner font of feeling that is so subjective to the extent that it devalued the object but in such a way that your sense of pity has no real place because enhanced subjectivity does not feel the pain the way you would would you insert yourself into the same or similar circumstances... Jung's chapter on the introverted feeling type goes into this in Psychological Types
obviously when it crosses over into outright abuse it is something else entirely and no longer within the realm of differing perspectives or whatever.  introverted feeling types might invite weaker people to try their hand at abusing the other's love but Fi dynamics are not itself unhealthy, rather it seems that anyone can be selfish and take advantage of the ""freedom"" Fi dynamics offer, but the real secret is: to do so you are not ""winning"" but only harming yourself such that Fi is not really an invitation to abuse but to be truly healthy and that the Fi type is simply trying to live out that example and invitation"
232,isfp,"Everything I listed above and more. I love it when the other just gets me and I get them. Physical attraction is important and so is intelligence. My sister said I like adventurous nerds. Personality and kindness is important. I don't like awful people. I can be pretty mean though haha. I have a bad temper too... so I hope my SO will be able to handle that. Basically I want an extroverted, squishy, kind, and adventurous nerd who can handle my childishness. I don't mind if he is childish himself (I find that cute). I just hope he is more mature than me in some ways. Like most girls, I want him to have his shit together. I'm not looking for a 6-figure income though. I'm not that great myself so I imagine I'll have trouble finding someone like that. I tend to push guys I like away because I have low self esteem but high standards... "
233,isfp,"Sorry if this has been asked already. I am feeling very lazy watching tv all day and sitting on my phone when I'm not at work. I used to read constantly when I was a kid. I loved fantasy or just anything really unusual (magical realism). 
A favorite author of mine is Haruki Murakami cuz his stuff is just really weird and feels like a dream. But at the same time the way he writes is so beautiful and real like you can see everything he describes perfectly."
234,isfp,"I also love Murakami. Hard-boiled Wonderland was fantastic and I'm currently reading Wind-up Bird Chronicle. 
As for recommendations I'd say Vonnegut is within the same vein and is also one of my favourites. Maybe Kafka- though I havent read as much  "
235,isfp,I always recommend the Wheel of Time. Its an Epic Fantasy and every book was a NYTimes Best seller. The only downside for most people is that its 14 books long and all the books are rather large. However I've read them 3 or 4 times through. 
236,isfp,"People always tell me I‚Äôm an extremely likable person, but yet I‚Äôve always had trouble romantically.  In past relationships I‚Äôve been told that I seem too uninterested and that I don‚Äôt put enough ‚Äúwork‚Äù into things such as making plans.  Also, people have taken offense from me wanting to be alone sometimes, but that‚Äôs just an integral part of who I am.
It just seems like my personality is not the best for long-term relationships.  Making friends is very easy, but anything more is extremely difficult.
Can anyone else relate to this or perhaps share some advice?"
237,isfp,"I relate to this so much! Especially past me.
I now have a long term partner and i felt a connection as soon as we met. I enjoy alone time and sometimes my friends don‚Äôt understand why i don‚Äôt wanna hang out because i‚Äôm recharging. Now i live with my partner and get bored and lonely when she‚Äôs not around. Which took some getting used to for me because i always liked alone time ahaha. 
We‚Äôre both extremely introverted (she‚Äôs an INTP) we need time to recharge when we‚Äôve been around our friends, but now we recharge together. We found that as soon as we met we both wanted to spend absolutely every single minute of the day together. I‚Äôve never felt this sort of connection with anyone, because i am an extremely independent person. 
I think we‚Äôve just got to connect with the right person, as soon as you find someone you connect so strongly with, it‚Äôll all work out in the end! I found myself wanting to plan to do things and get out to spend as much time with her as possible. 
Good luck! You‚Äôre doing fine, keep being yourself!  :) "
238,isfp,"I can relate and often think the same thing. I enjoy the company of others, but I usually will hit a limit and need some 'me' time. It makes it difficult to invest the unwanted time into another person. Although, socially speaking, it would be nice to connect with someone on a higher level. I don't have advice other than what one of my favorite people would say ""I like you as you are"" - Fred Rogers."
239,isfp,"I get along with most people, but, romantically, can only recall 1 time where I deeply connected with someone. I'm single now, and although I have opttions where I could date - I just don't connect enough to where it's more than just friendship or whatever. Frustrating at times, and I am in awe of how people can just so easily get into romantic relationships so easily. "
240,isfp,"My wife is also an INTP and this has definitely been my experience, too. It's awesome to just hang out with her, it's way less stressful than being around anybody else and we both just enjoy being near each other.
I sometimes tune out when she rambles about space or whatever, though "
241,isfp,"Nope, not uninterested on purpose.  I‚Äôll admit that sometimes my attention is elsewhere, but I really can‚Äôt help it and never intend to give that vibe to the other person.
And I‚Äôm male actually, I‚Äôve had this problem with the girls I‚Äôve dated in the past."
242,isfp,"Nice!
Haha, sometimes i tune out when my partners talking to me about something and randomly tune back in halfway through the chat and she‚Äôs like, yeah? You listening? and i‚Äôm like lol whut? I was elsewhere, she doesn‚Äôt get annoyed at me though, she thinks it‚Äôs cute :) "
243,isfp,"Thanks! We met at university through a mutual friend. We were both doing English courses and actually only properly got to know each other in our last year. It was insane how well we just clicked and felt comfortable with each other, we were friends for a while and just sort of fell in love with each other. Thanks for asking! :) "
244,isfp,"We didn‚Äôt really know each other that well before final year. I always thought she was attractive and wanted to get to know her more but i was shy and didn‚Äôt know how to approach her, but i always knew she was special. She was friends with my friend so i knew things about her but we only really said hi and stuff in passing when we saw each other. I think we were both really awkward and shy, she‚Äôs told me she always found me attractive and was too afraid to talk to me for ages because i intimidated her haha. 
In final year we started hanging out with each other because we all had a lot of work to do and we kept doing work and hanging out together in the library with our mutual friend. We just became more comfortable with each other and started to get to know each other more and the chemistry became even stronger :) "
245,isfp,Had to Google Paul Lehr.  He's wonderful!  Maybe some day I'll build upon my own... One never knows what road creativity will lead you down.  And thank you for your kind words.  I love that that's what you see üôè
246,isfp,"Definitely learn to get out of your comfort zone!  Even if it‚Äôs just by a fraction each time, you‚Äôre building a foundation, and when you look back over time, you‚Äôll see great improvement.  
I work in a very ‚ÄúType A‚Äù personality job, and as an ISFP, I don‚Äôt consider myself a type A or B person. It‚Äôs been a challenge dealing with the anxiety that can come from new situations, but as I‚Äôve challenged myself, and also often not having a choice with my job but to deal with things I don‚Äôt want to, I‚Äôve grown immensely."
247,isfp,Taking up uber driving has been amazing for my social skills. I've learned how to chat to all different kinds of people. It's also helped me get to know my city and is really fun cruising around all day. Every day is an adventure to somewhere new. So I guess my advice is choose a job/hobby which is going to challenge you while suiting your needs as an isfp.
248,isfp,"ENFP here. I have developed a relationship with an ISFP. Its like a cross between a great friendship and a mutual infatuation with one another. This all happened over the span of 6 months. We both fell fast and hard. We aren't dating, have drunkenly made out a few times, and have had huge important/intense moments with each other. 
I don't know what to call us, but being in love without the label of together and admitting it to one another, feels accurate. 
Anyhow, she often comes to me with deep information about herself and her worries for her own well being that I know she doesn't share with anyone else. I just want to know the best way for me to let her know I care and love her. 
I don't want to come across as overbearing or annoying and preachy. 
What is the best way to show an ISFP that you genuinely care? I'm also working on being more blunt with her about how I feel.
Thanks!"
249,isfp,"What is the best way to show me you genuinely care?
When someone does something for me and still respects my values I feel deaply respected and loved. I don't want someone to tell me they love me, I want them to show me (and tell me :p).
Defending my honor without making me appear weak is a big one. Or doing something for me which I couldn't get myself to do is another.
For example I am a typical lazy procrastinator and I play piano, so cleaning my piano for me would be a great show of love. It's not that I want someone to fix my life, but I need help cleaning it up literally and figuratively."
250,isfp,"WHen it comes to ISFPs, actions speak louder than words. For me, it's the little things people do like making time for me even when they are busy, or surprising me with flowers/food/a note/etc when I'm having a bad day. "
251,isfp,"Most likely this is the case. I have a super hard time expressing my feelings openly. Just because that feels so pushy and uncomfortable for me. Also if my feelings aren't met on the opposing side, it just crushes me emotionally for a few days, if not weeks."
252,isfp,"Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities

Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.
Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.
Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.
Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.

Ni/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:

Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.
Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.

Therefore:

Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.
Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.
Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in the current context.
Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.

254,isfp,"What gender is everyone in here? I feel like most ISFP references I've seen just doing general research and surfing around the MBTI subreddits are pertaining to women more than men. 
Also, I'm new here, so as a bit of an introduction, I'm from the East Coast, USA. I'm a 16 year old ISFP guy who's interested in self improvement and meeting others of the same type to compare notes about our weird inner worlds, both as introverts and ISFPs. :)"
255,isfp,"This is something I notice a lot in Fe users, and it irritates me to no end. The endless will and need to be accepted (usually conforming to mindless trends, pop culture and behavior), and to accomplish something or contribute to society. These people always blame themselves whenever something is wrong, and they always do what others want. I mean, to a certain degree you should be polite and conform, but you really shouldn't give up being yourself for the masses needs, imo. And I really think that actually wanting to contribute to society is weird. I can't really comprehend wanting to do work outside of getting money, it seems like some sort of (excuse the tinfoil hat talk) manipulation done by the powers that be. 
Overall, sure. I think we should all just conform a little, be polite to each other, work is essential to life, but... I really can't comprehend it controlling your life so much outside of your obligations. 
What's your opinion on this?"
256,isfp,"Contributing to society isn't neccessarily tied conformity. I'm always acutely aware of how much I need other humans, and so I try to do my part. For me that doesn't mean fitting in, but to try and be decent, clean up my own messes, and leave things in as good a condition or better than how I found them. And more specifically, it means taking care of the people who sacrificed a lot to raise and take care of me.
Have you heard of feral children? Kids who are raised with minimal human contact, some literally by wolves. After a certain age, it becomes impossible for the to learn languages. So they never adapt, and are never able to reintegrate as humans. They probably don't feel like they're missing out so they're fine. But when I think about things like language, music, food...it's beautiful and I want to participate in it, whether or not I will be accepted. In these sparkling aspects of civilisation.
Sometimes I wonder about the invention of bread. Who was the genius caveman who thought it up? ""Like ah, let me spend the afternoon grinding up these seeds, just because. Maybe I'll add some water and make some goop. Now I'll make it into a ball and put it in the fire!"" Like, that kind of thought process doesn't make sense coming from a single person. No, I think it must've been something discovered over the course of time, and the trial and error of many people. Now we've got all manner of cakes and pastries, and quite honestly it's like magic. It's only possible as the result of thousands of years of collective wisdom and experimentation. Human civilisation! We are pretty shitty, but we do some wonderful things, too."
257,isfp,"I don't think it's an Fe thing exclusively. Fe is ethical, and Fi is moral. Being a ""people pleaser"" can have different roots if that makes sense.
Maybe you do it because it's the right thing to do, maybe you do it because social pressure."
258,isfp,"I think you're talking about two separate things there. Are you a young adult who's anxious about entering the workforce by any chance? Work can only erode your sense of self as much as you let it. Those people you're talking about just so happen to thrive in the terrarium of most work environments; that's who they are too.

I don't think ISFPs are particularly well suited to many business arenas. But we do what we must, I guess. What else can we do?"
259,isfp,"Yeah but have you heard about the man that was raised by wolves for 15 years, then was ""rescued"" by hunters and taught the language, and said he was happier back when he was in the wolf pack? Hm yeah didn't think so!"
260,isfp,"This will be so ENFP of me, but I have been trying to type my crush for about six months and I'm quite unable to - mostly because he's two different people onstage and offstage.
Before anything else - he is not necessarily a celebrity, most people don't know him by name and we know each other.
Some starting points that contradict one another


He's an incredible performer, a show-off.


He's a multinstrumentalist. Can play basically anything.


He's a great singer.


He's a pretty straightforward lyricist - all stuff love-related, simple, if not shallow. Naive-ish.


He's very physical towards me, the first man I didn't hit when he touched me randomly. Hugs me tightly, kisses me.


He is not necessarily physical with most other people.


He is not a drug user, rarely ever drinks a full can or bottle of beer and I saw him smoke two cigarettes in an occasion where he was super-nervous.


He is quite a dresser. Like, I don't know that much about clothes and shoes and I'm a woman.


He's very cerebral - has two university degrees in seemingly unrelated fields. HOWEVER, one of those two was what his parents wanted from him, his mother's profession.


He's been quite persistent about one of his projects, which people pretty much discredited at first.


He's approachable and kind to everybody, but he never posted anything personal on Facebook, rarely ever reveals something that's not professional. I was surprised when I went to see if he was okay after a show where he had voice problems and he revealed that he needs a vacation and is taking a random one, in a quiet village.


When we reunited after a long time I spent thinking he did something he never did (his friend insulted me, not him...), he was somewhat guarded before I apologised, but even then he was nice. The moment I said I was sorry, I could literally feel his guard drop.


He has long-term future plans. I, err, have none.


He has an adopted child, which is a very, very rare thing here.


He talks a lot and knows a lot about many things - both music-wise and otherwise. His vocabulary is great.


He doesn't force his opinion on people


His expressions often don't match what he's doing or saying - e.g. he'd be happy to see me and have a resting bitch face. He'd suddenly go all awkward during a live show while somebody else is talking and look down, giggling.


In all groups of people, the one who dominates the conversation and talks most.


Sometimes he has these power trips going on and it comes across when he assures people that everybody in the band is an equal and then talks about how he wanted to have creative control over everything.


There is literally no dirt about him - another reason I'm surprised so as to why he is seemingly returning my affections. That makes me wonder where his Fi is.


Huge eater. Doesn't really have a refined taste.


A hard worker, dedicated. Has family, currently the only breadwinner.


For those who believe this is related: stocky build, round face, large eyes, weight going up and down, but nothing that could be seen as thin or overweight at any point. High kinesthetic intelligence, ambidextrous. Delicate and gentle mannerisms when not in-character and/or onstage.


Thanks in advance. :)"
261,isfp,"Stoping looking at the surface, MBTI isn‚Äôt about behavior, but cognition.

262,isfp,I have been studying cognitive functions for more than three years now and the descriptions were just random facts I threw around. I guess that I am just not good at being objective when it comes to somebody I like.
263,isfp,"I struggle to find Fe there, but in general, I'm a Fi user and pretty stupid when it comes to extraverted feeling. I'm pretty stupid when it comes to Ni, too.

You could argue that EPs also like to dominate social situations, but he seems far too deliberate with his actions (everything he says and does serves a specific purpose), is very conscientious, and even controlling. Almost rules out any kind of P.

267,isfp,I was looking for a new desktop photo when I accidentally clicked this. I liked how the photo of the Straw Hat Pirates was centered and was seen only once. It's really nice.
268,isfp,"Are there any other athletes here besides myself? What sports do you play? What level do you compete at? Why do you play?
I played travel hockey up through high school (A / AA) and as well as rec baseball. I moved out of state right before my sophomore year of high school, but the rink was a home away from home and didn't make a ton of friends at school because I usually kept to myself. Being on the ice and making the same personal investment as the other 16 guys on our team did a lot for me. It was a second family /sports cliche."
269,isfp,"I played soccer and ran both indoor and outdoor track all the way up through high school. I also got into cycling around my sophomore or junior year of high school, and now in my 4th in college, cycling is about the only sport I've done for fun or competitively for the last 4 years. 
Aside from really enjoying any sports I've done, I guess what made me enjoy them the most was the friends I've made doing them. I've never really had a wide circle of friends but almost all of the friends I've made have been from doing the same sports together."
270,isfp,"I ran cross country in 7th grade. I was horrible at it and didn't have any fun at all. Last year I really got into running. Started out doing it consistently despite having times worse than my 7th grade experience. After a couple months I went from not even being able to run 3 miles straight, to going 7 miles (still with a lot of effort). I then decided that I was really going to push myself outside of my comfort zone and sign up for a full marathon on my 17th birthday. I just kept pushing myself even when I got stuck at doing 12 miles. By my 11th month, I went from couch to 26.2 miles, finishing with a time of 3:56:06. It was the most fun, rewarding, boring, and massively brutal experiences of my life.
I am currently training for 2 marathons this year. I want to try to get a 3:00:00 to qualify for Boston this September, and hopefully go run that race my senior year.
I love running. It's a great sport for me because it's incredibly introverted as I am only trying to better myself and I am left in my own world. I also find many aspects of running to be a great allegory to us as humans ourselves: it's up to you to choose the path you'll run. Will you explore, or will you take the path most traveled by? Do you choose to give up when it gets tough, or do you stick through the pain? Do you force yourself to go the hard route because you know it'll make you better in the end, or do you stay at home, or just make the run easy? It's in those primal moments of my feet effortlessly gliding across the pavement that I slip away from my problems and float away.
Or I hate my life because my run is that horrible."
271,isfp,"I play tennis at the high school varsity level. I play because of the relative isolation, outside activity, and the lax stress I recieve from my coach. Also it encourages me to work my interpersonal skills."
272,isfp,"I ran xc and track in high school. I loved the competitiveness of running, especially track, there's just something exciting about lining up on the line while the race director counts up the runners in your race. Your heart is pounding, you're thinking about inspirational quotes in your head, you think to yourself, ""I'm READY! Shoot the damn gun already!"".. and then you hear, ""runners, on your mark.."" and everything becomes silent. Time slows down and you're now completely immersed in the moment, and then.. BAM! You start the race and give it your ALL and try and beat everyone on the track.
But yeah, I started running because a friend of mine wanted me to run a 5k with him about six years ago, and I'd always been a huge road cyclist so I thought what the hell, I'll give it a shot and I got first in my age group and that's how I fell in love with running."
273,isfp,"I've been playing sports ever since I can remember, with basketball being my forte, even though I enjoy partaking in a lot of other sports, such as tennis, soccer, volleyball, and roller hockey. And even though I think football doesn't even deserve the privilege of being referred to as a sport, I enjoy playing it.
I am extremely good at basketball, not to toot my own horn ( I'm usually very modest). I was the only freshman in my year to make the girls varsity team in high school. "
274,isfp,"Sports has been a part of my life, whether watching or playing. When I was young, I played golf and watched football. Nowadays, I still watch football, but now I'm really into watching and playing tennis. A friend taught me how to play in high school and the addiction started there. I made varsity the year after, then when I went to community college, I played one season there. I got burnt out after that, playing nonstop since high school, but picked it up again once I transferred into a university."
275,isfp,"I score IxFP and want to see more of the ISFP side of things. I'm leading Fi 100%. Researched cognitive functions, but curious on real world examples of middle ISFP functions. Maybe others are curious about ISFP vs INFP as well:
1) Are you prone to spilling food or are you generally on top of your body and surroundings? I'm accidentally sloppy. I've spilled some ramen in my time. 
2) I go for a run when anxious/upset. Is that common for you? I used to shoot hoops for hours when upset too. I wasn't WMBA awesome, but something about action gives me clarity. 
3) I fell away from sports when I didn't make team cuts. Lost love for sports even. Inferior Te at its finest. Have you experienced this? 
4) How into writing are you? 
5) How into books and reading are you? Favorite genre?
6) Do you ask what if questions when hyper? How do you act when hyper?
7) Sometimes I wear makeup, but only to reflect some emotion inside, like power. Does that seem familiar?
8) I hate when ppl move stuff around on me (pots, pans, etc) Do you? (Can't tell if this is parental Se, or shadow Se)
9) Is it painful to leave the house when you feel uncomfortable with how you look (without showering, messy hair"" etc)?
10) Are you meticulous with anything?
11) Do you rewatch films multiple times or seek out new ones? Which do you prefer? 
12) How do you know you're not an INFP?
13) How does your Ni manifest?  And Se?
14)  Anyone in fiction (books/shows/movies) that reminds you of yourself? 
15) What are you confident about? 
16) How do you feel about manual labor? 
17)  What annoyed you in school? What did you love about it?
18) Are most of your daydreams attainable? 
19) Does your Ni make you feel like things will work out? Or do you need evidence for that?
20) Do you feel like a ""good"" person or more gray? 
21) How impatient are you with things that don't apply to you?
Thank you! Whatever you can answer helps. "
276,isfp,"

No. I mean, I‚Äôve spilled stuff on occasion, but I‚Äôm generally pretty aware of my surroundings. I sometimes am baffled by other people when they seem to have no perception of theirs.


I don‚Äôt run, but I should. Instead, I self-medicate with drugs. I don‚Äôt often get upset per se, but I do feel like I have a big fucking hole in my soul.


Never cared for team sports at all, not even watching them on TV, I‚Äôm not very competitive. I was super into skateboarding for a long time though, which is more about competing with yourself I guess.


Don‚Äôt like writing really, I‚Äôm more into making visual arts and music.


I like books, but I love movies; comedy, mystery, sci-fi, horror, adventure


I‚Äôm extremely mellow, don‚Äôt really get hyper. At most, I might do something goofy or babble some nonsense when I‚Äôm feeling full of myself.


I‚Äôm a guy so I don‚Äôt wear makeup. 


Hm.. I dunno, never thought about it so I guess it doesn‚Äôt bother me.


It‚Äôs painful to leave the house in general cuz I just hate leaving the house but not because of my appearance. I have messy dreadlocks, only shower a couple times a week, and wear the same dirty pants for days at a time so I always look disheveled anyway and I don‚Äôt really care. I actually am not usually a smelly person believe it or not, but when I do start getting smelly that‚Äôs when I can become self-conscious.


My work. I can be a perfectionist when it comes to my creative projects. I mix concerts and records for a living and I‚Äôm always making the tiniest adjustments, trying to squeeze every last drop of awesome out of every song/show I mix. Nothing fills the hole in my soul like when the mix is perfect and the band is feelin it and the crowd is going nuts.


I love getting/watching new films, I got upwards of 800 films in my collection (which I am also meticulous about organizing) There also are some films I have rewatched many many many times.


I don‚Äôt know for sure but tests have given me ISFP and when I read descriptions of the types I feel pretty textbook ISFP, also my wife agrees. The only other type I might have some traits of is ISTP.


I don‚Äôt know, I haven‚Äôt really educated myself about the functions.


No one comes to mind at the moment


It took a long time, but I‚Äôve become confident in my work. I‚Äôve had enough success that I know I can consistently produce at least ‚Äògood‚Äô sounding mixes. I‚Äôm not super confident in general though.


I like getting the exercise when I have to load equipment, but I have minor back problems so it can get hard on me. I prefer sitting behind my mixing board.


I hated homework the most I guess. And writing like research papers and shit. It wasn‚Äôt too bad tho, I was lucky enough to get good grades without having to study. Art and science were always my favorite classes.


Sometimes I daydream about having a normal, secure, 9-5 desk job, but I know that if I actually had that I would fucking hate it. Related to that, my daydreams often also include having a lot of money, which is something I have mostly accepted will probably never happen as long as I keep doing what I‚Äôm doing. (Unless I get really lucky) 


Like I said, don‚Äôt know much about the functions, but I guess I feel like things will work out. I stress about my future often, but I just go with the flow. 


I think I‚Äôm a decent person. But I‚Äôm quiet and I think I look mean when I‚Äôm concentrating/thinking so people might misjudge me sometimes.


I might be more patient with things that don‚Äôt apply to me than things that do.

"
277,isfp,"I have read the INFP and feel like it doesnt apply to me at all.  I'm not altruistic, I'm not good all the time... in fact, I feel like I'm much more prone to selfishness.    I really dont feel like there is a lot in common with the INFP vs. ISFP... yes, I know they share a lot of letters, but in the descriptions, not so much. "
278,isfp,"lol this reminded me of one of those myspace surveys

I spill and drop everything.
Exercising wouldn't help me if I'm upset.
I've never played a sport. Never wanted to.
I'm very into writing.
I love reading, but I've been in a reading slump for a long time now.
I act...hyper when hyper. I ask ""what if"" questions when I'm upset.
I wear makeup because I enjoy putting it on and it makes me look better. Tho I guess what kind of makeup look I do depends on my mood, look I'm going for, etc.
I hate when people move stuff around for me if I confuses me.
I leave the house looking like shit all the time. It's my ""look"" now.
I'm only meticulous if I care about what I'm doing.
Depends on my mood. I do like to re-watch stuff tho.
I don't really match the description of an INFP.
No clue lol
Nope
I'm only confident when I know what I'm doing.
I hate manual labor. I am a weakling.
I hated everything about school lol
Yep. Most of my day dreams are set in reality.
I don't think about the distant future too much, so idk.
I'm a good person overall.
I'm very impatient lol
"
279,isfp,"I'm an ISFP.

Not really, except when I'm stressed out. I become super clumsy when I'm on edge, but I guess it's a normal human thing rather than a function thing.
I go for a walk when I'm extremely stressed out, or I do watercolor after watercolor. I have to engage my physical senses in something, even if it means hitting the desk or breaking things. But walking usually gets me to feel better.
I don't like sports, so, can't say. But I have the same kind of issue. If I can't succeed on the first time, I tend to give up and get depressed.
I'd love to make writing a living. I often write, whether it's my novel, short stories, or in my diary.
I used to read a lot as a kid, but now I don't have the time and energy anymore to do so like I used to. But my favourite genre is coming-of-age stories.
When hyper, I make a ton of plans that I regret several minutes later, I tend to fidget an extreme lot and I can't keep my thoughts together. It rarely happens, though. 
No. I wear makeup because I like the way I look with it, and I like doing it too.
I don't relate to this. However, I feel extremely uncomfortable when there's too much movement around me. Like, people moving around, being noisy, or too much sensory stimuli.
Yes. I never leave the house if I don't look ""perfect"". I have to please myself first, then go out of the house.
Yes. I can be extremely meticulous.
I'm not much of a movie person anyway, but I tend to watch the same ones over and over, or stick to one genre.
I relate more to Se than Ne. My consideration of things is more based on what is concretely here in the moment, rather than abstract and ""away from reality"" possibilities. Also, my imagination is very ""earthy"", it has to have a root somewhere in reality. I base all my characters on people, for example. I don't like multicoloured designs either. I stick to what could work in reality.
Worldbuilding, creativity, and insights. I think in symbols, mainly, and I tend to associate people with various things of my own, for example (like, for example, someone's flower is the cornflower, their colour is blue, and their card is the Ace of Hearts). I don't trust my Ni enough to let it lead me in the world, but I play with it (that's how I figured out I was ISFP, not INTJ). 
Rose Lalonde from Homestuck. 
I'm confident I can bring out many, many ideas into physical things. I'm also confident I can get back on my feet no matter what happens, and that only my own internal compass won't ever fail me.
Not fond of it. I'm overstimulated quickly.
I hated school for the most part. I liked learning things, but I picked them up so quickly I got bored and I just doodled all the time. I only listened when I was interested in the topic or if I liked the subject (English, French, art, sometimes chemistry and biology). I got scolded several times for that, and I even got kicked out of a class on my senior year because the teacher thought I wasn't listening. In high school I even got as far as skipping because I felt like I had no purpose. School made me depressed and stressed because it's like your grades determine your worth as a person.
I think so. It's not like flying into space, it's more like kissing someone or planning a future with them. It's grounded. Again.
I internally feel it will work out, but yeah, I kind of need evidence. However, I still have this little voice in me that says ""yes"". It's difficult to explain.
I don't bother with that. All I know is that I'm reliable, I'm responsible, and I treat others like I want to be treated. It's their problem if they choose to act like assholes, not mine.
Depends. But usually I don't care.
"
280,isfp,"

I spill stuff every now and then. And I really hate when I do so ha ha. I don‚Äôt mind having a small splotch on my shirt because I can wash it.


When I do exercise, it because I‚Äôm bored tbh. I think I shut down when I feel some extreme emotion.


I‚Äôve experienced this somewhat. Not a sport, really, but I used to love being in the band in high school. Due to the rigor, I quit. And I still like basketball, I‚Äôve just never found the time to play it.


I prefer music and painting to writing. I like poetry alright, though.


I‚Äôm not into books that much. My favorite genre of book, however, is grimdark fantasy.


I don‚Äôt ask questions when hyper. If I am, I try to do something to ease the hyperactivity (exercising, talking, being jittery).


I rarely use makeup. When I do, I don‚Äôt really use it to reflect an emotion rather to feel confident or fancy.


I don‚Äôt mind stuff being moved around me. It might depend on how much stuff and what was done with said stuff though.


It is disappointing and uncomfortable whenever I leave a little unkempt. I need to at least shower.


Projects of any kind are what I‚Äôm most detailed with. School projects, painting, etc.


I used to rewatch films when I was younger. Now I usually prefer to look for something I haven‚Äôt watched before.


Not really sure I can say myself. I still new with cognitive functions lol.


I can‚Äôt really say much for that, either.


Never really had a character that made me think that I was them. There may be characters that have the same interests as me that I can somewhat relate to.


I‚Äôm confident in the potential in my abilities. I‚Äôm capable of doing lots, I just need motivation.


I don‚Äôt mind it. I tend to be lured into jobs that require some form of physical work as opposed to front desk jobs. 


The only things that annoying in school is homework. My favorite part about school is meeting up with some friends at lunch or doing a fun project or class.


Meh...not really...to be honest some are realistic but some are not.


Yeah. Sometimes I do try to have a positive, but realistic outlook on things. I feel that it‚Äôs healthier to do so, in my opinion.


I definitely feel like I‚Äôm in a gray area. Not a bad person, but definitely a person that needs to work on things in life.


Yeah, I can be impatient with things that I find boring or things that don‚Äôt interest me.


Hope this helps! I‚Äôm actually in the same boat as you are when it comes to being an IXFP."
281,isfp,"(ISFP)

Um... not really, no.
Yes, definitely. Doing a workout, dancing, taking a hike, going to the gym, ANYTHING physical or outdoors helps to settle my mind when anxious.
Yes, actually. The only sports I stuck with were sports I was naturally talented at from the start, which probably wasn't a good thing in retrospect.
I would like to be more into writing and admire people who are, but I'm just not. I do like reading, though.
I love reading. Self-help stuff, fiction (more realistic fiction, though), informative stuff in subjects I'm interested in, etc.
Um... when I'm hyper, I kind of point out more stuff in the environment/comment on it than ask ""what if"" questions.
Yeah, definitely. I do that with the way I dress, taking care of myself, etc. It all feels like a reflection of the inner state.
I don't know. I think it would get annoying if I had wanted stuff to be a prearranged way, yeah.
It depends. If I'm not looking how I would want to be represented as or how I'm feeling in that moment, then I would feel uncomfortable, yeah.
VERY detail-oriented with stuff like art, homework assignments, cleaning, etc.
I think I like to do both. There are definitely favorites that I'll rewatch again and again, or series/genres that I'll continuously explore within, but I also do get bored with the same old movies and want to find new ones that pique my interest & emotions.
Honestly, I just can't relate to the descriptions/explanations of an INFP. The idea of living in a world that is idealistic and full of fantasy sounds beautiful and amazing, but I just know I don't naturally live in that type of world and am much more in touch with the world in a visceral sense.
Se - constantly wanting to do stuff to experience the world depending on my values/emotions/whim. Ni - for some reason, this most prominently manifests for me as a love for crossword puzzles, riddles, intuitive problem-solving (I enjoy math for this reason, strangely enough).
Hmmm... I usually don't see ISFP-esque characters in fiction much. We as people tend to be pretty uninteresting from the outside xD I relate more to like, musicians and artists in pop culture (Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Mozart, etc.)
I'm confident about... my ability to cooperate with people, my ability to live mindfully and in the present, my particular artistic abilities (dance, yoga, music), my ability to stick close to my values and morals no matter what anyone else says or insinuates.
I don't mind it. It can be a nice escape from reality as a job for a little while, honestly.
What annoyed me in school were social hierarchies, peers who conformed to whatever was trendy and didn't seem to ever have opinions of their own, peers/teachers who complained incessantly, classes that felt pointless and overly abstract (trigonometry, I'm talking to you ;)). I LOVED reading, getting close to teachers I liked and could relate to, artsy classes (music, visual art, etc.) even though I didn't end up pursuing anything like that professionally, and having a few close friends that made the school day more bearable.
Yes, definitely. I try my best to make them happen as a form of keeping in touch with myself, so to speak. (Whether it's something random like going to a certain concert, playing a certain video game, doing a certain yoga position, etc.)
I think my Ni has gotten to the point where I can trust that things will work out. It takes a lot of effort sometimes, though :/ which is what having a lot of good people around you helps with a bunch.
I feel like a good person, yes. I think this is probably due to genuinely believing in and practicing a strong set of values that is nonetheless open to growth with cathartic life experiences. I don't like the idea of living life as a person who is internally morally ambiguous.
Not too impatient. How impatient am I with things that do apply to me, though? VERY ;D
"
282,isfp,"

I'm prone to spilling food, accidentally scraping/cutting myself, bruising, etc. I'm just extremely clumsy lol


Exercise isn'ttt my kinda thing XD I'm a musician so I lean more on playing my instruments or listening to music when I'm anxious or upset. If I can't do either I tend to find something to look at and find the beauty in it to calm myself down


I did experience something similar about a year ago (I'm so sorry this happened to you btw). Like I said, I'm a musician and so is my boyfriend's roommate. My boyfriend's roommate just believes that he knows everything about music and that if you believe anything different then you're wrong, so whenever I made comments about music he would shut me down or whenever I played my instruments he'd start playing his louder. I couldn't write any music for the better part of a year and had a breakdown about it until I forced myself to just sit at the piano for a good 20 minutes


I used to write all the time, but not so much anymore. I still live when I can though


I LOVE reading. The kind of genres that I lean toward are adventure or character growth stories. I can read anything as long as it paints a picture in my head


I do ask a lot of questions when I'm hyper lol My brain is all over the place and my body becomes restless. I talk a lot, fidget, and always have to be doing something


I can't makeup. I wish I could, but I'm not patient enough for it XD


I also hate when people move stuff around! I just find it and put it back


I'm just a more conservative dresser, so I feel uncomfortable showing my stomach or upper thighs and will refuse to leave the house if I'm showing too much


I'm very meticulous with how I cut my food, clean, and organize things


I get bored with the same thing, so I find new things and will usually cycle back around years later when I've forgotten it


I know I'm not an INFP because my boyfriend is one XD He's always thinking about all of the new things he can do and new possibilities whereas I tend to go with the flow more. He comes up with all of these passionate dreams that he has no idea how to accomplish them and I think of all of the steps he can take to get there


My Ni manifests as me having to figure things out on my own. I get frustrated when people try to force me to do or see things their way. I have to feel it out myself. My Se manigests as me noticing small details such as differences in smells or sounds, or focusing on aspects of the things that I see that most of the other people I know wouldn't care about


I used to be a huge fan of Avatar the Last Airbender and I feel like I relate a lot to Zuko. How calm, reserved, and bashful he is in later seasons mixed with how he's ready to jump on any new opportunities and learn more about himself and the way the people as well as the entire world  works around him


I'm not too confident about much XD Maybe my hugging abilities???


Manual labor is...okay. I'm fine with doing it if I have to, I'd rather not if I don't 


I. Hated. Projects. I never did them. Ever. I hated having to research things and then compare them to other things and...uh. Too much work. I also hated how crowded the halls were and how noisy it was. I loved my music classes and how easy it was to connect with the people there without even having to speak


Almost all of my daydreams are attainable, I just need to focus on them to get them done


I hope that things will work out, I just wait and see if they do


Most times I geel like a good person, if I do anything I feel is ""bad"" I sulk on it for a while


I'm just generally impatient so very lol


I hope this helps you!"
283,isfp,"

No


Yes. Physical activity clears my mind.


Yes. Se is competitive and hates to lose, but dominant Fi (backed by Se) can also lead you to become bored before you perfect your skills.


Not into writing, but I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm pretty good at it.


Love to read. Historical nonfiction, sci-Fi, and fiction young adults


No, I don‚Äôt usually entertain hypothetical scenarios. When I‚Äôm ‚Äúhyper‚Äù I play a sport, run, hula hoop, run errands, or just find a way to be moving.


I wear a little make-up but not enough to look like I‚Äôm wearing make-up


It pisses me off big time when people move my stuff. Also if they handle it roughly, pilfer through my things, disrespect my space...


I don‚Äôt know how to answer this. I always look sloppy but I also like the way I look, if that makes sense? Like I‚Äôll leave the house dressed like a hobo or a clown but I still think my face looks pretty. If I had like...a black eye or something no, probably not. I‚Äôm pretty vain about my appearance, even though it‚Äôs a low-effort look. Hope that helps


Yes. I‚Äôm meticulous with projects that I‚Äôm working on related to my hobbies (or school, once upon a time) and anything I pride myself on. 


I rewatch classic movies and listen to favorite songs over and over. I take comfort in the nostalgia and take a ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù approach to activities I enjoy.


This sounds mean to INFPs, but to answer your question honestly: I don‚Äôt relate to them as much as I do other SPs. I find them wimpy, awkward, whiny, and kind of annoying. Their humor is odd, their interests don‚Äôt appeal to me, and their heads are in the clouds.


Ni manifests as unchecked paranoia about other people and Se...well. I reek of Se. The wide eyed look, the way I carry myself, attention to detail, reflexes, short attention span, vanity, etc.


Alabama Worley from True Romance, Both Peter and Joanna from Office Space, Chris from Welcome to the Jungle (the Jean Claude Van Damme movie)...umm..Jennifer Lopez in that Monster in Law movie...


My looks and intelligence, although my confidence in both has begun to wane as I get older


It‚Äôs the only way to work without being bored off my rocker


Loved school. Even liked the social aspect of it. Nothing really annoyed me, except maybe math classes


I don‚Äôt really daydream. I have fantasized about people but not much else. And then when those people were available to me, I sabotaged the relationship. So not really daydreams so much as regret. I think daydreaming is kind of a waste of time and boring.


It used to. Not so much anymore.

"
284,isfp,"Is it bad form to post to 12 day old comments?  I think this is an interesting thread and questionnaire.  I've typed isfp by verification through study, insofar as the first four functions are concerned.  Shadow function gets a little dicey and I've tested as both infp and enfp, though I'm certain I lead with fi (aka an introverted judging function).  My biggest issue is that I seem to be higher in Ne than Se most days (even when I was a kid) though it's almost as if I use them equally.  I do have a theory about dominant introverted judging functions and the way our perceiving functions manifest but I won't get into that rn, lol.

No, I don't spill food on myself.  I'm not particularly conscious of my surroundings but I am very aware of my own body.
If I'm overly anxious or upset I'll do a bunch of chores.  I'm very active and I love running in particular so that kind of thing is daily routine for me (big chores binge, not so much).
I loved theater until I didn't land the lead in my first college production.  I didn't know what that kind of rejection felt like and was too immature to introspect on it so I decided that my professors knew nothing but that I obviously didn't have the talent I thought I did, so I quit (though I did come back and then quit again, for other reasons).
Writing got me through a lot of times.  Then I discovered art.
I love reading, mostly literature and philosophy/psychology.
I don't really get hyper.
Makeup-- I love lipstick, red in particular and unconventional colors (like black, green, blue) on occasion.  Otherwise I'm pretty minimal.  It's more important to me to be well groomed than made up and I do have oily skin, so I won't leave the house without a dusting of translucent powder and clear brow gel.  It seldom has anything to do with emotion or feeling.  I dress to match a mood and do a classic, minimalist face.
I hate it when people move things I use around on me because si id.  If it's not something I directly use, I probably won't notice.
Yes, it is painful to leave the house if I'm uncomfortable with my appearance but it won't ever have anything to do with messy hair or not showering.  It will have to do with having trouble matching my clothes to my mood, feeling fat, or a gigantic face pimple.  Ha.
Am I meticulous with anything?  Yes,my morning and night grooming routines.
I rewatch but I'm not really into movies or tv.
How do I know I'm not infp?  Because of my underdeveloped si.
How does my Ni manifest?  Idk, it's kind of just everywhere.  There's nothing particularly organized about my life or my mind but it's all connected and it all makes sense, at least to me.  Organized chaos, I guess.  My head is often in the clouds and I find it nearly impossible to be fully present.  Big events or happenings feel surreal, like I'm out of my body.  Things will just, like, occur to me and I can always connect how I got there but I can never articulate it.  As for Se-- I think that manifests in how I respond to sensual things, like the harmony and resplendence of a perfume melding with my natural skin scent; the flavor and nuance hitting my tongue in a well executed dish; the spiritual experience of certain music; the cold silence of a morning in January... things like that.  My Fi elevates sensual experience to profundity.  At least I think that's what's going on. lol.
Anyone in fiction who reminds me of myself-- √âowyn, LOTR; Arya Stark, GOT.
What am I confident about... My sense of self.
How do I feel about manual labor?  I don't really feel one way or another.  Is the question would I do it?  Then of course.  Is the question am I good at it?  Just tell me what to do and I'll do it and eventually I'll find a more efficient way of doing it.  Lol maybe I don't understand the question.
I hated everything about school, the social constructs, the expectations, the limitations, the formula you're ""supposed"" to follow, the game you're ""supposed"" to play to achieve a completely arbitrary level of success.  The moment I had a say in the  matter I opted out.  If you want to know the truth though, I sometimes wish I placed a higher value on my own education but I'm simply not going to do something I don't want to do and my job and income will never outweigh the things that truly move me.  Education is valuable and there are consequences to not following the beaten path.  However, I value truth to myself over impersonal measures of societal success and I know I'm happier for following my own path.
Are most of my daydreams attainable... I mean, they're more theoretical than anything so who knows?  Anything is possible.
Does my Ni make me feel like things will work out, or do I need evidence?  It's more that I know that I'll figure out how to handle whatever happens more than a vision of anything ""working out"" so I guess neither.  I take things in stride.
Do I feel I'm a ""good"" person or more grey?  Definitely more grey.  The struggle to attain ""good"" is constant and the goal lofty.  But it doesn't mean I don't try.
Oh, I'm impatient with things that do apply to me.  Inferior Te is very real, lol.  In fact I think I'm more impatient with things that do than don't.
"
285,isfp,"High Fi apparently correlates with high selfishness whereas high Ti correlates with high arrogance. In theory, INFPs would be pretty selfish too. Idk if I believe that selfishness is a bad thing, but to people who can't stand others talking about themselves, it seems Fi can be off putting. "
286,isfp,"There are quite a few similarities. Especially knowing daydreaming and thinking and so on happens with each type. It's strange to identify functions on the self, because others could see us differently. "
287,isfp,"I see a lot of me in this lol especially #8. 
My issue with Se is that I'm not sure to what extent I'm actually aware of my environment, but I do notice changes about it. I don't lose things easily, but I do spill things when I'm not paying attention. I do hope for the best and believe good will come Ni. Yet I can be very Ne random with what if questions and thoughts and I do super value Si comfort/thoughts/memories. "
288,isfp,"I have a... strange relationship with it. I think about it often especially when it's during introspection, but it's paradoxically what I fear the most. I don't use Si in a very healthy way, neither do I with Ne. For me it shows up as constantly fearing that the past will repeat itself and trying to push it behind, saying ""nah, it's not relevant anymore"". Also, Si shows up in me as that irrational fear of being ""bound"" to a certain routine. My mum, an ISTJ, for example, could eat the same thing every day and do the same thing everyday for a lifetime and not be bothered with it, while I'd go totally insane. She also doesn't fear the past like I do and uses it as a compass to get through in life. I'm entirely different from that. That's also why I didn't type as INFP, if I had Si in my ""conscious"" part, I would most likely be better at using it. "
289,isfp,"Interesting. Ive heard that 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th functions are all optimistic functions and the even numbered functions are all pessimistic. Maybe shadow functions make things even worse for pessimistic ones. "
290,isfp,"A game on Steam. The VR in the game title stands for Virtual Reality. You can meet and chat with new people and explore many different maps. It's even better if you have a headset and a powerful PC that can run the game smoothly. Sadly, I have neither, lol. "
291,isfp,PlayStation Home was really cool. You created an Avatar and we‚Äôre free to roam the space with all other PlayStation home players and it was FREE! I made some cool friends there. You could even get married. 
292,isfp,"Fe-doms are said to be the best match for us, and I regularly find myself being attracted to them at firs, but I realize I can't stand them after a while. I find them increasingly annoying. Their whole thing of ""I know what's best for you, and I know better than you what you need"", ""that's not good, you should change"". Bullshit, you don't know me, you don't know someone better than they know themselves, and I'm not changing. I am myself, and I deserve to be myself like anyone deserves it. Their thing of giving overly sweet nicknames to every single of their friends (""darling"", ""sweetie"", ""my dear""). I rarely ever give nicknames like that. The Fe-doms I met also have that thing of being ""friends"" with everyone until you cross them, and have that ""it's either with us or against us"" thing. They're shallow, pretend to be open-minded while they won't accept anything that doesn't fit their codes, and will smile while they backstab you. Maybe I didn't meet the right ones too, that could be why I'm currently ranting. But I rarely ever can stand them. Yet, they're said to be the best match for us ISFPs. Fuck no. I'm never marrying one of them. I wouldn't be able to stand them for a lifetime."
293,isfp,"It's refreshing to see a non-NT who sees it as well.  I'm an INTJ and you hit the nail on the head on the most annoying characteristics of Fe-doms.  What I resent the most is that they insist on shoving their emotional burden onto others, instead of owning that they are having a poor reaction to something that someone said/did, that was not meant in a negative way... but they take offense to it and then they try to make the other person feel bad about it and blame them."
294,isfp,"Probably you have met immature Fe doms? I have so many IxFPs who are very close to my heart and who I deeply love, and we understand each other on a very deep level, especially when it comes to our feelings and emotions. We get along very well! :)"
295,isfp,"

It's not Fe-doms but Te-doms. The function that Fi helps to counter-balance is Te: ISFP Love Types so if you have been going after Fe-doms that is the source of your problems."
296,isfp,"I've met both good and bad high Fe users.
The most annoying was this guy (IXFJ) who would push his opinions onto me and try to control my actions, ended our friendship pretty fast. We are in the same major and he would look after all the other students like a mother hen and sacrifice a lot of his time to help them so I admired him at first but then decided he needed to spend more time bringing his own grades up. 
My mother, an ESFJ, is a narcissist and would try to control me to the point of stalking my facebook messages. She hates it when I'm not sweet and nice to her and acts really fakely nice and the life of party to guests. 
Though one of my good friends is Fe and he made me realize that group dynamics are really important and looked after everyone in a non-controlling way. He said that he's happiest when everyone else is. "
297,isfp,"Yes! My ESFJ ex-friend did that. She shoved her emotional shit on me just because I said I wasn't interested in her country... I didn't judge it, I didn't say it was bad, and any normal person would have thought ""good, at least you like me for who I am, not for where I come from"". But no. She took offense and threw a storm of insults at me. I couldn't even say a word. I was constantly walking on eggshells in fear of triggering her rage by doing x small thing that wouldn't be good, or saying x thing she wouldn't like. Also, she would get pissed everytime I took extra time to react, while first, I'm an introvert, and second, I was so mentally exhausted that it could only happen. Good thing I'm free from all of this."
298,isfp,"Ugh, emotional dependency, you hit the nail. They expect you to be the same, and if you don't fit their ""internal image of you"", they get angry at you and ""scold"" you for that. Can't stand ""playful"" insults either. Insults are insults, regardless of the context."
299,isfp,"For some reason I feel your friend is more of an ISFJ than INFJ, but he sounds like a really... yeah, annoying guy. No one should force their opinions on someone else, period. He sounds like an extreme codependent person, and this ""disorder"" seems to be quite common in xxFJs.
I had an ESFJ friend until not too long ago, who was also a narcissist. She would subtly make everything about her, told me the most degrading things I could ever hear, insulted me, told me no one loved me, was always telling me ""it's not good, you should change"", and funny thing, she still wanted me to travel with her after that. She didn't like it when I finally called her out on her bullshit and left.
My dad is also an ESFJ, and I don't know if he's a narcissist, but he is all about how he appears to others. He has an excessive need for admiration, he morphs into every woman he meets (copying her tastes, her way of thinking, he's not static), is a pathological liar, and is overly showing of his emotions. He always tries to give me unsolicited advice and attention, and that stresses me out. I was very close to him as a child, but something happened and now I reject his calls because he doesn't seem to take the hint that I don't want to talk to him.
Either I have terrible luck with ESFJs, either I just can't stand them. But the way you describe your good friend, he sounds like a genuinely good guy. He's probably the healthy variant of ESFJ. :) Thanks for sharing your experience. "
300,isfp,"I feel like that IXFJ is more S too but I don't have enough proof. That guy also failed a lot of his classes but still kept answering PMs from a lot of people who wanted his help. He seemed to make these speeches on FB about hard work discipline blah blah. I doubt he represents all ISFJs though. 
Damn what your ESFJ friend said to you was what my mom always said to me. You should have left way earlier, friends don't say that bullshit to each other. My mom always cares about appearances too, she makes sure our house looks as pretty as possible before guests arrive and even set her Facebook profile picture to our house. She brags about my paintings she hang on the wall and over-compliments everyone, their mothers, their dogs and cats. 
My friend is probably ENFJ actually, he is pretty good at making abstract conversation. While my mom thinks my sense of humor is dumb and immature he is able to play along with it, lol. But I don't doubt there's healthy ESFJs around, I would especially like the ones with good Ne."
301,isfp,"I've noticed there's often some awkward friction between ISFPs and ESTPs. As a child I was often bullied (not extremely, but I was definitely bullied), and I think many of them were either ENTPs or ESTPs. They also tend to think I'm weird.
Aside from that, I've also befriended a few ESTPs throughout my life, and out of all my friends I find that I've had the most fights with the ESTPs. Sometimes I just say something (unintentionally) that rubs them the wrong way and they get mad at me (for example, my current boss is an ESTP and I had a conflict with him a few times, every time because apparently I hinted at him being a liar, like wtf).
Also, I notice ENTPs often tend to like INFPs, but as for ESTPs liking ISFPs.. literally one of the first things I find when I enter ""ISFP"" in /r/estp is this.
Finally, I find that we talk past each other a lot. Every time I share an opinion or view I have, I get the (Ti?) reply ""and why is that?"". Likewise, every time I ask them for an opinion or view they don't really know how to respond. And in general, I'm pretty good at making people laugh, but ESTPs never react to my humor (my ESTP friends sometimes do a forced exhale through the nose)."
302,isfp,"Interesting, I can‚Äôt relate to this thread at all. I adore ESTPs, and they have always been well represented among my closest friends and family members.
I love working with them, hanging out with them, joking with them, and adventuring with them in general.
I used to think they were somewhat shallow but then I learned first hand how brilliant they can actually be (my kid is one) and they are kinda some of my favorite people now."
303,isfp,"""Hate"" may be too strong a word, but they likely do experience an aversive reaction. It's even called out by name in the highest upvoted response to the thread you linked. It's called a supervisor/supervisee relationship in socionics, and is charactererized by the supervisor desperately trying to introduce their dominant function (Fi for the ISFP) into the supervisee's life, but since the same function is the ESTP's vulnerable function/point of least resistance, they will resist said efforts even more desperately. This can make the supervisor feel paternalistic while the supervisee just gets drained of energy and feels the need to get away from the supervisor as far and as quickly as possible.
ESTP's can probably be particularly baffled (as expressed by the OP in the linked thread) by encountering their supervisors, since they are very seldom confronted with any kind of situation capable of draining their energy. Rising up to and defying challenges, against the worse odds the better, is kind of their thing, after all.
To better understand their reaction, consider your own vulnerable function/point of least resistance, Ne. The supervisor type of ISFP is the type which has this function as their dominant, but has the ISFP's dominant function, Fi, as their auxiliary. In other words, the ENFP. Your experiences interacting with this type should follow a similar dynamic, where the ENFP tries in vain to impose their strongest function, Ne, upon you, but you will recoil because it is your vulnerable function."
304,isfp,"ESTPs and ISFPs will generally not associate unless they‚Äôre related. ESTPs kind of lack morals, and will range from being complete scumbags (especially when younger) to principled people, but there will always be a sense of a selfish, cutthroat cunning to them.
I have a love-hate relationship with this type, on one hand their inner strength and aggression is actually greatly admirable, but their callousness can nonplus me sometimes. If they are intelligent and good as a person, they can be incredible people."
305,isfp,"Idk. I have an ESTP acquiantance who I kind of get the vibe from that he's confused by me and wants nothing to do with me for some reason. But then again there were some positive comments from them about ISFPs in the thread I made there, so idk. 
Made me wonder though, since Fe users usually like to feed off of the emotion and the ""mood"" in others, might Fi confuse them (ESTPs in particular) since it always strives to display the most ""authentic"" state, and how we actually feel in the moment? Is that why they would hate us? lol"
306,isfp,"Estp here, my best friend is an ISFP, wouldn't change him one bit, our friendship pretty much goes against everything the supervisee concept claims, pretty sure a lot of the stuff comes down to the individuals themselves other than the types! "
307,isfp,"Ultra late to this but I had to comment on a comment from the thread you mentioned:
Lol, oh man.  Those would be my exact words if a friend asked me why I wanted to go through a sunny meadow instead of a dark thick forest.  Darkness and stuff is scary and stuff can hide then pounce on you if you‚Äôre not careful.  
But yeah, if the guy at the end showed me that he can get though safely by arriving to the spot safe and sound, then I may reconsider my feelings and follow the guy through next time... though I would always feel that fear.  "
308,isfp,Is this why ENTPs don't really seem to share the sentiment with regards to INFPs?
309,isfp,"This is how I‚Äôve begun to view ENTJs. But yeah, I guess I can see how the worst version of an ESTP can seem like you describe. They‚Äôre incredibly opportunistic."
310,isfp,"I find myself being much more relaxed around Fi users, personally. I think because my Fe wants to cater to others in order to have social cohesion. In a room full of Fe users, I'm always a tad on edge because nobody makes a decision as to what to do; so it's always, ""I don't care, really. Whatever you guys want to do."" I've known Fi users to always have an idea or speak their minds flat out because they seem to know what they want more often than Fe users, in social scenarios at least. It makes me more comfortable because I'm happy to go with the flow as long as others are having a good time, because that means I'm having a good time too as I tend to feed off of the energy levels of other people. I really admire Fi users for their individualistic tenacity.
Edit: am ESTP"
311,isfp,"Here's an example I posted a while ago.
With my boss I've had this twice, once like in the post, and another time which is a bit complicated to explain here, but it boils down to me talking to someone on the phone nearby him and me wording things to the person on the phone a bit weirdly which leads to him thinking I'm accusing him of being a liar."
312,isfp,"Probably yes. This is a supervision relationship as well, where the INFP (my type) attempts to introduce Fi into the life of the ENTP, but they respond extremely negatively due to Fi being vulnerable to them. Similarly, the ESFP is the supervisor of the INFP, where they try to impose their dominant Se upon us, which will make us instinctively recoil."
313,isfp,I think they walk around with an air of arrogance and don't even realize it or perceive themselves as such. They are blunt and not sensitive enough for ISFP. ISFP tries to understand and accept the personality of ENTJ but ENTJ doesn't even try for ISFP. 
314,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and my boyfriend's an ENTJ. We've been dating for almost 6 years. Definitely things we don't agree on, but we get along really well! There are times where I just want to be left alone and he just wants to talk. Gets annoying sometimes. I need my space! 
Sorry, little late to the game on this post. :P"
315,isfp,"Introversion versus extraversion is a bit silly. All it really means is what we need to ""re-charge"", or how we gain energy. I feel like being an introvert doesn't mean you're a shy person, it just means that you need some personal time each day after expending all your energy with other people."
316,isfp,"Look into the functions and how they affect behavior.
Also, introversion and extraversion are about how you recharge. You can have an extremely friendly and outgoing introvert, and you can have a shy, reserved extravert. It's about where you get your energy.
I like being around people, but I find it exhausting, and need some alone time to process everything that happened and relax. That makes me an introvert."
317,isfp,"This cracked me up, because I too, wonder the same.
I 'm certainly and ISFP, but people call me extrovert most of the time.
I also love to discuss things in depth, like an ENFP... I'm amazing, I know :)
I think it's relatively simple to see.
Do you feel normal about going out and talk to random strangers in the street, or talking to girls/guys you're interest in, or find attractive? Or would you probably cross the street if there is a bunch of girls/guys sitting on your path, and you feel a bit uncomfortable that they look at you?
Are you more social, or more reserved?
That kind of answer will tell you who you are.
Anyway, your questions is probably more along the lines of this:
https://www.talentinsights.com/blog/introverted-feeling-vs-extroverted-feeling/"
318,isfp,"That's not really how it works. The E and I aren't saying that a person is introverted or extroverted. It's simply saying that the person's dominant function is introverted or extroverted (ISFP - Introverted Feeling is the dominant function, ESFP - Extroverted Sensing is dominant). You can be an ISFP and be an extrovert or be an ESFP and be introverted."
319,isfp,"Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. 
It's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) 
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test"
320,isfp,"For me:
INTJ: Kinda like inverted ISFPs (Ni Te Fi Se vs Fi Se Ni Te). Generally speaking, great people which I tend to have the best conversations with. 
INTP: On a surface level, I can get along well with them, but a really deep friendship is a bit hard. Tend to be very hit or miss people in general, to me. 
INFJ: Like an ISFJ, but more relaxed and easier to have deep conversations with. I tend to mistype them for INTPs when get serious, though. 
INFP: Pretty cool people all around, but I sometimes get this feeling that they secretly dislike ISFPs for some reason. 
ISTJ: I don't have much experience with them, but from what I can tell they're basically more tough and less open minded INTJs. They usually mean well, though. 
ISTP: I get along with them really well. The only thing I tend to avoid around them is more feeling oriented topics, since alongside INTPs I consider them the least feeling type. Tend to be quite polite to me as well. 
ISFJ: Generally really nice people, but you don't want to make them mad, they're either Jesus 2 or Hitler. They have this weird ability to just disable their feelings altogether when they get serious. I can't say I understand their selfless attitude, though. Probably Fi vs Fe. 
ISFP: Kinda hard to say, actually. I just see this type as me. 
ENTJ: Less likeable INTJs (tert Fi vs inf Fi, I think), and more bossy (Ni dom vs Te dom).
EDIT: Maybe a bit of a hard description, I think they can be pretty cool too. They're just harder to connect to than an INTJ. Having an ENTJ gf sounds pretty cool
ENTP: If every personality type was a candy, this one is crystal meth. To me, completely random and indecipherable. They're quite similar to a chimpanzee in some ways, at first they seem okay, and they may even appear to like you, but then after a few minutes they may just rip off your face for the lols. On paper you'd think they're basically extroverted INTPs, but they have this really vicious way of talking and toying with everything INTPs don't. I feel like they're wielding some sort of knife that only ISFPs can see, other types don't really mind them. 
ENFJ: Outside of the excessive ""you can do it! believe in yourself"" thing (let me be self-conscious!) they're great people.
ENFP: I call this one the glittery lesbian type, pretty cool people. 
ESTJ: I know very little about this type, but I once had this teacher who I guess was one. A pretty nasty person, extremely by the book and would punish you for about anything, with a big nasty smile.
ESTP: A of a weird version of the ISTP. Much more aggressive than ISTPs, they tend to be the stereotypical bully (that spends way too much time getting tanned). OR they're that cool friend who's always doing something reckless. Not a fan of ISFPs, as far as I can tell. 
ESFJ: Friendly, but something overbearing. 
ESFP: A weird version of the ISFP. On paper they seem like great people, but they're kinda like ESTPs to me. Can be really intimidating in groups, tend to be ridiculously loud and will shout profanity at you for no reason. OR they're like that ESTP friend, except a bit more pep talk-y and warm."
321,isfp,"I do not dislike ISFPs! I adore you. You have strong values just like us, but you act on them. You do things. 
As an INFP who suffers from procrastination and lack of follow-through, I admire ISFPs. I actually wanted to turn into an ISFP (or an INFJ) when I was younger. Now I am cool with my type but that‚Äôs how much I envied your spontaneity and action.
I also admire how down-to-earth you are. You do not think about pointless things. (Unless you are stuck in the Fi-Ni loop.)
I imagine an ISFP‚Äôs head as a meadow where a calm breeze is ever blowing. 
I imagine my head as a deep sea cave where shining, rainbow-colored bubbles are ever forming.
I want to lie down on that meadow sometimes and forget about everything.
The thing is, even though I adore you, I sometimes find it hard to connect to you. You are so tuned to the world. I am forever in my head. So I look at you distantly with a bit of longing. 
‚ÄúYou are such charming people. And I lack the capacity to keep you company.‚Äù
Do not mistake this distant gaze as hidden hatred! That‚Äôs not it and never will be."
322,isfp,"ESTP - pretty sure my boss is this type. Definitely intimidating, but I appreciate how he always seems energetic. He seems to like that I am easy to talk to. I feel like some estps find us boring if they don‚Äôt get to really know us
ISTP - I think of mostly quite people who aren‚Äôt afraid to say things others might feel uncomfortable with. Thats cool in my book. I always thought of istps as ‚Äúcooler‚Äù isfps lol.
ENTJ - People who get shit done. I prefer not spending much time around this type just because I don‚Äôt want to get in there way. 
INTJ - My sibling is an INTJ, we get along great. I think my agreeableness nicely compliments the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always right‚Äù mindset of INTJs lol. I never really agreed with the stereotype they‚Äôre arrogant.
ENTP - Funny, but also really mean. Entps seem to care about nothing while I care about EVERYTHING. I agree I think isfps see them holding a knife that other types just don‚Äôt see.
INTP - Creative but also seem like robots.  My favorite musician David Byrne is supposed to be an INTP so that‚Äôs cool
ENFP - Friendly people. These are the best people to work with because they usually seem quite happy
INFP - ISFPs but with poetry, imagination, and impractical goals lol. One infp I knew was kind of a self centered dick but that‚Äôs just one person.
ISTJ - Scary if you piss them off. Generally though  pretty level headed people.
ESTJ - My dad‚Äôs type. Tough, letting criticism roll right-off their back, a trait I have always been jealous of. Like ENTJs they get shit done. Nicer than people give them credit for, they are careful about showing it.
ENFJ - Very optimistic people. I feel like a lot of my favorite teachers/Professors were ENFJs
INFJ - My mom‚Äôs type. Pretty similar to isfps honestly accept infjs seem to have a greater want to help other people. In my experience this type is really passive aggressive.
ISFJ - My best friend‚Äôs type. Super nice people. Has a strong desire to help others in need.
ESFJ - Very outgoing people who can sometimes come off as unintentionally annoying from their desire for everyone else to be happy.
ESFP - People who love attention basically, not thats necessary a bad thing. Can be extremely fun to be around and they talk non stop. Difficult to have deep conversations with.
ISFP - My type! I think it‚Äôs difficult to get to know other ISFPs because I don‚Äôt think we ever set out to meet new people unless we have to. Soft spoken and artsy in some way. "
323,isfp,"INTJ: every INTJ I‚Äôve met I‚Äôve had some strange unspoken connection to.  Extreme introverts. Very clever yet calming people. 
ENTJ: really go go go. It seems like that can‚Äôt really be happy unless they‚Äôre moving on to the next goal. Very blunt and honest. Enjoyable people if they are not at work I‚Äôd say? 
ISTJ: can be extremely controlling and narrow minded. But can also be very caring and dedicated people. Tend to get along with them pretty well in short bursts.
ESTJ: conversational masters and very extroverted. I really enjoy every ESTJ I‚Äôve ever met. They‚Äôre very motivated and a force of nature. Tend to care way too much about what people think of them/they‚Äôre status. Very smart as well.
ENTP: funny, witty, moral-less bastards. Fun to be around but the amount of data and just general bs they spew out can be exhausting. Tried to date one once and it was hilariously abysmal. 
INTP: a less crazy and talkative version on the ENTP. Capable of keeping an alarming amount of information in their heads. The mad scientist stereotype rings pretty true for this one. 
ESTP: the cool guys. the mean guys. the salespeople. Don‚Äôt have much else to say. 
ISTP: zen-surfer type people. Crazy hardworking when they are interested in the task. Very gifted  with tactile/mechanical problem solving. VERY unemotional. 
ENFJ: ‚ÄúI JUST WANT EVERYONE TO BE HAPPY‚Äù and super pissy if everyone isn‚Äôt happy. Can be very, very manipulative but generally just want the best for people. Conversational masters as well.
INFJ: very talkative around people they are comfortable with. A lot of the ones I know have photographic memories. Social chameleons and fake extroverts. Dedicated to people they care about but will door slam them and never look back for some pretty obscure reasons. 
ESFJ: money-pinchers. Very responsible and dependable. Obsessed with their image and can be very manipulative. But typically very kind. 
ISFJ: I love dem. They are my friends. Very very caring and less obsessed with their image. They are capable of putting up with A LOT. Extremely strong people.
ESFP: THE ULTIMATE EXTROVERT. Heavily invested in the overall ‚Äúexperience‚Äù of life. Thrill seekers. Will talk to anyone about anything. 
ISFP: it me 
ENFP: stoked about everything. Very very enthusiastic. Need their alone time more then any other extrovert. Very fun and warm people while being extremely intelligent. The one I know is fluent in Hebrew and has is a PhD. 10/10 would be cousins with one again. 
INFP: i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever met one "
324,isfp,"A few of these typesi dont know if ive ever encountered so ill just skip those ones
Intj: this is my bfs type so im biased in favor of them. they always have this cool smart vibe and im always impressed with them. Some intjs ive met have been arrogant assholes tho. 
Intp: i really admire them and i wish is was as smart and logical as they are. They have this Fe mask tho that is sometimes well developed and sometimes not and i find it hard to maneuver around because i can see it. They are usually cool tho.
Infp this is my sisters type! Shes the only one i know personally so i cant really say much about them but although they can be pretentious as fuck theyre fun and funny and thoughtful. I dont really speak the Ne language tho.
Infj: never met one
Istj: only one i know is my bfs brother who i havent conversed with much. Hes really kinda mechanical and doesnt talk much. He is super quiet around me but my bf says hes a pretty cool guy and very level headed and overall chill although stubborn about certain things.
Istp: they are cool folks i can usually get on with them ok. 
Isfj: my best friend is one. Theyre always super caring and can be gossipy but they are in general kind hearted folk. I always like the isfjs i meet.
Isfp: thats me and honestly i get along best with this type. We are just chill people and yea. Can be passive aggressive and aloof but i get it so i dont mind it that much.
Entj: ugh i really dont like entjs that much and im not really equipped to interact to them well. They are always so smart and opinionated tho so i admire that about them. I wish i could be a little more like them.
Entp: i dont really like interacting with entps because they are kinda full of themselves in my experience and they dont really see me anyway.
Enfj: they are really likable people and theyre fun to be around but yeah i dont interact well with extroverts in general but theyre cool ppl.
Enfp: it seems a lot of theater ppl are this type. I love enfps theyre amazing.
Estj: very annoying type when immature. When mature and humble they make great managers.
Estp: im not sure if ive met one im not too familiar with this type.
Esfj: the ones ive met have been bitchy so idk what the non bitchy ones are like but im sure there are cool ones.
Esfp: i like them. the ones ive known have been flirty and funny and fun to be around. I love what they add to the atmosphere.
Yeah any Fe users i have trouble interacting with. I have trouble interacting with Fe in general. Looking back I guess these have not been very good descriptions but more like a ""like vs not like"" typa thing oh well xD"
325,isfp,"no idea what i'm doing
INTJ: Most of my friends. The coolest and easiest to be around once theyre socialised. I'm not sure they understand tenderness, though. 
INTP: Hilarious. Dry but silly wit.
INFJ: Don't think I know any. Not really drawn to them online. 
INFP: Do seem to often fit the romantic/floral or emo/goth thing. am a bit in awe of the clever ones that have a sense of perspective/know themselves. 
ISTP: I guess I've worked mostly with these. I'm indifferent (which can be relatively good). And it's probably the 'persona' I initially adopt/disguise myself with in masculine environments (work).
ISFP: Add value just by being a calm presence. Maybe a bit preoccupied. Cool, but struggle to cultivate?
ENTJ: I don't get them at all.
ENTP: Mischievous. Challenging, but in a good way (in small doses). Seem to like me because i play with them, but i can't keep up for long.
ENFJ: I don't know any.
ENFP: I relate a bit, because I think they're also stuck in the present moment a bit too much (even though they fantasise), flitting about with their ideas. makes them a bit childlike; fun, but possibly temperamental/capricious.  
ESTJ: no idea
ESTP: no idea. I guess i'm oblivious to ES people. masomanos
ESFJ: ?? 
ESFP: I think I know a couple. rambunctious and fun. can't fully relax around them though. i might have completely the wrong type in mind"
326,isfp,"Hey, fellow ISFPs! As you know, many people use mbti as a tool for self improvement. I think it‚Äôs brilliant for that - but it can be kinda confusing where to start/how to go about this. 
So, what are some tips/advice for bettering yourself? Or stories on how you went about this? Ideally aimed at ISFPs as, well, this is the sub! However; the advice doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be to do with mbti. Also doesn‚Äôt need to be anything huge - whatever you have that can help with improving general happiness/life is welcome!"
327,isfp,"Actually doing rather than just leaving it to someday. Someday isn't a day of the week, actually do stuff. Set yourself small, medium, big goals. That way you will keep yourself happy when you achieve the smaller ones and you don't get bored as you reach the bigger ones. Get yourself 3 hobbies.
1. To make you money:
Can be anything from doing photography to doing stocks.
2. To keep yourself fit:
Doesn't necessarily have to be going to the gym, you can do things such as gardening even to keep you fit.
3. To make you happy and have something to look back on:
Try stay away from hobbies like video games. I used to play them a lot and still do from time to time however they just give you quick dopamine and not proper happiness. You can't really reflect on something from a video game and say wow Im so proud of this and tell someone else about it, no one's really gonna give a crap. Try something like drawing, painting, playing an instrument etc. Not saying video games are bad, I still love them but I hope you get what I mean.
Also just try being positive and treat people how you want to be treated. If you treat people well, they will do the same to you. If someone is a dick to you and you're nice to them they're gonna look like a bigger dick to others.
Hopefully these tips help :) "
328,isfp,"working out on a set routine(not necessarily time of day, I go whenever I have time which can vary). works sort of like meditation for me on top of the other benefits. I'm not into bodybuilding too much or anything, but it's still fun to see your body change and to improve your appearance
also I have found that drawing something is nice for the same reasons. feels like a way of meditation in the sense that you're focused on one thing and not worrying about other things you can't control in that moment. something about creation feels very good for my mental health"
329,isfp,"One thing that I definitely do is spend time with myself, people can be very difficult and for me spending time alone reading books or drawing helps me tremendously. Another thing for me in general is learning, learning from taking classes or visiting museums, expanding my knowledge is the best way to become a better person. "
330,isfp,"Learning mbti taught me some strengths about myself that I could celebrate and that expressing myself was ok; I didn't like expressing before, because after a period of time what I had made looked so different from what I felt and I was uncomfortable with having an evolving ""aesthetic"" but now I see it as normal and I get rid of old expressions that give me dysphoria."
331,isfp,"Regarding video games, I try to intentionally only try ones that look like they would be inspiring, like with a compelling story, or beautiful visuals. And be aware of what feels like a rut and when they don't inspire.
‚Äã
For example, I'm glad I've played ones like Kentucky Route Zero. I can reflect back on parts of it and it still gives me some impression to draw from."
332,isfp,"Wow - I absolutely agree with those three points! Seems like a happy life can be achieved by just following those three. I like to think I‚Äôm fulfilled in them atm, and I‚Äôm happy. Whenever one of the points is weaker, I‚Äôll feel worse off. Big appreciation for pointing that out! 
Positivity is also key. Being positive with people makes me positive with myself too. Being nice always the way to go. Thanks a lot!"
333,isfp,"Ashamedly, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen that movie. Terrible - I know.. but I‚Äôll reserve it for one of those nights.
Absolutely. Pets are brilliant. As is time bending art. It‚Äôs hard to find; but worth it. Can‚Äôt be forced. It‚Äôll come to you man, that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs best. "
334,isfp,"When you like someone, you look at them with rose-tinted glasses, take those off and take a step back. Try to think about the situation from a 3rd person perspective, what would you tell someone/your friend who comes to you for advice regarding a similar situation? Anyway, the same words are what you should be telling yourself, write them down somewhere and read it whenever necessary. This helps you think more objectively as you detach yourself from the issue and there's articles on this which you can search up if you want to read more. "
335,isfp,I go on a trip in seclusion with my dog. Once I drove to a small mountain town in Colorado with my dog Ares and spent 5 days hiking and swimming in hot springs and living in my truck. Another time I moved to California with nothing for 3 months and realized how much life there sucked. Maybe going through a bit of roughness puts things in perspective? I also found someone new pretty soon after both times
336,isfp,"Moving on from someone is one of the most difficult things to do, at least it was for me. You always want to cling on to that shred of hope that you'll be with them. But sometimes you just have to make the decision to let go. I've found that starting a new hobby, or even making new friends, away from that individual really helps. As an introvert, putting yourself out there like that can be scary, but in the long run it really does wonders. I realize that I'm saying the same thing as everyone else on here, but from personal experience, it really does work. Eventually you'll find yourself thinking about them less and less everyday, and then one day you won't think about them at all."
337,isfp,"I (M 42)have this same problem.. moving on when the person doesn't feel the same is difficult. I think it's difficult for most people but it seems more difficult for me. 
After my last breakup that was just one of those life-changing type events, I took a long look at myself and my identity when I ""finally"" buy in to a relationship. I realized I let the relationship become part of my identity instead of being a separate person within the relationship. So if the relationship failed and it had morphed into my identity then what did that mean for me? Like I said, lot of internal inventory type stuff had to happen. 
I remember during that last one complaining to a friend that ""I had let this person in"" and all these ""things"" happened. I realized that I can count on 2 fingers the times I had a relationship get anywhere close to me, so if one gets past those levels of seperation then it's gonna be a tough out if it falls apart. I'm not entirely sure if that's my ISFP/ADHD or just how I'm put together.. 
Letting go and realizing everytime (in retrospect) it was absolutely for the best helps immensely "
338,isfp,"i don‚Äôt wanna make a second post lmao
also just confirmed my type as ISFP!! 
1)do you guys ever seem like extroverts? like i mistyped as an ESFP for a while until i looked deep into the functions. i love being around people and having fun, and i‚Äôve heard that ISFP is the most extroverted introvert. your experience?
2) anyone else with Borderline Personality Disorder and/or depression?"
339,isfp,"Depends on the context for me! I'm thinking of extroversion more in terms of mannerisms/behaviour. i'm not too informed on mbti/functions, so can't talk about it in those terms.  
I reckon I can 'switch on' extroversion if the situation calls for it. But I don't get a lot of practice, so maybe it appears ridiculous xD  
I don't think so. How's that working out for you?"
340,isfp,"I thought I was an esfp too for awhile lol.  I can be pretty extroverted but I def like my alone time and I use more fi than se.  
I‚Äôm unconfirmed on borderline personality disorder, but I definitely relate to a lot of the characteristics.  I‚Äôm leaning more towards bipolar since I have a lot of highs and lows and have had manic episode experiences in the past."
341,isfp,"They were lying down in a single bed watching some series and movies, when she said: -hey!  What if we could get into a movie?
‚Äîcould be an indie movie please? I don‚Äôt like the fan service.
‚Äîyes! In a indie mumblegore drama movie, what would be your name?
‚Äîwait, why it has to be drama?
‚Äîshut up, what would be your name?
‚ÄîI‚Äôd like to be called... Kyo.
‚ÄîYou have given that name to the characters in our videogames.
‚Äîyes, and if I had a dog I‚Äôd put him that name while I wait for having a kid‚Äî. She got playful and looked him in the eyes:
‚Äîso you‚Äôd want to have a baby? ‚Äîshe asked
‚ÄîI mean... ‚Äîshe got closer, ready to embrace him, and he felt in a siege of intimacy in where her look was a powerful transparent trojan horse.
‚Äîwhat does your name means?
‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know. It surely has a general meaning, but you‚Äôre the one who puts a meaning to your name, right?
She looked at him perplexed and excited: ‚Äîyeah! having an assigned meaning is silly. I‚Äôll be Yui EmbraceYourFavoriteSocks.
He laughed and asked: ‚Äîwhat?
she took advantage of the fact that he lowered the guard, and suddenly tried to kiss him quickly, but she hurt her lip with his teeth. She lamented: ‚Äî How stupid, I ruined our first kiss :‚Äô(
He kissed her and said: ‚Äîpersonaly, I feel this kiss is just as good as what the other would have been.
The phone alarm rang. Kyo had to leave his room and go to work. Why does everything end at the most inappropriate moment?
‚Äã

‚Äã
I'm planning to write a page every week because if I don't do it I'll become a sloth. Also, I'd like this to have illustrations. any illustrator here wants to work with me in this project? it could be your style, and also, simple drawings, not much effort."
342,isfp,"I'm not sure how relevant this is to ISFP but I've recently realized being ignored is the quickest way to make me inappropriately angry. Seems strange considering I don't usually want to stand out too much, but when I do put myself out there I want to be acknowledged."
343,isfp,"I only get upset when I get interrupted. I dont care too much if people dont come talk to me, but when I'm talking to someone and they just talk over me, it fricking ticks me off. I already dont talk a whole lot in the first place, so when I do and still get ignored is one of my biggest pet peeves. I do my very best to listen to people fully and I rarely interrupt because I know how rude it is. "
344,isfp,"I hate getting ignored or interrupted, I find it disrespectful and often resent the person even if they didnt mean to do it. Try to raise your voice, dont talk more than you need to, act assertive, pay attention to body language etc. "
345,isfp,"Can't say for other ISFP or other types, but I feel it's that way for me. That's not to say I don't have appreciation for things outside my interests though - I've traveled to various places in the US and abroad, played different musical instruments, taken singing and art classes, and studied several languages. But in the end, I wouldn't say I was interested enough to dedicate my life to doing or studying any of those things further. Whenever I'm truly interested in something though, I tend to get really into it."
346,isfp,"My parents were already old when they had me so I wasn't updated on pop culture. I was pretty sheltered as a kid too, so lack of exposure to things didn't help either. I definitely need to branch out and try new hobbies because right now I'm losing interest in current ones and I'm terrified I won't have much of a personality. Sometimes I feel like I hang onto interests for the sake of it. I know eventually I have to let it go because I no longer enjoy it. It's difficult to make friends when you have a niche set of topics you want to discuss while the other person has no clue what you're talking about."
347,isfp,"If you asked 3 years prior, I would've said yes, but I've found that I value exploration both related to my senses and how I express myself. I do, however, like to hold close to what I know I like/dislike, just to prevent myself from being the ""mindless/cool with everything SP type."" I don't mean that in any pretentious sort of way, I know for some of those individuals, there's usually a bit more to it."
348,isfp,"Awesome, welcome to the community! :D I'm actually a big nerd at heart and ultimately like to stay indoors on my laptop whenever I can. Even better when friends with similar interests are with me too. The majority of us like to play video games for instance, and in my case I tend to cherry pick one that appeals to me the most and just play it for hours or days on end, exploring all the strategies, deeper meanings, endings, etc. until I finally exhaust everything there is to achieve, then take a good break before moving onto my next target of interest. Same goes for TV shows, music, YouTube vids, anime, books and so on. There's just so many options and I can't get to them, so at the very least I'll dedicate myself to one to start off with! "
349,isfp,"Oh my god that is so me. I'd play one title for days as if possessed. As if I'm chewing gum and I won't spit it out until I get the last drop of sweet juice out of it. 
Thanks for your reply it helped a lot. I hope you find your calling soon and dedicate yourself to it and achieve great things!"

351,isfp,"We are a couple of 23 y.o.in a long distance relationship for 2 years ( isfp and intj-tested, eventhough i am not a fan of  typology) and besides the fact that we only meet a few days per month, it could not be better. We both think we found the one for life genuinely and love each other (i know she does). Still, she does not want to move in with me nor can guarantee that she wants to so in the next few years, which is killing me, especially because i would move to different planets in order to be with her. On the other, not so romantic side, i don¬¥t want to waste these years until we move together just to find out it doesn¬¥t work out. I know you isfps don¬¥t handle life very strategically, but perceive the course more like a movie sometimes, and at some point i guess it would just feel right for her, and it would eventually happen. But i dont want that gamble, and i am afraid that despite her love at some point, even if we will move together, she might just feel like parting ways one day. I could never leave her anyway, though. Also, she says she is afraid of moving in together because it might ruin our relationship. I, on the other side, cant wait to  try it out and optimize living together.
I guess it is normal in that age to have commitment phobia and it will fade at some point, and i am just the oppositve in terms of planning and strategy. But perhaps i am missing something. What are your experiences with commiting anxiety? Will it change, and when? Is there some way way to accelerate that process?
Just some thoughts and perspectives that i miss would help me a lot. 
Oh and if this highly reductionistic model of personality would be as precise as most people think it is: Y¬¥all are beautiful creatures "
352,isfp,"You two need to communicate, it sounds like you've just skirted the issues at this point.

Does she take you seriously? Does she want a future with you? Even if it's not 5 years from now - you can frame it like, do you want me to be part of your life now and however far ahead you can imagine?
What are your expectations for moving in? At what point in a relationship do you consider it acceptable to live together?

a) She is likely fearful of what living together would entail. ISFPs have their whole, own little world in their homes. There might be parts of her that you don't know. For instance, I have solo dance parties in my room listening to music whenever I feel like it. This could be at 11PM. You can't really do that living with someone. Also, I'm a lot messier than I appear (I keep things tidy for guests). There are a lot fo embarrassing things that she doesn't want to be judged for, but you should take the initiative to open the conversation and put everything on the table about the fears she has and the type of ""roommate"" you will be as well. Another would be, independence and alone time. Living together, how much alone time do you expect to give each other? There are many questions to consider and facets to look into before even deciding that living together is something you want to do.
3) Being afraid of commitment doesn't necessarily mean she is not devoted to you. It may just be that she has fears of her future and can't really discuss how they relate or align with yours because she may not have them mapped out yet. She needs a partner that will ensure this is not a hinderance to the relationship and that she will be supported throughout her life path. Can a planner such as a J do this? That's up to you.
4) Finally, has your relationship ever been non-long distance? The dynamic of a LDR is vastly different and she may not want a relationship with a lot of 'we' time. Maybe she likes that your lives are separate. This I can't speculate on but it's something to explore. A lot of LDRs can end because you realize you are not right for each other and the LDR mostly just idealized the relationship and qualities of the other person."
353,isfp,"Hey, I don't know. Is there a compromise? Move within the same city / town, and ease into it? Have one visit the other if you haven't done that yet, for a week(end), and just see how it goes? I don't really know what she's anxious about (but also it's not my business).  
I'm a bit fucked, and may have fugued over a bunch of your sentences."
354,isfp,"I, too, have committment issues.
I've been with someone i deeply loved for 8years. I was 28. When it became clear that the next step was living together, sharing every moment, and starting a family, I got anxious and felt something was wrong. Moreover, I wanted to expatriate, and he didn't want to follow me.
He was good, just not the right one for me.
Now I'm in a ldr since 2ys with an intj and I am moving to his country and it sounds the best decision of all. I'm sure of what I'm doing and I don't freak out imagining a life with him.
There's a couple things: You are young. Maybe she's not ready to play family with you yet. 
Why is it implied that she has to move? What about you moving?
Also in my experience intjs tend to be a tad idealistic and impractical, specially compared to isfps. ""Everything will be alright, we will make it work..."" Except you may miss what the actual moving country and living together is like."
355,isfp,"Have a serious discussion with her about it, tell her you don't need her to decide right this second, and then give her a long timeline. She probably just needs time to think it over and decide what she wants. This part is important, though: after the discussion, don't nag her about it. Don't bring it up again for at least a month. We're like cats. we want time to decide, and if we feel you're pressuring us it's likely to just not happen. "
356,isfp,"So I'm much older, but I'm an isfp and my boyfriend is an intj and he asked me to move in (I said no and we agreed to revisit the subject in 6 months). So similar situation, but I have other things to worry about. Anyways the way you come off a bit is that this is an experiment. ""Let's move in together! I love you and I want to see what happens!"" I'm probably just projecting but moving in with someone that I want to make a life with and be with forever or at least a very long time (I wouldn't want to move in if I saw an end) is serious. When you phrase it as an experiment it doesn't feel serious (as in you won't work hard to make it work; you are just trying to see if it will work out). I hope that makes sense. "
357,isfp,"she wants a future with me and i think she talks about having children together more than i do, so thats not the problem
moving in is more about testing it out for me and i would have done it after half a year. i know her quirks and everything about her, even things you'd imagine she'd hide. we both need our alone times and give each other that time even when we could have met. idk if i could handle being with her even 50% of the time yet and she knows that i function best when i am alone and i can get restless when i am not feeling productive, so perhaps she is also afraid of me realizing i cant live in a relationship (we had a very busy family vacation once and i was just craving alone time and my independence)
of course we talked about it a lot, but it doesnt lead anywhere since she doesnt understand her own feelings (thats what she said) and it makes her sad
3) that really makes sense. i think we mesh great in the big picture and with developing next to each other. just no clue how living together would be like. i mean we talk every evening before sleep and thats the time we would have together, but just in better, basically
4) she hates the ldr state as much as i do. the idealization - idk, we share not only positive things. but it might be true, it's mostly feels like vacation when we meet
thanks a lot for your answer!"
358,isfp,"we will try out living together for a few weeks (her roommate agreed to it).
i will actually move to her country, regardless of our relationship state, she'd wouldnhave to change cities but she still wouldnt so it if i would mobe to her current city
thanks for your answer"
359,isfp,"oh that sounds bad. thats what i am afraid of, actually. i mean the chemistry is awesome and i'd say it is more than just ""a"" relationship, we have a very strong connection,  but that's what naive 22 y.o. guys would say, huh?
the idealistic thing, perhaps thats true. but im confident we would make it work. we are good at solving problema together
iahe wouldnt let me move in with her, actually"
360,isfp,"Ok well based on your response it seems like there isnt a problem, so why is she showing resistance? If she was in love with you, wanted a future with you, she'd want to take the next step. Obviously something is holding her back from agreeing to move in together. "
361,isfp,I want to help him and cheer him up. Also I want him to leave his room and stop numbing himself with videogames all the time. I try a direct approach where I told him that but it didn¬¥t help. So how can I get through to him?
362,isfp,"Don't approach him about his problem. I'd bet that he knows it exists and doesn't want anybody's help with it.  Try to lure him out with things that interest him.  Invite him out to do things that you know he'd like to do.  If you know that you're his friend then he surely cares about you, so tell him that it'd mean a lot if he did stuff with you and your buddies.  Basically just take his mind off of whatever is bringing him down without making it sound like you're only trying to make him feel better.  "
363,isfp,"As with others, I think a direct approach is/was a bad idea, i would only suggest to directly approach him if you think he seriously needs help.
what i would do to slowly get closer and try to help him is to ask if you could play video games with him. dont seem overbearing and just try to have a good time and subvertly try to make him feel better. over time keep spending time with him, find a game that you can play together, even better if it had a story type mode so you can start it together and (almost) force him to keep playing with you so you can finish it. just focus on having a good time, and if you both do, im sure he'll start to feel better. over time just drop the fact that if he needs to talk (about whatever he is down about) that he can talk to you. dont be overbearing/over reaching, thats about all the advice i have. hope it goes well for you"
364,isfp,"I know it can suck feeling useless by just not doing anything. But i'd say the best approach is just let him know you are there if he needs anything. and just leave him be, I know it may seem like he's just wasting away playing games etc. But that might be helping him take his mind off of things. "
365,isfp,"I second this one. I will almost never open up to people about my problems and bad moods, and if someone said ""let's go hang out to cheer you up"" I would probably resist. BUT sometimes something as little as going shopping at Target for some snacks or random necessities can get my mind off of things. If I feel like someone is trying to cheer me up it just makes me feel worse, but if it's simple no-pressure things then I'm more likely to relax and chill out. "
366,isfp,"I am an INTJ/INTP (it varies depending on the day--rarely more than 5% more either way) attracted to an ISFP, though I don't know the extent of her traits. She seems to pop in to my room every day to talk--we live in a dorm. She has said that my room is the only one other than hers in which she feels comfortable, and has discussed our shared introversion with me. She seems to enjoy showing me her favorite music very often, and we often stay up late at night listening to those songs. She has done small favors for me relatively frequently, but there hasn't been much, if any, physical contact. 
I may just be misinterpreting the signs--if there are any--but I am curious to see if she is interested or just being nice."
367,isfp,"Hmmm it's tough. She could equally be finding solace in you as a seen kindred spirit, or she genuinely might have an interest. I would never bother doing all that with a guy if I wasn't interested in some capacity. I'd say see how it plays out, she'll give you stronger hints if she thinks you're not getting it :P"
368,isfp,"Kind of in the same boat as you right now (posted my own thread here a while ago, and am also an INTJ). I'm having a difficult time figuring out if he's just being awfully nice to me, or if there's something else behind it. Hope it works out for ya, and hopefully more people respond so I can get advice for my own situation as well. "
369,isfp,"Of course it could vary from person to person, but I always make time for the people I like. ISFPs don't often reach out to many people. Regardless of their interest being romantic or friendly, you should take it as a huge compliment :3"
370,isfp,"Funny my homeboy and best-friend is an INTP. We don't have much in common other than we like chilling and talking about stupid shit. In fact, I'm always the one who visits and tries to interest him with my hobbies, but always ends up failing lol. He would do the same too but fails, except for schemes. We enjoy schemes and figuring out how to break the system. I think the reason ISFP enjoys INTP company is because INTP are so good at understanding and analyzing. ISFP appreciates people who understand them. Since ISFP are always misunderstood, having an INTP friend helps a lot. Especially, when things get's confusing. However, ISFP understanding of aesthetics usually will not make sense to INTP superior logical thinking. Did I mention he's a human calculator? lol My 2 cents. "
371,isfp,"Agreed. Over time she'll give stronger hints if she's attracted.
I was thinking of my own behavior, and I've acted similar ways with both people I am physically attracted to and to those I'm not. It's all about the personality, as mentioned above, the ""kindred spirit"" element is the part that makes me always want to hang out (oddly enough, they are often INTPs...). Even if I'm not physically attracted to you, if we got along perfectly, I'd totally want to hang out more, I just would never want to be physically intimate, it's tricky. But either way it goes, I end up telling the guy, either not to lead him on or because I just can't stand not trying to initiate something. "
372,isfp,"Out of curiosity I was wondering how many ISFPs use or have tried any mind altering substances. Things like alcohol, Marijuana, shrooms, acid, anything really.
Feel free to use a throwaway if you're uncomfortable answering with your main account."
373,isfp,"I was against drugs growing up, no clue what happened. I think curiosity got the best of me. 
I've done almost everything. As an ISFP who loves enjoying the moment, observing people, and being curious, here are my thoughts on mind altering substance. 
I smoke marijuana very often... a little bit too often. It makes me enjoy the moment with good friends and vibe. However, my thoughts become foggy and I start feeling self conscience when I'm in a conversation. I end up being very lazy too. 
LSD are fun at parties, but I usually become quiet and start observing everyone and everything. Feels like I'm in my own little world. Things become vivid and time feels very slow. I really enjoy this at music festivals, light shows become amazing! 
Shrooms feels very surreal and vivid. Similar to LSD. No clue what's going on, and I feel like a complete derp. Also very spiritual and psychedelic. I question everything, and I lose my grasp on time and reality. Hallucinating is pretty cool too if you have a positive imagination. Did some artwork, and it was extremely enjoyable and weird lol. Great on a hike and exploring nature with close friends. 
On MDMA I end up being more outgoing, and act like a complete different person. Makes me want to socialize and party. I become very open and lovey dovey. 
Adderall, I really enjoy it. I feel confident, motivated, and my thoughts are sharp. Great for hobby related activities and learning.
Xanax, lowers my social anxiety. More chill, ISFP timid side disappears, and less fucks given. Helps me sleep when I have anxiety before bed. 
Ketamine, eh don't really care for it. Hate being in a K-hole. Feels like being drunk and high at same time. More drunk. It was fun at first, now I lost interest in it. 
Cocaine, I've only done it a handful of times. I don't really understand it. I think it's an overrated drug. I guess I felt really excited for no reason. 
Alcohol, love and hate relationship. Love it when I get a good buzz, hate it when I get sloppy. "
374,isfp,"Occasionally drink (weddings, ballgames, etc.) and I used to smoke weed from time to time. I can't advocate for or against either, but there are other things in life I'd rather spend my money and time doing.
That said, I've always been curious about shrooms."
375,isfp,"I think that altering my mind was one of the most important things I could have experienced.  I enjoyed seeing life from a different perspective, forgetting time, and thinking thoughts that I may have never thought up otherwise.
But I think that things that change you physically, like make you physically addicted, are scarier than anything."
376,isfp,"I used to get drunk casually. If I was at a party or with some friends I would get pretty hammered. I'm kind of a ""mom"" drunk. I would just go up to all my friends and be like ""are you okay? Do you need water? You shouldn't drink anything else until you drink this cup of water. But don't drink it too fast!"" 
I've smoked weed a few times in the past, but it never really did anything....except make me throw up."
377,isfp,Haven't tried anything and don't plan on anything more than the glass of wine with a meal or with crackers/cheese/meat before holiday dinners. My dad's side is Swiss Italian and it is expected to have good wine when dining with adult company or with family. 
378,isfp,"I've only tried alcohol...I'll admit I'm curious about the other stuff but having ""Say no to drugs"" hammered so hard in childhood makes it difficult for me to want to try.  I'm afraid that I wouldn't be able to reel myself back in since I'm already so indulgent haha."
379,isfp,"I've smoked weed a few times but didn't really enjoy it that much. Edibles, on the other hand‚ÄîI had some brownies during a backpacking trip and it was fantastic. 10/10 would repeat.
Alcohol is fine, it fucks with my sleep though if I drink later in the evening. I don't like getting super drunk. I've also become a bit of a beer snob. Woohoo for moderation!"
380,isfp,"I'm a pretty frequent marijuana user, and I've had my fair share of experiences with alcohol and harder drugs (I regret my first year of University. A lot.)
Here are my thoughts:
Alcohol: I love a drink or two to clear away my inability to outwardly empathize with people I'm talking to.  Typically I come off as cold and uninterested (I'm not), but a little brain-grease has me bawling at others' sob stories, hysterically laughing at their funny stories and generally makes me more enjoyable company.  However, I have the tendency to get completely overwhelmed by everything as my drunkenness turns to tipsiness turns to sobriety.  I hate this aspect.  As I sober up I hate company.    
Marijuana: As I said, I'm a very frequent user of Buddha.  Here in Canada it's waaay cheaper than alcohol, and will last way longer for your dollar.  Recently I've been realizing the true downsides of buddha, but first let me explain why I like it so much...
It makes my thoughts totally linear, which is incredibly satisfying.  I can stay on the same exact train of thought or discussion for as long as it takes to reach the end of the subject.  This makes it great for flushing out ideas.  It also makes me much more interested in other people's lives, which is makes me great for high company.  I become fascinated with the world around me, love my cat more than I could ever think possible, and come to many important self realizations (for instance, it took buddha to help me realize I am not ISTP).  Marijuana is truly excellent, but there are downsides.  For one, it absolutely kills motivation in the real world.  I have after-burn for hours and hours after I sober up, and it makes me really uncomfortable, physically and mentally.  My joints ache and feel in need of stretching, my mind feels sluggish and unusable, and I don't feel like doing anything.  The only cure to this is really really fucking exhausting exercise and then yoga.  Unfortunately, exercise is haaaaaard.  The other main downside, which is becoming more and more horrible in my life these days, is that you learn to rely on it for relaxation and enjoyment.  Why watch a movie sober, or take a walk sober when you could smoke first?  The romantic in me is dying slowly because of my mental reliance on the drug.  I think the solution to this one is ""Just fucking be in control of yourself.""
LSD:  Like ridiculous levels of marijuana.  I've never hallucinated, but I was dead convinced I was the last man on earth for a while...  I wouldn't try this again simply due to the days of afterburn.
Shrooms:  Similar to LSD, they gave me multiple days of foggy afterburn, which I hate more than anything, so I wouldn't try them again without some kind of preventative measures.... maybe when I become a fitness junky.  However, I am truly fascinated with the spiritual side of this drug, so maybe one day.... the hallucinations can be incredibly heartwarming, terrifying, sad, etc.... they reflect your internal self to the extreme, and the make emotions intense.
And that's all, folks"
381,isfp,"Are you sure you aren't? Creativity isn't necessarily the ability to paint or write a song. There are lots of different ways to be creative, you might just have not recognized or found an outlet to express your creativity. "
382,isfp,"It's an old stereotype.  Don't sweat it.  That said, go get some cheap art supplies if you want and mess around.  100% of creatives were discouraged from something at some point in their lives (even if only by themselves) üñ§"
383,isfp,I'm very creative. I just don't use that energy for anything meaningful. I funnel most of my creative impulses into Magic the Gathering. Its a competitive card game. I like to build to a theme as opposed to just building a tier one strategy. Everyone I play with just copy pastes something they found online (which is totally fine). Meanwhile you can find me in the corner trying to reinvent the wheel.
384,isfp,"Honestly creativity can range from art to writing to research to military strageties to skating. You can find creativity almost anywhere if you look deep into it. It's just that many arts have a main focus of expressing creativity, unlike other things.
‚Äã
Also side note, not all art allows you to be creative. A lot of ISFPs focus on practical realistic peices instead of creative abstract ones (there are exceptions though)
‚Äã
Edit: Forgot how to explain creativity. My definition of creativity is to create something outside the box. or make something that barely anyone thought about. A lot of independent researchers have to be creative and figure out how to test their hypothesis while still being ethical and using enough resources in their budget. Militaries have to think of what the enemy is doing, and have to think of ways to outsmart and suprise them. Aggressive skaters come up with moves and may even create new moves to make their tricks look cool."
385,isfp,"Shoot, was doing an essay and then forgot about this
‚Äã
How I see is that S's are more aware of our surroundings, think in practical terms, using the 5 senses a lot, and tend to learn by hands-on or example rather than abstract. N's are more in their own world, think outside the box (or being creative as one would say), and tend to use abstract means to soak in infromation. 
What distinguishes us from others is what I believe is relating to socionics. I'm an ISFP with a fluxtuating N, so some days I lean more towards S while other days I tend to act more like an N. The thing with socionics is it gets easier to be consistant. I'm an SEI (ISFp) and that means that I have an introverted sensing (Si) first, which means that most of the sensing qualities are inner. So being practical, having common sense, and learning via hands-on or example. Fe comes later, but if I start explaining about it I'm going to get side-trackeed with socionics. Anyways, after that is Ni, which is why most ISFP's tend to seem creative and think outside the box. It's not as strong but it's not the inferior (last) funtion either (Te), so it's usually only found when you get to know us. But basically Ni, since it's introverted, is based off of thinking outside the box, being really spaced-out, and thinks of the future a lot. If we were Ne, (which this is the part that gets a bit confusing so bear with me here) we would be curious, want to try new things for the sake of impracticality, see possibilities and connections in a snap, and dwell in fantasies rather than futures. Then again, INFP's, which I'm assuming is what you want to distinguish for you, would just have Ni be the dominate and Si be the tertiary, so it's up to which one they can do on autopilot and which ones that thake more effort and concentration."
386,isfp,"So here's the thing about isfp.  There's not a lot of information about us because we're not only notoriously hard to pin down, we're also very private and not prone to theorizing, so we don't stand out in the way an intp or an infj would.  The data just isn't there.  You've probably found that you don't fit much of the online isfp descriptions; that's certainly true for me.  It's almost as if, and I've said this before, isfp is a catch all for those of us who don't fit anywhere else.  I think a sort of odd ball brand of creativity is one of the only generalizations that can be made about us, and most people read creativity and think art.  Like I said, though, it manifests in several different ways.  
Tbh, and slightly off topic but also to the point, I think we're hard to pin down because we maybe seem kind of... lost, especially in our younger years.  Like our identities are so important to us that we spend all this time trying to figure ourselves out, to cultivate something, and all that introspection looks a little... stupid to an outsider.  Another hallmark of isfp is feeling misunderstood, and no wonder.  We give off this vibe that's not exactly pleasant, be it stupid, shallow, or snobby, and in our own heads, it couldn't be further from the truth, but to articulate it would invite criticism and fuck that, because no one is harder on us than ourselves.  
I guess the best I can say is this.  You're in a cocoon.  Trust what emerges.  "
387,isfp,"Whoever has the gall to say something that negative to you isn‚Äôt someone you should listen to at all. Healthy, happy people don‚Äôt feel the need to put others down. I‚Äôm sure you are plenty interesting and being nice is not a bad thing at all. "
388,isfp,"To answer your question, I haven‚Äôt ever been told I‚Äôm too nice, but I‚Äôve had people criticize plenty of other things about me and wish I were more this or more that. I think our type can frustrate people because of all of our potential we hold, and all of our talents and deep thoughts we have. People see these great things and tend to want to suggest ways for you to use them best. But it‚Äôs usually not even wanted advice (our type could give fuck all what someone else thinks we should do) and can come off as rude and annoying. "
389,isfp,"I used to get this all the time when I was younger. My advice is to work on your individuality and authenticity, but also work on developing your confidence through self development books. 
After growing and developing my ""self"" I stopped getting ""boring"" and started getting comment like ""real"", ""down to earth"" sometimes even intense (I give full attention to the person I'm with)"
390,isfp,"Yeah I mean if you are letting people take advantage of you and walk all over you because you don‚Äôt want to tell people ‚Äúno‚Äù, that‚Äôs one thing, and I could see why someone might say that to you. But if you‚Äôre just a nice person, why even say that? I hope you told them to fuck off lol. Maybe that‚Äôd level out their impression of your agreeableness. "
391,isfp,"Hey, Ive always kinda liked the idea of making friends with someone online. Im from Australia so timezones could be difficult. What are your interest? I like video games and I'm studying IT. 
My opinion on INTPs are that I liked their humor at time. They seem interesting.  
19 yr old Male ISFP"
392,isfp,Middle east huh? Im guessing you dont have much nintendo then. I a pretty huge fan of Nintendo games. I love the Zelda series. I still play PC games like Minecraft and Terraria but my computer not very good so I cant run much.
393,isfp,I am definitely a strong anxious type. Unfortunately my relationships have been mostly with avoidant types as they are attracted but obviously quite difficult to have together. School of life on YouTube has some great information on attachment style. 
394,isfp,"INFP here with a new friend who I strongly suspect is ISFP. We seem to have a lot in common, however I find that our conversations seem to stop at a superficial layer. ""Oh, you care a lot about this thing too? Cool, man (cue the crickets)"" 
I am thrilled at the idea of encountering someone who seems to share a lot of my values but I'd like to be able to really sink my teeth into them, you know? Get some meaty conversation going. But the dynamic doesn't seem to be there. And so I wonder is meatyness not an ISFP thing? Or is this a common dynamic with two strong Fi's? Is this what Fi/Ni and Fi/Ne interactions look like?  Am I missing a piece? What gets you ISFPs to open up more?
Edit: Thanks for the responses! I'll be sure to keep at it in an open non-judgmental way."
395,isfp,"ISFPs are usually quite hard to get to know- we'll only have a few people that we trust. I can make small talk but I'm terrible at accomplishing anything meaningful. Coach them through it by asking them questions and giving them something to build on. We're afraid of being told our thoughts and ideas suck, so let them know you're genuinely interested in their answers and friendship and you're not a judgemental tool. Once you've made it over that barrier ISFPs make very thoughtful caring friends who will always go the extra mile for you. Just keep at it!"
396,isfp,"im a pretty private person, but i enjoy it when people show a genuine interest in something i like. so just ask why they like something or how they got into it. whenever theres crickets just expand your thoughts"
397,isfp,It's impossible for Jon to not get along with Sam but to really hear your friend sing you'll neer to hit the right cord. Your Ne-Si axe makes you a great orator to whatever your interests are. Si gives a good memory and your Ne is perfect to easily blend things together. ISFPs don't have that. So either talk about what things your friend is actively into or give her time to develop into it. (do I use into correctly? Idk)
398,isfp,"Should be able to get along well, just need to open up the Fi floodgates. Ne/Se wont see eye to eye very easily, so you might not have the same interests. The thing is, Fi resonate with personal values, so even if you have to navigate through theories to communicate, as long as you come to a holistic Fi conclusion it wont be too draining."
399,isfp,"Male INFP here. I work side by side with one of my best friends. He‚Äôs an ISFP. We have a lot of common interests. He enjoys music, I compose music. He always had that little dream about creating video games, I do too. He enjoys to draw, and I find his drawings very impressive.  
I write stories and scripts, so when I told him for the first time that I‚Äôm trying to make a video game about a story that I have, he got very excited and offered to make the drawings.
‚Äã
So now we have a common goal and I‚Äôm very excited to see what could be the maximum potential of mixed forces between ISFP and INFP. We are doing this creative project just for the fun.
‚Äã
I'm being very careful to let him draw the characters of my story according to his vision. Since he‚Äôs Fi-dom too, I think he values personal freedom as I do. Right?"
400,isfp,"Imo creativity flourishes with restrictions. Restrictions not in a controlling sense, but more of a jumping off point. Challenges are stimulating!
So yes, give your friend creative space, but don't be afraid to bounce ideas back and forth. Working with someone who has no opinions is boring, might as well be working alone"
401,isfp,"Yesss, if you try to limit him or corner him in any way, you just might drive him away or make him uncomfortable or lose passion in the project, I think. At least from personal experience but I'm no expert."
402,isfp,"Idk, I was just thinking about stuff. I‚Äôve never really been super confident, but I think I mask it pretty well, and can even seem outgoing and bubbly at times. I don‚Äôt really complain to others often, but I think at my core I‚Äôm pretty negative about stuff, my life especially. What about y‚Äôall? How self confident are you? How do others seem to perceive your energy? Etc"
403,isfp,"Oh yeah. I'm shy, awkward, trip over my words all the time, very self deprecating with a huge case of imposter syndrome. But when it comes to it, I can absolutely act confident. Like in job interviews or giving presentations. I can blag those things really easily. Which probably contributes massively to the imposter syndrome. 
I guess others can perceive me as being quite warm and kind when I'm having a good day. But either way, being myself or acting confident, I can sometimes come off as being abrupt or aloof or even arrogant which does ruffle some feathers."
404,isfp,"I think everyone have the realistic side of them that would be considered pessimistic, but you‚Äôd lose (in life) if you always give in to that kind of thought. Living like that is also very boring imo so I learned to hype myself up. Probably due to my short temper whenever I think less of myself and feel that other people also think I wont succeed I get the fire burning in my heart saying ‚Äúyea? Well fuck you I will do it and show you whats up‚Äù and thats my motivation. You‚Äôll be surprised what you can achieve if only you give yourself a chance, even if you dont end up achieving your goal you would still have gone further than you have expected. Through those achievements and experiences you gain confidence, the feeling is very solid and not a pretense.  "
405,isfp,"Me too, whoah. Especially with job interviews and stuff, I naturally come across as very warm and friendly but I‚Äôm definitely pretty aloof when I‚Äôm keeping to myself. I feel like some days I‚Äôll be supernaturally outgoing and can talk to everyone and be completely social, and other days, I‚Äôll be withdrawn and overly self conscious even around my closest friends, and then immediately take a nap or something once I‚Äôm finally away from everyone lol."
406,isfp,"Hey everyone, 
So a little bit about me. I'm 27 years old. I am an EMT out in southern California. I previously worked for a mortgage bank for 5 years. Near the end of my time at the bank I began to lose interest in my work because of how little growth I was experiencing. 
Working as an Emt is nice. I get to interact with people during their time of need, however it's not a very financially viable option for a long term career. Despite how fulfilling it is, I'm constantly thinking about what I want to do in the future. 
My question to you all is, how did you all find your careers? Did you stumble upon them, or did you know exactly what you wanted to do and pursued it?"
407,isfp,"I tried different things (some of which i liked) that i used as a base knowledge and to understand what i was better at, and then went for something that allows me to keep exploring new skills and learn new things so that not only i can grow inside my profession, but i can change career if the situation called for it. Maybe this is not my final job but i'll get all i can from it."
408,isfp,"My girlfriend an ISFP struggles as well, don't worry. She first went to college for electrical engineering, decided she didn't care for that, flirted with a minor in programming, also decided it wasn't quite for her, settled with a degree in accounting for its practicality (at the least, should easily find a job even if she doesn't enjoy it) and because she didn't want to keep switching majors. All the meanwhile, she had jobs at fast food, in construction, on an assembly line under a microscope making medical parts, and at Mernards, finally now working as an accountant...for now. As far as hobbies goes, she likes crafting things, sometimes drawing or painting, but typically crochet, duct tape, and sometimes wood projects. She sorta plays with the idea of starting an Etsy shop, if only she could consistently make stuff. Just an aside, but I value her handiness compared to me, she does most house projects. I'm just pointing that out to say that you can offer value in many things just by acquiring skills from odd jobs. 
I don't think you guys are suited for traditional ""careers"" in the sense that you'd be fixed in a certain realm doing more or less the same things, just with different titles attached. Just my opinion, I believe you'll be happiest simply applying yourself to wherever your present interests are without necessarily worrying about the future. Once something stops being interesting, move on to whatever else currently fancies you. At worst, hopefully you find yourselves a more traditional ""stable"" partner that'll keep you afloat as you transition. "
409,isfp,"I just took what I enjoyed. I am a Physiotherapist, and I got to that by knowing I like biology, I found human anatomy and physiology very interesting. Then I also like helping people. So I looked at all tge careers with these and physiotherapy was a good fit. On that note I also love making food and thought about chef, so I started doing that a lot and I started enjoying it less so I realised I dont want to kill that joy by making it a job. I think for me it has to be something I enjoy and that has a reward in people, getting rid of pain or increasing someones function is a great reward. Unless money is what gives you a sense of accomplishment then dont try look at how much you will make, first look at what will inspire you to actually work everyday. Good luck. Dont rush it. You will find the right career. "
410,isfp,"I'm actually currently struggling with the exact same thing as you.
My entire life, from as young as I can remember, my answer to, ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"", was always the same: Veterinarian (which eventually changed to Veterinarian Technician when I found out what that was.)
I then found myself with an amazing opportunity when I was 18 to be trained hands-on as a Vet Tech, while getting paid to do so. It was a crazy dream come true at the time, I couldn't believe I had achieved my life's goal straight out of high school.
Then I realized I was actually quite depressed, and I didn't have the passionate I thought I would as a Vet Tech. 
While working as a technician, I continued to work a second job at the restaurant where I've been working since I was 16(I'm now 20). I quit the clinic and went to work full time at the restaurant, which I'm still currently doing.
The pay is decent, I get good hours, and the people I work with are my family. I'm content with this right now, but I'm also becoming restless and feel like I need to start figuring out what I want to do long term. Which is a terrifying thought for me because I don't even know where to start.
Good luck OP, I truly hope that you can figure out what makes you happy and gives you a fulfilling life."
411,isfp,"Have you ever looked into becoming a physician assistant?
Its a two year masters degree program, you essentially see patients one on one like a provider would, but can‚Äôt be employed independently without an MD.
PA programs require patient contact experience to be admitted, and you‚Äôd be able to use your EMT hours towards that. Just a thought:)"
412,isfp,"I know that I genuinely enjoy helping people. As an EMT, I love knowing that I can make someones worst day a little brighter by having good bed side manners. 
However, I've also discovered about myself that I work best when I work individually. I enjoy the autonomy of having a task at hand and using problem solving skills to find a resolution. 
As far as a passion, I don't know how to answer that question yet. I've had a difficult time answering that question. I was never asked that question growing up, so I'm finding it difficult to ask myself now. "
413,isfp,"hm... i think the first one feels worse because that's like an ""attack"" against me. whereas ignoring me i tend to give the benefit of the doubt or i can shrug it off because i don't/won't really know what really happened(?), if that makes any sense."
414,isfp,"I can handle criticism pretty well, and though it gets me down, I can get something meaningful out of it. Someone ignoring me just makes me feel unwanted, but I don't take it personally - healthy boundaries and expectations are important."
415,isfp,"Uhhh both? Ignoring hurts more initially, criticism hurts forever/for longer.
Being ignored usually hurts more in the moment - I'm alone with my thoughts and all I can think about is how they hate me, how awful I am, worrying about why they're ignoring me, etc... While if somebody directly criticizes me I usually get swept up in that and trying to argue against it or talk about what I did that makes them say that, my focus is so much on the discussion/talking about the criticism in hypothetical terms, it's not yet turned inwards/'about me'.
I'll forget about them ignoring me the next time we talk though, so long-term it makes no difference. The criticism on the other hand will stay with me forever and I'll constantly be seeking reassurance about it, belittling myself over it, worrying about it's accuracy, long after the other person and I have resolved the situation."
416,isfp,It's worse when they ignore you because it leaves questions hanging and unresolved. Being harshly criticized can be hurtful but it's a step towards resolving whatever tension existed that lead to the criticism in the first place. 
417,isfp,"Ignoring, because that kind of indicates that they don't care anymore. If they harshly criticize you, there's typically some sort of fear or insecurity on their end toward you that they don't know how to address healthily, and once you rationalize it out with them you realize it wasn't a huge deal in the first place and that it just showed they cared a lot (assuming they're reasonable people? Haha). 
But at the same time, being ignored can be a little better because you can just kind of accept that you don't know what happened and that you can't control it. Regardless, both are definitely very hurtful and I try my best to avoid these as an ISFP too!"
418,isfp,"I tend to need harsher criticism than people will give me. I find that though it might hurt my feelings I don't grow without someone pushing me hard. So I actually enjoy it when people I trust criticize me properly. But if its someone I don't know/trust/respect then I get hurt more long term. 
However if someone I love ignores me then I am really hurt. "
419,isfp,"If you ignore me then I'm like .... next. Unless you're romantic/family , of course. 
Harsh criticism is in the eye of the beholder. If another person starts making it personal than, yeah, it can sting. But if it's legit than it might bother me but I'll take it to heart and keep what I think is appropriate, "
420,isfp,"I'm the same, I try and think of all criticism as constructive and work with it. A delay in replying to my text/call and not feeling rejected is something I have to work hard to achieve. (This is supposed to be my distraction right now)"
421,isfp,"By express, I mean with words
I feel as though I am often stuck in my head during conversations. Especially during social conversations with family, SOs, and sometimes friends. I hold back, and sometimes it's something that I don't realize that I do because I feel like I have done it my whole life. I've noticed that my ""submissiveness"" has become an issue when people try to get to know me, such as my boyfriend. I want to change this habit of my personality. 
How do you ISFP's deal with expressing the thoughts in your mind? 
Or am I just alone on this o_o"
422,isfp,"Yes, like rainpoppy said, when i'm with people i'm thinking ""i should say this, right?"" but i never do it, so, if it's important i write it down by mail or something afterwards.
And i will drop this here coz w/e, alcohol helped me too, like you get drunk a few times, you speak your mind and then, it isn't that difficult even sober  :D
pd: not an alcoholic"
423,isfp,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahaha
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahehe

You don't. 
I'm just kidding. I find it's something you have to work out. Step by step, take a risk and just say what's on your mind. Not all at once of course, and only with people you're comfortable around. Then take more risks and express yourself greater and with different people. I think most of us ISFPs are in the same boat as you so don't feel alone. :)"
424,isfp,"The thing that's the hardest for me to verbalize is my emotions. When I get hit with a particularly large wave of emotions, it usually takes me at least a few hours to think through them and organize my thoughts. I find it super helpful to go to a comfortable place (my bed) and just relax and think. Then when I talk to my SO, I can be confident and know exactly what I want to say."
425,isfp,"Yep this works. You'll realize when you start asserting yourself it isn't as bad as you thought it was going to be, then you can do it more often. It helps if you take a driver's seat approach and start paying more attention to everything, so you actually notice things that you can be assertive about. Instead of just being all laid back and cool about everything."
426,isfp,"I repeat the thing in my head too. I hate it when I do that, but I can't stop myself from doing it most of the time. Sometimes it works when I remind myself that the listener wants to hear what I have to say, especially if they're close friends or an SO. When it comes to work-related people, I'm more assertive because I want to make sure I get the job done right."
427,isfp,"I recently took a Mind-Body Health class offered by our health insurance. One of the best takeaways for me was the Positive Self Affirmation exercises. Look it up. 
My favorite: ""It's ok to assert yourself for things you care about"" 
You basically tell yourself that over and over, and soon you kind of find yourself believing and doing it."
428,isfp,"No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ISFP personality type? Instead of ‚Äútraits or characteristics‚Äù that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. "
429,isfp,"Usually I start off by explaining functions. Then I often offer examples from my life to illustrate Fi and Se. Each of our functions are filtred through Fi. Our Ni and Te are good examples of the flawed versions of these functions.
Fi - I am constantly aware of myself and constantly wondering if I am doing the right thing, if I am being supportive enough, if I am being interesting enough. It takes a lot of place. Fi also makes us FEEL what is right and what is wrong. It is subjective, therefore it can be wrong, and since it's just a deep feeling, it can be hard to understand, even for yourself. It also makes me feel for individuals. It makes me aware of individuals and their feelings rather than social conventions. Since Fi is about values and morality, it's what makes us want to be good and supportive people. Sometimes we don't have the words to help, but we always want to help. Especially the people we love. It can make us self-sacrificing, but since it's an ebb-and-flow function, it can also make us very cold at times, when we feel betrayed.
Se - Combined with Fi, it makes me aware of every single person around me. But it's also what naturally prevents me from going for conflict or words that could make someone sad, especially when facing the person, because I will feel how hurt someone can be. (we are tuned both to people's feelings and our environment) Se also makes me observant of sensory details. It enables me to enjoy going for a run, sports and beauty in nature for itself. It's a good, objective counterpart to Fi. It allows me to be nonjudgmental and to appreciate all the differences and qualities in each person. Fi+Se make us naturally good with art, because it gives us a good sense of a beauty that can convey perfectly our feelings, without having to put words on it. None of our main functions are functions of language, which is why we have trouble putting our thoughts into words. Art is our way out. It's also the reason why we love animals and children. They are simple beings that are not molded and repressed by society or morality itself.
Ni - It allows me to link things to get to a conclusion. Since it's not especially good, it can both be too idealistic or too negative, depending on my mood. It makes me see a future way too bright or way too dark. For example, I tend to idealize people I just get to know based on little information I have of them. I extrapolate, often in a wrong way. If I do not sort things out with Se, that is, with external, objective data, I also tend to be extremely negative about myself and my future. Se is very important for us as it helps us make sure we are making concrete moves to be morally good people according to our standards. Ni is ONE conclusion. It's because of this function that we can make the wrong conclusions about what people think of us. (One of my best friends is ISFP and sometimes she is sure I am mad at her or I am sure she is sad when really none of this is happening. Most of our conflicts happen because of misunderstandings. I also get mad about her not talking things out when I see her being in a bad mood or because she did not ask me to do something out of fear of bothering me even though we've known each other for nearly 10 years; or I explode after keeping something to myself for a long time because I primarly thought I was just interpreting things and then got further proofs for this idea that I could not get off my mind on my own. Then by talking about it I realize it was really just me interpreting things... sigh)
Te - Sometimes I can take the lead and order around, for the sake of efficiency (for not any less than two seconds). Usually though, Te manifests itself when we get angry. When our values are wronged, we can get extremely factual and cold, but since it's a flawed version of Te, filtred through Fi+Ni, our anger can be unjustified and too harsh.
Our biggest challenge is to be able to accept things as they are, others and ourselves. To use Se, accumulate data and experiences, instead of just being constantly in Fi-mode. It's also to force ourselves to communicate about what goes wrong instead of ruminating it by ourselves. 
There you go! Do not hesitate if you have questions. I might have made it sound a little bad because I think it's important for us to face our flaws. But Fi+Se can be awesome ! Because of this combination I love hearing about people's passions or joyful events because I can see how bright it makes them. And I am able to enjoy very specific things about people that make them happy, remember them and use it to make them happy again later ;)"
430,isfp,"Hello! INFP, like Ne-doms or Ne-aux, create naturally their own worlds. I think ISFP need experiences and data to make their worlds work, if it has to be put into words. I actually hanged out with two ENTP and one INFP several days ago, it was incredible and really fun. Their imaginations have no boundaries! This is why INFP are known to be writers. Just like we convey our feelings through art to make them tangible, they write them down through their own worlds to convey them metaphorically.
INFP tend to be I think much more open-minded to spiritualism and other options because of Ne. It does not need to be concrete or logical. Us ISFP tend to have to see things from a logical, grounded standpoint. (even though our point of view is generally not nearly as logical as we think it is)
I personally love drawing! I am a freelance illustrator. I also love reading and sharing thoughts and theories with my friends. And I love going for a run and sports get me energized. But my best friend who is ISFP generally does not like sports. We ISFP tend to dwell on fiction because it's an easy way to make Fi+Se work without having to deal with the pressure of going out with people. I realized hanging out with several friends is a nice way of getting to know people without having to talk all the time hahaha. ISFP enjoy being observers to learn from the world! INFP tend to be much more talkative, because their minds are always making connections.
You said you write songs. What do you enjoy most and what comes more naturally to you, making the music or writing the lyrics? That might be a good track :D"
431,isfp,"I think we Fi-doms are really uncomfortable sharing our emotions even though we feel a lot which is why we tend to transplant them into art or fictional worlds. It allows us to express them without having to feel like we need any justification or explanation behind them, something that is difficult for us to do.
Art teachers are inspired a lot by artists, and most artists have an explanation for their worlds, or have been studied so much that their worlds are openly explained. I know it puts boundaries and explanations where it feels unecessary at times, but I think it's a good training for ISFP, since we are not at ease with translating ourselves into words. Maybe you can try making your explanations ambiguous, so as to not put any limits on what you convey. Sometimes just giving hints to several directions can be good enough for people.
Singing and drawing do not come entirely naturally to anyone. Drawing, in the sense of being able to draw things that exist, requires hours and hours of work. We have just a strong sense of details and we know how to make things pleasing to the eye, which probably means we learn this kind of hands-on work faster. The important thing is to never give up! "
432,isfp,"I keep seeing INFPs talk like their eyesight is handicapped and not able to see the world around them, while ISFPs boast about being very in the moment.
However, I don't really feel like I belong to either group, anyone else like that?"
433,isfp,"I agree. It's hard for me to understand what being ""in the moment"" means. Maybe because we're bad at viewing things from other perspectives that makes it hard for us to compare our inner world with others?"
434,isfp,"Don't know if it is my anxiety, but when I took driving lessons, I felt like I wasn't in my body. It was so difficult to visualize the width of the car and I almost hit a side mirror on a parked car. Also, I went to Costco today with my Mom and I was so scared of bumping into people while pushing the cart. But when I'm alone, I feel like my senses are boosted a million-fold. "
435,isfp,"Yes I am.
‚Äã
and I don't know what descriptions mean when they talk about ""living in the moment"" and ""aware of the environment"", but I saw a lot of ISFPs and a couple of INFPs to differentiate between them, and I noticed that:  
ISFPs usually are into certain physical activities. They are the ones who are more likely to enjoy exercising manual skills. things like art crafts, mechanical repairing of something, cutting hair, etc. Not only ISFPs, but also my ISTP brother is better than me at drawing, although he never practiced and I do it for years.
‚Äã
According to what I saw: ISFPs tend to be inclined to the more artistic side of manual skills, like (painting, drawing, singing) while ISTPs tend to go towards the ""puzzle side"" of manual skills, something you can ""solve"", like building a chair, repairing a computer, fixing a clock, etc.
‚Äã
But, there are common territories to ISFPs and ISTPs. That is, they some have manual ability: I know a lot of ISFPs and a some ISTPs. An ISFP friend of mine is good repairing his bike and knows a lot of it. an ISTP acquaintance is studying painting. Maybe it's not that they have skill, but that they are interested in those activities. So they learn and become better at some point.
‚Äã
Now, what I could see about INFPs and ISFPs in real life give me some hints. This can be subjective and insufficient. I have little experience gathered, but what I see is that INFPs tend to be more inclined to the SP instinctual variant, while ISFPs tend to be more open to the people, talks, world. Honestly, INFPs I know may look a little like INTJs, they could even look like thinkers at first glance, while ISFPs may look warmer, less distant, and less quiet. Remember that this is only my subjetive opinion, based on what little I saw.
‚Äã
Another thing I would like to say. INFPs and ISFPs can look really good if they can choose what to wear. But there is a thin dividing line. The difference may be that, ISTPs and ISFPs may have some more ""visual power"". That is to say that they might look good for aesthetics. The problem here is that Fi ruins this claim. Fi may have its own fashion. ISFPs may look aesthetically bad if they want to get it. Let's say that, ISFPs can look better and worse than INFPs can. It depends on what the ISFP want to transmit.
Instead, INFPs may seem like a little more indifferent to clothes. Male INFPs are more prone to ""wear so you do not go naked"" style.
‚Äã
and also, in art, ISFPs tend to make art going more to the aesthetic. what it mean? they are the ones who are more likely to have ""cool drawings"" about monsters or insects or beautiful persons, and things like that. they are more capable to appreciate the visual thing as something complete in itself. While INFPs usually support their ideas in sensory ways. I myself see drawing as a mean to convey an idea. I see it as an accessory, not as the main thing of my creation.
‚Äã
I would never dedicate myself to draw a 1 hour drawing just to finish with a ""cool drawing"" that does not represent anything of me. but I saw many ISFPs that draw much more beautiful things than mine, with better technique, and much better than mine, with without a meaning.
‚Äã
comparing myself with an ISFP friend. We both study visual arts. My drawings have a narrative context that manifests itself visually. I narrate a little story about someone or something. I get involved with internal questions and philosophical statements.
‚Äã
When my ISFP friend want's to give a meaning to his drawings, he usually takes a metaphor of some of the songs he likes and draws it. If the song is called the shadows that drowns me, he draw a shadow drowning someone. And he does it well."
436,isfp,"In the moment means being more externally aware and grounded. They can still be oblivious, but they‚Äôre just more present in their surroundings, if that makes sense. It‚Äôs the opposite of living more in one‚Äôs head, the opposite of seeing deeper implications to everything. "
437,isfp,"I think i'm quite good at realising when i'm tuned into my surroundings; or if i'm deep in thought/rehearsing conversations, and my mental attention has drifted away from sensory/physical things.  
like the poles of hyper-focus. one is alert and responsive. the other is caught in a daydream, or turning over ideas/working through problems (without physical/external stimuli).  
i hope that makes some sense. sorry if it's just soporific shit."
438,isfp,"My worst days of depression are behind me. Am I healthier, no but I'm getting there with a therapist.  My worst year I didn't take a day off work, no vacation and no personal days. I did this bc if I stayed home I would've killed myself. I had friends helping me from close by and from states away. They called me and checked up on me. They also got me out of the house doing things I would normally wouldn't do. They help me as much as I let them. And soon my thoughts of suicide weren't as strong. Now I've been seeing a therapist for over 6 months feel a little better but not quite there yet. It's a work in progress."
439,isfp,"it was really a process of small steps, first therapy, that motivated me to get anti-depressants, those motivated me to exercise, and exercise motivated me to take back my life- i‚Äôm much happier now and have the energy to do what i love that i never thought i would get back"
440,isfp,"I just left my job because it was ruining my mental health, but I have definitely had worse days. 2-3 years ago was a lot worse - I was struggling at college and ended up dropping out, didn't have a lot going for me either. I was in awful shape, borderline anorexic with very poor eating habits. I have always struggled with this even when I was very young. not sure why but it took a long time to break these habits. I'm in pretty good shape now, but still have a way to go to fix everything related to my issues w/ food and body image. It used to feel like a daily struggle, now more like every week or so I'll have some issues come up but I can mostly ignore them and they'll go away. 
in regards to school I was never a good student, never learned how to actually do multiplication or division so my math skills have always been very poor. when I graduated HS and decided to go to community college I had a very hard time, tried tutoring multiple times and different methods, but I just could not do it. I tried to get the classes waived(they were just gen. ed. requirement courses I needed to get an associates degree) and replaced with something else. meanwhile I had like a 3.7 gpa, was getting As in high level foreign language classes but there was nothing I could do about the math- and the college didn't care. 
so I quit at a certain point and was doing very poorly in terms of mental health and with my depressive feelings. I really felt hopeless, I had very little work experience, was constantly fatigued due to my health, felt like an idiot for not being able to pass what was apparently easy math, etc. I ended up finding a sales job somewhere, things got a little better and I decided to try college again. gave up less than a year later, I just decided it wasn't going to work no matter what. I couldn't do it and there was no point in wasting my time on it. since then I've just been working different jobs, trying to find something that I like and that'll stick. so far I haven't had much luck, I liked my last job but I live too far away now and it wouldn't be worth commuting there. my current job isn't that bad, but my schedule was shit and wasn't improving, so I decided to put my 2 weeks notice in the other day because I felt awful. It was graveyard shift and staying up for so long just ruined how I felt. at my last job I was actually happy, this one just made me feel like killing myself or something
so now I'm thinking I need to start doing things to enjoy life more, like draw more and maybe start swimming, doign things I genuinely enjoy because I have felt so cramped and forced into the wrong sized box for years. I guess I'm going to sign up for a course in something, probavbly graphic design because I genuinely enjoy art and I feel like it's not something you can really get wrong the same way you can math or science. at this point in my life I just don't care enough to be right about stuff, I have never been good at that stuff and should focus on other stuff where it doesn't matter if I can divide or multiply numbers or whatever. 
I don't know - a lot is on my mind right now and I feel like I need space and time to think about it, look at my situation from another perspective and be honest with myself about my failures and successes to help find the right thing to do. I also need to let go of my failures and not let them harm my current life, nobody cares about my past other than myself but I have such a hard time letting go of it"
441,isfp,"Note: I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with depression but I will say that I was ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù for a period of time. 
Well I had been really lonely during the school holidays (last year), only seeing people other than my family 2 days a week.  Even when the school term had started I hadn‚Äôt really gone out with friends after school as I‚Äôd just catch the bus home. That‚Äôs how it kinda started. 
I don‚Äôt remember much in the middle of the main part of my depression, but I do remember how I started to get better. 
Spontaneously my parents decided for our family to go out of the city to a small town staying over at a friends house for the long weekend. I remember me HATING this at first, but a couple hours after we arrived I decided I didn‚Äôt want to feel this emotion of sadness anymore. So I stopped listening to songs that made me sad, stopped using social media unless I needed to. During that long weekend I had also stopped playing games that made me angry or upset if I lost. 
After that long weekend I felt a bit more in control of my feelings. A week or so after I went back to school and started to focus a lot more school. (Even though I didn‚Äôt care about maths) which ended up with me having A‚Äôs in two of my subjects. (Which I was aiming for) I think this was also the time my ex and I had liked each other. So finding out that someone else had liked me had some comfort and reassurance as ISFP‚Äôs generally need. 
Sure it wasn‚Äôt all that smooth but that‚Äôs the General gist of things. 
Anyways, hope you all have a good day! 
Ps, if you didn‚Äôt have a good day I hope tomorrow can be better!"
442,isfp,"You've framed this as a personal failing - but while 'nobody cares', these anxieties are more likely social than personal. It's hammered into you (in a complex, modern world) explicitly, with ""if you don't do this, you'll never be that""; implicitly, e.g. with the gravity given examinations.
It's no wonder there's pervasive neuroses, dread, shame.  
(I think/hope) as you begin to set your own expectations borne of your own talents/volition, the old socially loaded expectations will be supplanted, as they cease to serve a purpose/have meaning in your life.  
Thanks for sharing - I related a lot to your comment."
443,isfp,"thanks for the reply, I agree with that. I feel like I struggle to fit into society and find a place for myself in it in general. I think when I was younger I had an easier time being myself, and it has gotten harder as I try to align myself with stuff that I can't relate to.  a lot of times i have thought that I'd like to fit in and be ""normal"" but I probably just won't, my upbringing alone wasn't normal and might have been the start of why I don't feel this way, but it has always felt more natural to just operate on what feels right to myself rather than what's expected.
I think my idea that doing things differently not being feasible financially or socially is probably wrong too, just another worry that I have because it seems like people are told to do things as they're done or to follow a certain plan. that plan has not worked for me though, so I guess doing things in an unusual, unique and individual way is worth trying"
444,isfp,"There's a bunch of talking points here that I feel not well enough to do proper justice. But I'll try to feel a couple out.  
Yeah, I remember when i was younger, it was easier to inhabit a sort of form-fitting sphere, but with age, increased responsibility, the sense of the weight of the world (and one's future within it)‚Äîit grows larger, more unwieldy.  
But if you've had social or isolation issues with your upbringing (I don't know), it can be difficult to develop a sense of self, as your social reference point is lost. Your identity gets sort of fuzzy, indistinct.  
I think you can learn a lot just by being around others. It's not easy (as you surely know). A lot of it will be unconscious, mirroring, etc. I think a lot of (other) people just want someone who understands them for a moment, so time feels shared in communion rather than something unbalanced, unrelatable.
Sure - try things out and see what works! Most people do have to compromise to some extent. But it gets easier with practice/exposure. If it works out, you get a bit of leverage (e.g. with money, or favours from friends).  
Personally, I get better at dealing people, but still feel like an impostor most of the time. And I'm shit with authority. Things get a little easier every year."
445,isfp,"Thanks for the reply. I'm giving myself some time to think about stuff so I don't do anything in a rush(or without evaluating everything), but then I'll try making the next step for myself in terms of career. not sure what that will be yet.
socially I don't think I have any big issues, I used to be more shy wehn I was younger but recently kind of stopped caring. it's been a while since I've hung out w/ anyone I didn't know but the last few times I did were fun. I was different in how I talked to people(lots of weird and dumb jokes, I guess) and it seemed like a  few people enjoyed that. so I think I enjoy just letting myself be free in those situations, don't really feel a need to be the same as others(if I try this I just won't say anything for the most part)."
446,isfp,"Yeah, I'm the same pretty much. Definitely in my mid-twenties I hit that stopped caring phase. I remembered today that I wrote a similar comment to that first one (I guess it's a subject I'm preoccupied with.)  
Hope things turn out alright for you. I think there's always hope as long as you care about other people. Good luck!"
447,isfp,"I have absolutely. I am just slightly more introverted than extroverted. What sold me on it was that after I left work from being extroverted all day, I wanted to go home and be by myself. Like, I got so excited about being by myself I would basically jump up and down with joy. 
I love interaction, but I prefer a very small group when doing it. 
I also do not sit in the middle when I‚Äôm going to lunch with a large group. If you sit close to the wall, you‚Äôre probably introverted. "
448,isfp,"I have moments where I feel extraverted because I like people, make friends easily, and will frequently initiate conversations. But at the end of the day, I get really tired after talking a lot.
For example, I hadn't been to my old church in two years and two weeks ago I visited. When I was in the parking lot, I saw someone I knew immediately who greeted me before I could get in the building. I saw three more people right after that, who I allotted roughly five minutes of conversation apiece. After that, I continued to run into someone I knew every few steps who I also gave 3-5 minutes of conversation. At a certain point, I just put my head down and power walked toward the building because the relentless emotions of reuniting with casual acquaintances followed by small talk became overwhelming. The service was fine and gave me time to unwind, followed by more conversations. I was mentally exhausted that night.
I'm going back to that city this next week for a wedding and a small part of me is considering not attending that church again, which I dearly love, solely because it feels like I have my 'social fill' of my friends from there and I'm worried about another parking lot situation. I probably will go still, but I am having those introverted feelings, haha!"
449,isfp,"Here‚Äôs my experience:
I will reliably be  ‚Äúextroverted‚Äù, which is assertive and enthusiastic, when I‚Äôm intoxicated. 
I will sometimes be extroverted when I‚Äôm with close friends, and I‚Äôm the ‚Äúfunny one‚Äù of the group, or the one who leads the group towards goals or i can sense that the vibe is not positive enough. 
I will rarely be extroverted when I‚Äôm the ‚Äúless funny one‚Äù, when the vibe is naively positive and/or overly structured or suppressive. 
To call yourself an introvert would mean that in the infinite amount of situations you have encountered, (supposedly captured by the binary questions asked on the MBTI test), you will more likely than not (<50% of the time) exhibit introverted behavior across your entire life span. 
I think this entire subreddit, as well as the MBTI community in general, can benefit from the mindset that we naturally and must continue to stretch our default temperaments. Trying to explain yourself an ‚Äúextrovert‚Äù is only useful as a momentary gauge of your behavior as an adaptation to succeed in your social environment. Understand that both extroverted and introverted behaviors are morally neutral and inevitable consequences each of us having an internal and external life. Both introverts and extroverts are paired with equally successful life outcomes as well as self reported well being, so it‚Äôs wrong to assume either is better. 
In general, good luck extracting anything useful from MBTI. I remember swearing by it, and realizing it was not serving me, so I began reading into Big 5 personality dynamics where I found a more cohesive understanding of human personality. "
450,isfp,"I am always aware of how i look and what I‚Äôm saying, and I‚Äôm constantly insecure over it. I also remember almost every time I‚Äôve been insulted and still think of it.  I was insulted years ago, someone said i had teeth like spongebob and now i think of it every time I open my mouth. I take insults really hard and if someone gives me criticism, even if I ask for it, I find it hard not to burst into tears, and most of the time I do. How do I stop taking everything so personally and hard? "
451,isfp,"I get annoyed as well however I forget about them very quickly. Whenever someone insults me I say to myself that they're not okay, cause normal people don't insult others for no reason. What I love doing is giving people compliments after they insult me. Their reactions are beautiful. "
452,isfp,"Yeppp, I can relate. I can handle gentle constructive criticism (‚Äúhey, this is pretty good! But you might want to fix this...‚Äù), but if someone directly criticizes me, I get my little spirit crushed lol. Overtime, I‚Äôve started just blocking out the majority of my negative emotions, though, because I‚Äôm not good at dealing with them, so I‚Äôve started at least pretending criticism/insults don‚Äôt bother me...:)"
453,isfp,"Whoever said that about your teeth must really have a psychological problem. They certainly said that to attack you and make you feel down, making them feel a whole lot better about themselves. It seems the problem lies with them, not you. There are times when they do feel like personal attacks, but we don't have to take it that way. You can either choose to forget and ignore it or consider it in a positive way or action for your self benefit. Like while looking into the bathroom mirror, ""My Spongebob teeth look hella fine on me. Who cares what anyone else says. No one else can pull that off better than me. *smiles""  You could even have been the better person and thanked them for the compliment. I think Spongebob's teeth are actually cute tbh. He takes extra attention and care of them and are usually, always pearly white. Spongebob isn't Spongebob without those nice teethes of his. You really shouldn't let things like that get to your head unless you truly believe them to be. 
I know that there are times even when it's hard and I can't take those things in well or it doesn't sit well with me. But I try not to let it get me down and bother me. I don't want those things to weigh me or drag me down in any negativity form long term. Don't give in to the pain forever because you can be so much better than that. Those things do not define who I am. I know what I am. Sometimes, I ponder and try to see the meaning behind said things. Why did they say those things to me? What do I need to improve on if I do see where they are coming from? What could I do differently to overcome this? Does this person even know or are aware of what they're saying? If they just want to make themselves feel better, ignore them if you can. But if they criticize you and want to help support you by telling you what things to improve on, you can take that as someone who is trying to help you better yourself in a good way, not that they want to look down on you or anything like that.  Sometimes I just need a little time or space to make me alright again. Even a quiet, comforting hug will do or talking to someone about it can help ease the burdening weight. A person once told me not to take things too personally to heart and I'm still learning ways to take what that caring person said, to heart. It really boils down to how you take it in. These things are inevitable and just takes some time and how you go about treating the conflicting issue. 
I hope that this will make you feel better, can be an eye opener for you and possibly help you in some ways. =) "
454,isfp,"I don't believe you will be able to help it honestly as you have Te inferior, This will make you sensitive to the thoughts of other people. It also might make you indecisive, ineffective in bringing your goals to fruition, ineffective of organizing your environment in the way you want. It's just part of your inferior, it will most likely be something you inspire to improve on throughout your life. My sister is an INFP and she has Te inferior I've observed her behavior and have noticed these trends."
455,isfp,"Since we're all artists in one way or another, I thought it might be fun to talk about our artistic outlets.
I'll go first, to break the ice. I love music. Listening to it, finding more of it, making my own... I'm an amateur DJ so I frequently make alternate recordings/remixes of songs I like. But for the most part I like just listening to it. My current favorite album is The Resistance by Muse. I found it 2 or 3 days ago? Maybe? I don't know? I always lose track of the days when I'm buried in music. My parents don't understand how I can sit here in front of my computer all day JUST listening to music. There's soooo much out there that needs to be listened to! Anyways, yea I can't stop listening to that whole album. The first few times almost brought me to tears because I can relate to a few of the songs, and because it sounds really pretty too. Music is one of those few things I can get talking about, and have the conversation flow fairly smoothly.
So what do you like to do to satisfy your artistic side? Draw? Music stuff? Write in the comments, or PM if you want to..."
456,isfp,"I'm also into music. It's a really interesting medium and I love to fascinate myself with new sounds that I'm not normally accustomed too. I like to listen to a lot of different genres and sub-genres, but I tend to go through different phases of what I'm drawn to listen to. Right now I've been really into a broad spectrum of electronic and experimental stuff. I've been really dabbling into high BPM and incredibly energetic stuff, but I've been also listening to very feral and unstructured noise albums.
I'm also quite intrigued by Video Games as a form of art in and of itself, but I don't spend nearly as much time looking for video games to play as much as I like listening to new music (but I do game a lot, more then I'd like to actually).
As far as actually producing art, I haven't really found a niche that I can use as a creative outlet. I've been playing instruments since 7th grade, but I feel like I've never actually gotten good at an instrument, and I'm also much more interested in creating as opposed to playing. Truthfully, I've been dealing with quite a bit of existential fears relating to being creative, but hey, it happens.
Anyway, yeah. I really like music, so that makes two of us! high five"
457,isfp,"I guess music is a pretty popular one here. I'm also a musician, I'm the principal trumpet in my university. I play a couple other instruments pretty frequently, Guitar and Saxophone. I spend most of my time listening to music while I'm doing other things, like browsing reddit or playing video games. I've always been interested in art but I have difficulties with mental imagery so I can't translate what I'm thinking into a clear image/sculpture/whatever. "
458,isfp,"I work with food. Cooking, baking, charcuterie, and the like. While there is technically ""no wrong way"" to make art, I love that there's a very solid line between ""this came out awesome"" and ""shit, I fucked up""."
459,isfp,"film. I started a few years ago and I found it to be my perfect outlet. I never plan on showing many people, just my friends and what not, and they usually know how its gonna turn out cause they all helped me make them. But its great, telling a story from scratch with nothing but my camera. "
460,isfp,"It started with music, listening to it.  I invested in a nice sound system when i graduated high school and have been adding to it since.  In college, I started going to live music a TON, which introduced me to poi.  
So now, 4ish year later, I still spin Poi/firepoi a bunch and music is my motivation to do so.  Spinning without music is almost boring to me.  But being able to paint the air around me in fire is crazzzzy cool."
461,isfp,"I'm kinda picky with my fashion choices. I hate shopping at the mall, or any other overly cliche clothes store. Except H&M, they're okay I guess. I prefer Goodwill though. You can find some really weird/unique/decent stuff there. I always feel awkward wearing certain outfits on certain days though, like the clothes I'm wearing always have to reflect my mood. I felt pretty good when I woke up today, so I'm wearing my favorite shirt/jeans combo right now."
462,isfp,"Music here as well, I love listening to it and playing it, and when I am in the car, shower or home alone I love to sing it.  
I know how you feel about playing instruments, I played cello for 4 years(5th-8th grade) then started playing saxophone in 9th grade, and have been playing it ever since.  I am by no means ""good"" at the instrument but I still like to play it, and now that I am graduating college and cant play in  any of the bands I have been in I need to find a new way to play.
as for creating art, I have made a few things here an there, but I just dont feel like I have space (or time right now).  I would love to be able to have a crafts bench of sorts where I can start projects and just leave them there for months without much of an issue.  Oh well goals next apartment/house"
463,isfp,"Heeyyy alright! high five I forgot to mention that I play the piano. haha but some people never really find an instrument that they like so they end up never mastering one. I really like electronic music though, and there's so many sub-genres within electronic too. I'm interested in getting a synthesizer at some point, but I don't know if I'd have enough inspiration to make it worth my money. I go through different phases as well, one day I'll be listening to Nirvana or The Prodigy, and the next I'm into Futurecop! and Muse."
464,isfp,"That's one of the greatest things about making art, no one else has to know you messed up. Unless you REALLY fucked it up. But how do you like cooking and baking? I do a bit of that myself, and I was actually thinking about going to a Culinary Arts school after high school."
465,isfp,"It's a lot of fun and I highly recommend it, especially if you can take classes at a community college. I don't have Culinary Institute of America level knowledge, but I also don't have that level of debt. Definitely good to learn for cheap first in case it fits you better as a hobby/life skill than a career path."
466,isfp,"Any person who claims to be an ISFP but has an anime character for their profile pic or talks about being obsessed with anime, I automatically assume is an INFP. Am I wrong? Almost definitely. Am I able to stop this assumption? Not really. Do any of you have weird, inaccurate assumptions about other types??"
467,isfp,"I now assume every INTP is a jerk r/iamverysmart type that doesnt know shit about emotions and how to deal with them.
Hopefully there are INTPs that learned about these things and are mature enough, but I always assume this. "
468,isfp,"Everytime I see a person who is an xSTJ I automatically assume he/she has good work ethic. Could not be the case for everyone but lol
It doesn‚Äôt in any way affect how I deal with them, when it comes up in my head I try to acknowledge it as not necessarily true though"
469,isfp,"ENTJs are overly competitive in social situations 
and are insecure about their deeper emotions.
ENTPs habitually use people for gain.
Edit:i think i just missed the intention of this post. Sorry. "
470,isfp,"I fucking detest people who use an anime picture as their profile picture. I'm sorry dude. I know you feel like a ninja, but you don't even kind of resemble Naruto. Also only a casual watches that crap. Fight me."
471,isfp,Idk about you guys but every ISTJ/ISFJ i have met i have had an incredibly hard time trying to have fun with them because (in my experience) they‚Äôre only really comfortable doing things that they‚Äôre comfortable/familiar with and never want to do anything new so the assumption grew on me :/
472,isfp,"Lol every INTP I‚Äôve met has been kind of like that, but they‚Äôve also been so socially awkward that it kind of makes up for it?? Like, most INTPs I‚Äôve met seen kind of rude or self-centered at first, but once I get to know them, they turn out to be really sweet, and don‚Äôt realize that they come off super douchey. They DEFINITELY don‚Äôt know how to handle emotions though üòÇ."
473,isfp,"I feel like this is my biggest issue. For instance, every couple months I have this desire to start learning how to program and develop a career out of it but after a week or less I just feel jaded and don't care. Ever since I was a kid I wanted to have a career in Computer Science but I discouraged myself after seeing how much math was involved. Are there any other ISFPs that feel this way about any subject? I have a desire to be successful but not the motivation or discipline to follow through, it seems.  "
474,isfp,"i feel that. i've been wanting to start learning html or python for way too long :/
i usually go through waves/cycles of interest on things also. working on my motivation is something i'm aware of, but sadly can't motivate myself to motivate myself lol"
475,isfp,"Oh man, I feel that. It happens all the time, I find something I really want to learn how to do, whether it be 3D modeling, more in depth programming - like game design, or teaching myself basic mountain biking skills. I always end up loosing interest/putting it off.  I think its because of a mix of procrastination, loss of interest, and burning out.
I end up finding this cool new thing I want to learn and I tell myself I'll start on the weekend, but then the weekend comes around and I don't have time to do it because I only found out about this thing because I was procrastinating on the work I needed to do which is why I don't have time now. Then when I do finally have time I'm burnt out from doing all that work I should've done and I just want to chill and play video games. Having said that, I guess it does actually just stem from too much procrastination. 
In fact, I'm procrastinating right now (as I write this) while looking up new photoshop techniques. Damn it."
476,isfp,"I enjoy learning the basics of something, but then when I continue to practice I get fed with the fact that I'm still making mistakes.
Specifically with piano, I hate hearing myself play so I usually just get high when I practice to make rehearsing more enjoyable."
477,isfp,"It sucks, because I've taken some programming classes and even made a personal website for a class and I got a huge sense of accomplishment from that. At the end of the day, for some reason, that accomplishment still didn't motivate me to continue."
478,isfp,"Hello. I know this is not the most appropriate sub to post something like this but as a fellow isfp (or at least I believe I am) I have gotten tired of studying economics which I took just to take a career, I know, big mistake.
Now though, I've taken some time off from university to find out what do I truly want to do throughout my life and since I've played videogames, written and read stuff as early as I could remember I thought that the department mentioned in the title could just be the thing I've been looking for. Giving me a chance of storyboarding my long time inspired ideas by videogames, draw (which I'm not particularly good at at all but willing to get good at) and make games! Overall just express myself and make a job out of those ideas!
What has me worried about this though is programming. A friend of mine took his fair share of it and he didn't seem to enjoy it all that much.  He has taken some time to explain to me what's that All about and I can't help but be rather intimidated by it. Math and numbers overall have never been my strong suit and I'm genuinely worried that it might make me regret this choice.
Some suggest trying a career that has to do more with literature and while I'm not against it I would be lying if I didn't say that I find it a bit tedious at times.  
I do have a ""backup choice"" if anything and that would be learning a 3rd language (currently know 2) and give translation a shot, videogame translation if given the chance would be great. The languages I'm interested in are Japanese or Chinese maybe both if possible. While it isn't as much of an expressive profession as I would like I find it genuinely fun to learn a language since you are learning so much more than just the language. Culture, ideals and many other things fall there as well.
However in my current nearby area there are no bachelors provided by any university that involve any of the previously mentioned languages, the closest thing are electives so not much hope there...
What do you guys suggest/think about this situation?
Any sort of input helps and thanks in advance!"
479,isfp,"I have always loved programming, as it to me seems to be the perfects blend between logic and creativity. Within programming there are a lots of ways to solve the same problem, and it can require some really out of the box thinking to find the most efficient solution. I think learning a programming language in a lot of ways is the same as learning another language. Just like you create sentences according to grammatical rules in say Japanese, you create statements in programming according to rules of the programming language. Each line of code in programming basically says ""create textbox here"", ""add this number to that number 60 times"" etc.
Just check up a tutorial on C# (which I prefer) or Python (commonly learned to beginners) or something. It doesn't take long to learn the basics and get the feel for it."
480,isfp,"I'm an ISFP who works in games but in the art side of things.  I think if you're really worried if programming isn't your thing, you might as well see how far you can get into programming a small, small game.  If you get no joy from that then, yeah programming is probably not for you.  That said, you don't really need to do programming to get into the industry.  There's a lot of different kinds of fields involved.  Heck, I know someone who is an accountant for a game company haha.  Also don't go to school for game design, that's a crock of shit.
You could try to self study language if you're really passionate about it.  A degree would be nice but there are internationally recognized language tests you can take.  It's the JLPT for Japanese, not sure what the Chinese equivalent is."
481,isfp,"This is honestly a great question, since there's very little information out there on earning a spot in the video game industry. I'm studying to be a Graphic Designer, so maybe I can help you a tiny bit! :0
Video game designers and artists are, as the name obviously implies, artists in their own right. If you are physically/financially able, I would highly recommend moving to an area that would allow you to attend a university that gives you the sort of hands-on training and educational experience necessary from developers/designers who were successful in their fields. Because this field is fiercely competitive (and AWESOME!!), the educational facet of it is certainly helpful when trying to find a career in the video game industry.
However, what I have frequently heard from many people in the same shoes you're in is that the most important thing to have is a portfolio! :) Any person can call themselves a video game designer or artist and have the educational experience to boot, but on any resume, employers in the industry would actually prefer to see individuals who have forged their own success over having attended a school specifically for the trade. 
What this means is that employers would rather hire an individual who, for example, started their own independent project and was able to make it a success, rather than a person who just has nice-looking credentials/schooling but has only worked on many smaller projects from a variety of places without completing a project. Ask any professor/professional you become acquainted with during your time at school to help you build up a portfolio. You MUST, I repeat, MUST BUILD a portfolio. Get a group of friends together/find and network with people who enjoy the same field you do and make some projects--the more you make, the more astute you'll be when you're asked to demonstrate these sorts of skills later. Look at games that inspire you and artists/designers that worked on said games and read up on how they got their start in the industry. Practice drawing from life and sketching any ideas you may have in your head every chance you get. Find out what you're best at (level design, character design, game mechanics, etc.) and perfect your skills; it's good to be informed on a variety of things, too, but it's preferred that you demonstrate proficiency in one area of video game design and art. 
Take this part with a grain of salt, since I'm speaking from a graphic designing perspective and am not exactly sure if this applies to video game design as well: When you start putting work in your portfolio, do NOT make it so that only your oldest/worst work is first and your newest/best work is last. Leave that for a few specific pages in so that employers/internship supervisors can see your growth as an artist/designer over time, and a few pages dedicated to drawing studies/sketches/etc., but a majority of your portfolio should be a mix of your older and newer work to give it a sense of balance and create a greater aesthetic appeal.
On a side note, if you do end up taking a class that requires you to learn about programming, why not try 3D/character modeling/map building and the like instead? My university offers this sort of thing for students in the Science/Engineering building. Many community colleges offer foreign language courses that you can take if you do prefer becoming a translator. Perhaps try searching for one that offers Chinese or Japanese? Out of curiosity, what's the other language you currently speak? This can give you quite an edge when applying for jobs in the field in the future! Language is a powerful tool to have under your belt.
I wish you luck, fellow artist friend! c: Please do update us and let us know how your situation is in the future. Christ, I AM SO SORRY FOR THE NOVEL OF A COMMENT.
TL;DR: The school you attend isn't always important, what's important is your dedication to your passion! Go to a university specifically for these skills if you can, but if not, work on projects with your friends in the free time/try to make a name for yourself in the industry, practice, practice, practice, ask mentors for guidance and assistance, learn as much as you can about the field/industry, and most importantly, BUILD A PORTFOLIO, MAN! "
482,isfp,"The way I see it- if it's something you REALLY want to do, then go all out and do whatever you need to get the job. If you do end up failing after giving an honest try, you'll have at least, learned some good lessons about life through it and you'll be able to say you gave it your all. There are a lot of people in the world who never try and just accept an easier way, youll be of the few who tried to make the most out of your one life, "
483,isfp,I've read about It and I've been trying to self teach myself for some time and I can only go so far sadly :/ things get pretty complicated and I begin to need assistance but I'll see how I work that language thing out eventually. Getting into the gaming industry though art has been an option for me as well. Besides drawing I've thought if maybe Voice Overs and I've recently started fiddling with it. Hopefully something comes out of that! Thank you again for your suggestions. Definitely taking them into consideration. 
484,isfp,"Wow thanks! This was incredibly helpful! I'm definitely taking notes from your suggestions! As I said I am bilingual and I speak both Spanish and English. While my native language is Spanish I have adapted almost perfectly to the English language which is something I'm personally grateful for since I learned both naturally at a young age.
I suppose I should clarify at this point that I am from an island called Puerto Rico and the island is currently in a huge crisis that prohibits me from leaving in a sustainable way thus I'm stuck with the choices I have here. The public universities are a mess at the moment but I can't let that get in the way of my future career.
Regardless back to the matter at hand. There is one very promising private university called ""Atlantic University"" which is currently my top choice. They help you get started in just about everything as well as making your portfolio part of the curriculum itself which i found baffling. They also teach In a practical way not just theory, which I like a lot, and will definitely help me on my learning process. Curriculum include stuff like storyboarding, concept art drawing, a bit of math and programming. Basically the essentials of making videogames. That would mean I would have to let languages as a secondary thing for the far future since I can't wage both things at the same time due to cost effectiveness.
In terms of 3D character modeling and map building like you said to try and avoid programming as much as possible, the closest thing the university offers (i believe) is a digital animation bachelor which is not out of the realm of possibility either, I'd just have to get good at drawing lel.
Thanks again for dumping all that useful info. Your motivation is incredibly appreciated!
TL;DR thanks a bunch! I speak Spanish and English and my native language is Spanish. I also live in Puerto Rico, an island in great crisis handicapping my choices significantly. Atlantic is the best choice ATM and they even help out with portfolios! Japanese will have to take a side while I do this though. Digital animation could be another alternative to stray away from programming as much as possible."
485,isfp,"I know this was a week ago, but C# is probably very hard to pick up for a beginner. Its a great language to learn (or so I'm told) because it gives you a really good understanding of the magic that happens under the hood, but you aren't going to be making games with it any time soon unlike with java or python that are much easier to pick up.
Also math is not needed. At least, not really. You need to be able to employ simple math in very clever ways sometimes (at least, to make a program good/efficient). But you won't be doing matrices or finding the derivative of y with respect to x."
486,isfp,"I know that programming might be a little scary at first, but i guarantee you it's not that hard and you might end up liking it. I also think C# would be a bit hard for you to start, maybe even Java and Python might give you a pretty slow start.
Since you have zero experience, i recommend starting with an easy to use engine, like Godot, GameMaker Studio or Construct. They require little to no programming and they also have pretty active communities on Reddit and other forums."
487,isfp,"If you're worried about not being great at drawing, I wouldn't stress to much about it.  Drawing is a great skill to have but a lot of game art is technical to some degree.  It's all about building your eye for these things and knowing why a piece of artwork doesn't look right/how to fix it."
488,isfp,"so...what subs do u guys subscribe to? i was subbed to a lot of the ones you get when u sign up for reddit but im new so i dont know the good ones. i found ifyoulikeblank which is cool, and listentothis. music seems to b infected with snobs so i stay away frm that one. same w movies. any others i shud check out? rn im only subbed to gifs, iama, writingprompts, listentothis, n ifyoulikeblank.
this is my 1st post in here btw. nice to meet everyone."
489,isfp,"You could search for your interests using Google or something. If you have a hobby, there's probably a subreddit for it, if not more. 
I also use multireddits to separate the things I like to follow. I have an Android multireddit for following news and developments related to Android and Google. I have another multi for chill music, I think I found that one through listentothis. Another one for design, and yet another for fitness. Another one I call 'resources' for things like /r/personalfinance and /r/malefashionadvice , /r/frugalmalefashion and /r/travel. 
I have a bunch more as well, so as you can see Reddit can be a bit of a time sink. You've been warned haha"
490,isfp,"I currently find myself in this loop as well. 
How do you describe the fi-ni loop? 
Usually fi-ni loop in isfps is defined as paranoia particularly social paranoia, people are talking behind you're back about you or someone is out to get you. 
But I'm still interested to here what particularly iris that makes you think you are in the loop, maybe I can give more advice"
491,isfp,"Just to expand on that, it doesn't necessarily mean just go for lots of runs or work out, though those things can be very helpful. I've recently found that if I wear clothes that are comfortable, feel very tangible (I don't wear super thin t-shirts anymore, unless I wear something on top of it as well), and that I like the way I look in, I get much less anxious around people, which I consider to be the manifestation of the Fi-Ni loop in me. "
492,isfp,"(Subs like /r/wholesomememes)
In a way, I like what they stand for, but overall they seem.. rather artificial? I mean, the pictures are nice, but at the same time it kinda seems like they're generated and posted by bots or something, a bit too excessively trying to be nice and pleasant. And I don't think a happy meme is going to cheer me up much if I'm having a bad day."
493,isfp,"what you wrote is spot on, they're incredibly artificial and not helpful for me. I like positivity though and try to not be so negative, because it definitely makes things worse in my opinion. one of my favorite things to do when I'm feeling down is to try to just ignore stuff and pretend everything is fine"
494,isfp,"I like some of them, but more for the actual things people post. The comments and titles definitely seem very contrived to me. If I read too much of the stuff people say there I start to feel like it‚Äôs not acceptable to be sad, which isn‚Äôt exactly all that helpful to think when I am sad. I like the idea of positivity but you can definitely have too much of a good thing."
495,isfp,"I'm an INFJ and I have a good friend who I'm pretty sure is an ISFP. After reading more on you guys I just wanted to say you're awesome :). If you don't want to read a whole lot then ignore the wall of text below because here are my thoughts:
The good parts first. My friend is just... refreshing. It's like a breath of fresh air. When we talk there's no hidden messages behind anything, no drama, no nothing. It's down to earth. Easy. Seeing the world through her eyes is like stopping for just one second of my life and appreciating things. It's genuine, there's no trick to it. It restores my faith in humanity. 
Then the bad. Oh my lord respond to my texts PLEASE. I have my own La La land so I understand you're in one yourself but you gotta come down sometime. I know you don't mean to offend me when you forget plans or something but I place a lot of value in those things so I think I did something wrong when it happens.
So yeah. That's that. I appreciate you guys. Keep on keeping on :)."
496,isfp,"ISFP here! BS is anathema to me, I'm glad that others enjoy that honesty. 
As for the texts, your friend isn't the only one; I'll often see friends' messages and end up not replying immediately because either 1) I'm taking my time crafting my reply or 2) I get caught up doing something else. Not that I ignore my friends, it's just that I don't see the texts as urgent and then I get caught up in doing something I'm really interested... and time passes. Keeping plans and respecting my friends' time is very important to me, but it is something I have to actively keep in mind. It just takes some effort!"
497,isfp,"Haha such colorful language :).
Yeah, that's exactly what my friend says too. It was confusing to me at first because with most people, things like that would be a sign she doesn't want to see me. But it's just not like that. I'll try to keep in mind that it's effort for her :)."
498,isfp,"Hello to you, too, haha! Thank you, you must have looked for a very long time to find all those INFJs. I don't know many INFPs but I like them. I'm pretty sure our types aren't supposed to mesh either, but typing only goes so far.
That's exactly how I feel about my friend, too. It's annoying, but everyone has annoying bits and just the pure sincerity (you said earnestness, I like that, too) about her makes it worth it. She balances out my idealism by being grounded, and then she's so artistic and that just makes me happy. The best part is that she's not cynical. If you can tell I might like her a bit too much. "
499,isfp,"I didn't realize? so it's a challenge now, i will hunt some INFJ!
it's on.
Jokes aside, i learn to distinguish MBTI types when i get to know someone of that type, so by not having any INFJ friend plus the ""matching personality"" i just can't discern them"
500,isfp,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. The best advice I can give you if you want to meet one would be from my personal experience as well haha. I'll try not to sound conceited:
They're typically very talented at something creatively (can be art or something else, I'm good at coding) and overly kind. I mean kind to the point that it's not helpful anymore. We can have a glossy eyed look because we're thinking too much. 
The most identifiable thing I'd say is that we're typically quiet in a group setting but not afraid to stand up for almost anyone or anything if they deserve it (in our eyes). "
501,isfp,"So philosophy is usually considered a very N type thing, but I know I love a lot of philosophy. However, personally I‚Äôm only really interested in philosophy as much as it‚Äôs useful or relevant. I don‚Äôt really care much about things like the Ship of Theseus, even as it relates to identity, because regardless of when it stops being the ship I‚Äôm still going to live my life the same way. But things like ethics, existentialism, and absurdism I find very fascinating because they can provide a lot of insight into how I think I should live my life."
502,isfp,"It can have kinda practical/relevant applications, though. For an example, bakeries that have had their same starter going for years, decades, to centuries since they opened. They'll advertise it as making the bread more profoundly historic, and it's certainly cool in that they've managed to keep it going for so long, but considering that the process of feeding and keeping a starter requires throwing most of it out to replace with fresh ingredients, and the bacteria cultures in it are constantly changing with the environment, so while you could maybe have something interesting and unique lingering in an old starter, it's much more likely that it's ultimately pretty hella similar a much younger one.
Or something like an ancient institution that's still operating, maybe even in the hands of the same family. It's certainly intellectually interesting if something lasts for so long, but it still eventually gets to the point that it's only the same in name. If another institution or owning family took its place, the only real difference would be the loss of bragging rights, but the age and continuity still pulls a bit of regard like it makes it somehow fundamentally different and that you're interacting with the very same thing that everyone so many years ago did. But, ultimately, is it really, and are you really, or is it just a notably neat novelty?
In terms of identity, the main practical application I can think of is using it to let yourself stop clinging to long- lasting negative habits/ attributes because they're integral to some rigid identity, because really after long enough, you won't have the same identity regardless. "
503,isfp,I despise philosophy on the level I‚Äôve been exposed to it. Never really got into it because just a mere dabble into a philosophical conversation hurts my brain. What kind of philosophy are you guys into?
504,isfp,"That‚Äôs the thing, I think that whether or not it can be considered the same institution, it‚Äôs just a novelty. It‚Äôs kind of fun to think ‚Äúhuh, this institution has been running since the middle ages‚Äù or whenever it was. I just don‚Äôt find that worthwhile to think about as in that case it kind of ruins the fun for me. c:
Though now that you put it that way I think the ship of theseus may have seriously impacted the way I think about identity. So maybe it‚Äôs not all that useless. I certainly found it to be redundant at the time in my philosophy class though, lol."
505,isfp,"Super late response bc I kinda forgot oof. But yeah the first bit usually isn't an everyday thing and not quite so immediately important to life. I do see it in advertising a lot, though, especially since I'm currently working for one of said generational family-owned businesses, and the implication is always that being the same for so long must mean it's better, which definitely does influence people. And it just occasionally irks me a bit since I deal with it every day, and like yeah it's a neat novelty, but ultimately it's not like you're actually getting the same service from those actual founders even if they are descendants. And ultimately isn't it basically just glorified nepotism?
But actual reason for responding though was remembering the one other major application of something like the ship of theseus I've come across. Awhile back I was reading someone talking about their recovery from rape and how they felt fundamentally violated by it for years, and what finally offered relief was realizing that after a certain point, cell death and replacement made it so that even if their body had been physically violated, it had been changed to a point of no longer even being that body, no longer having physically been touched by a rapist. Maybe not a universally applicable use of the idea, but definitely a very valuable one. "
506,isfp,"i used to enjoy reading when i was younger but now i don't use my pastimes for reading at all.. i only read if i am literally bored out of my mind - and at that point i do enjoy a book! and when others are talking about book storylines and all that, i do think it might be fun to read i just never get around to doing it myself lol"
507,isfp,"If they're interesting enough, then yes. Fahrenheit 451 was one of my favorites. I do read comics sometimes too. Although reading isn't really my strong suit, I tend to space out too much when reading something."
508,isfp,"Yup, novels, plays and audiobooks (librivox is a good audio source for public domain books)
The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa is the best feel good novel I've read so far (in my biased opinion, I think its very ""ISFP"" fiction)."
509,isfp,"I do, though I'm not a great reader. I'm always convinced I can become a better reader by doing it more, but my mind still wanders a lot when I read. I always find it hard to focus entirely on what I'm reading and end up missing things."
510,isfp,"I don't read novels or books, but I don't hate it, either. I think I've never read a book or novel from cover to cover in all my years of living so far. This might be going off topic, but: I'd rather be doing something realistic/concrete, visual/musical or something nonfictional, cos I find real life more interesting than fiction?"
511,isfp,"I just started as an animal caretaker at a pet shop and after a few years of working food service and retail this job is a breath of fresh air.
The first thing i noticed was the difference in the vibe of my co workers. Everyones more introverted and calm, no gregarious high energy people that i have to feel pressured to make conversation with. The whole day was mostly quiet except for fish tanks bubbling and birds singing.
Its also a very low stress job. You have to be timely of course but you dont have to feel rushed and stressed out with multitasking. As long as you get everything done before its time to leave youre good. 
The best part is its in the back away from the customers so you never have to put on a customer service persona.
If you dont mind doing a lot of cleaning this job is the most fitting job ive found and its also really rewarding to know youre directly improving the lives of small creatures. If youre having trouble as an isfp finding a minimum wage job you like i recommend this one."
512,isfp,"Great! It's a good feeling to find your place in the world. I'm trying to find mine, so I envy you.
I hope this comfy place you found can help you become grounded and ready for more adventures to come!"
513,isfp,"Very cool, the part about not having to put a customer service persona sounds very appealing... bonus points if it's a low stress job. I'll definitely be considering it in the future. Thanks for the recommendation!"
514,isfp,"I listen to most chill electronic music, chill trap future bass. Pretty much anything melodic and slow. 
On the other hand I love dubstep which I can get pretty heavy and crazy. I don‚Äôt listen to ‚Äúregular‚Äù music for lack of better term "
515,isfp,"I love pop music... like, the lighter and happier, the better. I also love rap and R&B.
I used to listen to a LOT of progressive metal and post-grunge, and I still do once in a while, but I don‚Äôt fw it like I used to. I like music that makes me feel energized."
516,isfp,"Stereotypes affect us all to a greater or lesser extent, and we tend to embody them. This makes us get away from who we are, instead of making us who we are.
‚Äã
Reading and thinking about MBTI gives me the feeling that I'm consuming my time. Constantly analyzing myself and thinking about my personality and that of others.
‚Äã
I always had a problem trying to find out what's my type. Lately, I wrote some articles about cognitive functions, and I had to read many articles to be able to explain the functions with my own words, but almost none of the descriptions that I read said something specific and conclusive of cognitives functions.
‚Äã
For that same reason, the descriptions of the 16 types become kinda futile. I still don't know for sure what my type is. INFP, ISFP, could even be ISFJ. Enneagram 461, 641, or some other.
‚Äã
I didn't like my article, nor anyone else's. I realized that none leaves you with something in your hands. There is nothing you can grab. There are many people in this community who can't find their type either. This is only possible with a bad system. There are people who profit from this, but even among professionals there are disagreements.
‚Äã
This theory is a time drainer. Be honest and think if you have ever grown up with this theory. Since I will not be here anymore, I wanted to tell you these words, because maybe they will help you as I was helped by this post. If you are looking for inspiration for leaving this theory, here is:
‚Äã
https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNonsenseMBTI/comments/b6idds/why_mbti_is_not_for_me_and_possibly_not_for_you/"
517,isfp,"Yeah, trying to use the theory to figure out your life you‚Äôll end up hurting yourself because it‚Äôs impossible to boil people down to such a simple thing while retaining enough information to be valuable. I like it, but more as a kind of improved horoscope that has enough truth in it for me to find entertaining.
Edit: Read a bit of your other post and it seems to be weird that you‚Äôre phrasing it as demonic and such religious things. That doesn‚Äôt really make sense. I agree getting too into MBTI can be a bit harmful but thinking that for religious reasons is pretty ridiculous."
518,isfp,"I respect your choice. I think we can all understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I mean, 16 types define 8 billion people? Yeh, alright. We all know mbti can be/is flawed.
However, the majority of us use it for either entertainment or self help purposes. I don‚Äôt see why it fails in either of those categories. 
In all honesty? I‚Äôm very happy I found mbti. Beforehand, I distinctively remember being very stuck. I didn‚Äôt know myself. I saw myself as this plain, boring person with no positives. However I discovered my type, read about our ‚Äúskills‚Äù and was like hm, I‚Äôve never been creative. Perhaps I‚Äôll try drawing. And guess what? I‚Äôve loved it. I‚Äôve been able to really play to my strengths, and recognise my weaknesses. 
To say that I fit into my type perfectly would be absurd. ISFP isn‚Äôt my identity. My identity is me. And me is an ISFP. 
Maybe how you feel about mbti is dependant on how you go about your life. I think a lot of us are constantly searching to understand ourselves. Many people would even say that the aim of humanity is to learn and understand. Mbti is like a simple, accessible key to that. A key which opens many doors. 
One more thing is that we all love to relate to things. We love feeling understood. And when you read about your type and you‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh my.. that‚Äôs literally me? everything makes sense!‚Äù It‚Äôs a very unique feeling. 
Eh, I rambled on about nonsense a bit. I‚Äôm not trying to call your view wrong. I wish you the best of luck in future, and I hope all happiness comes your way. Perhaps if you benefit from leaving you could come explain why it helped? Who knows. Best wishes though!"
519,isfp,"Hey, I feel you. I've been way too sucked into it before too. i kinda realized with arguing about what types people are there's no way to prove anything it's always just your own speculations against other people's speculations. No way to know anything for certain. I still come around here tho for fun I guess. Plus I do think it has at least more merit than astrology going off of anectdotal evidence. And in the way and that people who relate to my type I actually did relate with.
Anyway, bye kind internet stranger!
I definitely don't see it as demonic or evil haha that's a bit of a stretch."
520,isfp,"I‚Äôm reminded of the song Box of Rain by The Grateful Dead.  
Believe it if you need it
If you don't just pass it on  
Reading about personality types helped me make sense of my loneliness and validated my differentness. I‚Äôm grateful to be able to connect with similar personalities going through similar struggles. It‚Äôs also true that any form of separation, or any intentional divisiveness, is unhealthy, causing us to get stuck in rigid thought patterns. MBTI isn‚Äôt an inherently evil system - at its core, it seeks understanding. As with any system, if we depend on it to frame our understanding, we will become trapped in it until we can let it go, taking what we learned with us."
521,isfp,"I don't consider myself jealous, unless there's reasonable suspicions. In that case I'd inquire and demand honesty. I trust the person I'm with and if they abuse it and cheat, then they're just not the person I want to be with anyway. I give people frew will to make their choices, but to own and be responsible for them. I want the person I'm with to be themselves, to have hobbies, friends, an unstressful life, to be happy. 
I've been on the other side and I know just how much it weighs when the person you're with irrationally wonders and doubts about every move or decision you make. I myself want to feel free to meet my friends, my colleagues, family, without having to be anxious, without worrying that my S.O will get mad at me. They have to make me feel safe, not caged.
My partner is my safe haven. He has my back. He understands me and nurtures my growth and happiness. A relationship is made of trust and respect and I expect it as much as I give it."
522,isfp,"Dear fellow ISFPs.
What are your favourite books, music and movies? Doesn‚Äôt have to be MBTI related. Just your personal favourites. Don‚Äôt feel like you have limit yourself to a couple. Write a whole list if you must. Thanks. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
523,isfp,"Just being real- I don‚Äôt really like reading, I get bored lol. I did love To Kill a Mockingbird, and I loved the Hunger Games series when I was younger.

529,isfp,"Hey guys, so I work at a cafe close to my college and theres a girl who also goes to my college and works with me at the same cafe too. We met at college and she got a job here with me as well later down the track.
So this girl, who is an ISFP, doesn't talk to anyone at work and only talks to me even when other guys are there. We hit it off and go real deep in conversations every single time. She opens up to me about secrets going on in her family and I open up about mine to hers. However, I did notice her mood does change when ever she brings up her real thoughts and feelings and she doesn't like talking about them.
However, all of this is in person. She never texts me after work, unless its about a shift or if its me texting her, then she'll take a while to reply. And when she does reply its never to carry on the conversation, but rather only answers the question.
I am so confused now, at work we talk all day, talk about real deep shit like our feelings and what troubles us, but once work is over she goes home and its all forgotten.  
So is she into me? I'm worred about asking her out because I'm afraid the feelings aren't mutual. I do like her, but I am so confused. I am an ENFP male."
530,isfp,"I don't know if this is true for all isfps, but personally I don't love text conversations. If she's anything like me, it's not necessarily a sign of disinterest if she's not texting you first/much. I couldn't say if she's romantically interested or not, but meeting in person, outside of work, is probably going to give you a better idea. "
531,isfp,"She absolutely sounds interested. As someone else said, we don‚Äôt like text really. I know that I will go hours on end every day not replying, even to people I like. It just doesn‚Äôt quite capture our interest. 
Perhaps try calling her? If I‚Äôm close enough with someone, that is a big preference for me. Ask her out or something. Idk man, your call haha. But chances are good she‚Äôs interested in you in at least some way. Good luck!"
532,isfp,"Yes.
If she‚Äôs talking to you to any extent, especially when she ignores others, she probably likes you. We don‚Äôt talk just for the sake of it and most ISFPs have zero problem coming off as ‚Äúaloof‚Äù.
Texting is impersonal and I hate it and also am waaay too proud to seem like I‚Äôm pursuing someone. 
 I also hate phone calls. I can only really connect with someone in person.
Also, you‚Äôre ENFP? She‚Äôs probably smitten fr. "
533,isfp,"It sounds to me like she likes you and finds you to be a nice, genuine person to be with. Your personality must have attracted her and made her feel comfortable to come to if you're the only one she prefers to talk to than the other guys around. Maybe you both also share some common interests with each other?
I'm not sure what she feels about you love relationship wise though. She may or may not be interested. Maybe she only sees you as a coworker she gets along with or maybe not. I don't know her personally or what her preferences are. Is she single or dating with another currently? Or is she interested in someone else, but it hasn't happened yet? Maybe you should ask what her views are about relationships first before you ask her out if you haven't already? Just to make it more clear because you sound very unsure. But I'm sure she wouldn't mind sharing her opinions of that with you and would not think too much into it.
I know I prefer in person then say phone calls, text or other devices. But I understand that it's needed especially when you can't constantly be together all the time. It's not that she doesn't like you, I'm sure she doesn't mean to come off the way you are saying she is. I'm positive she cares about you as an individual and about your shared bond with her.
If you are interested in her, just remember to be patient and openly understanding of her side too. =)
‚Äã"
534,isfp,"Thanks for your replies everyone. It seems texting might just not be her thing. We do spend some time after talking even more to each other after work on our way to the bus stop/car. Sometimes we talk for 30 minutes before we actually go home. And no, she doesn't have a boyfriend. What do you guys think? Romantic interest or friendzoned?"
535,isfp,"I actually forgot to mention this. When we finish work, we wait for each other and walk together, she walks to her bus stop and I walk to my car, but we stop in between and talk sometimes for 30 minutes or sometimes 10 minutes. I guess that might give it away..."
536,isfp,"Well we don't like to be controlled so just give her space and take it easy... the less pressure you put on her and the more comfortable you make her, the more she'll like you and wanna be around you. "
537,isfp,"who knows. I agree to take it easy though. have fun and flirt a little bit but don't take it too far(I'm sure you have already flirted a bit though)
dating in the workplace isn't recommended by most people, but in my opinion if both people like each other then it's fine. I have only had good chemistry with a handful of people so far(though I'm also only 24 and don't actively date much). seems like a waste of an opportunity to me if you don't go for it"
538,isfp,"You think? I definitely get your point; however if im really into them and comfortable, I absolutely want to video call them. Though emphasis on the ‚Äúvideo‚Äù part. By the sounds of how comfortable they are in person, I cant imagine they‚Äôd be massively opposed to calling if they‚Äôre interested. I think it‚Äôs worth a try at least."
539,isfp,"other than giving me a write up of words to help people understand how I view the world around me, it hasn't impacted anything about me. It sort of just confirmed what I already knew and couldn't say. "
540,isfp,"I'm an isfp and I used to do accounting.   I really felt like it changed me and it was difficult to be the ""mellow,  unassuming, sweet"" person that I was.  In the end I quit and I was so happy after I did, even if it did mean unemployment and having to find a new career path. "
541,isfp,"Thanks for sharing this link - what a great video. I think many ISFP talents are hidden, some of us (like this girl in the beginning) are too afraid to share them with the world..or not even that, like we're afraid of ourselves. It wasn't nervousness from the crowd she was feeling, it was pressure she had on herself. Some of us need to wing it in order to perform (notice how her dancing was her just feeling it, nothing pre-planned). This is hard to express in a dominant Te world in which society pushes us to be more Te."
542,isfp,"Im an estp male dating an isfp female  for the past two years and I love her a lot and I think isfps are the only type that make me feel something close to even feeling or feeling loved but I seem to have been feeling boxed overall in life and think im getting more restricted in my expansive ways of living .
Isfps are my supervisor and the dynamics from what I've read seem to be too bad  for the estp.
Can you guys help me to overcome this idealization I have for her ?  "
543,isfp,"My best friend is an ESTP. He has a lot of new crazy ideas all the time and I'm the one who keeps him grounded. Sometimes if we stay in that dynamic too long it just turns out to be me shooting his ideas down left and right. Not sure if it's similar to your situation.
A reminder that it's okay to venture out and try new things even if they might not work out ideally is useful. Fuck the comfort zone and all that.
Above all, let your partner know exactly what is giving you these feelings so you can work it out."
544,isfp,"I think you‚Äôre idealizing her bc she‚Äôs well versed in Fi. I idealize the isfp supervisor, enfp, bc they are well versed in Ne‚Äî good at seeing patterns and predicting what will happen, meaning that they are comfortable with change and can see multiple options and consequences. As isfp my biggest fear is chaos, so that‚Äôs admirable to me. For your relationship, estps have weak Fi so they struggle with more internal conflicts relating to expressing themselves outwardly. You may feel that whenever you have troubling feelings or thoughts you may not know how to express them. Basically your biggest fear is her biggest strength. Realize that you can strengthen your weakness. 
Honestly though, your isfp likely admires you too. I remember an estp I was attracted to but thought I wasn‚Äôt compatible with. I was scared of all the things he was good at‚Äî being charming and good at dancing, taking care of his physical health and appearance, being fearless. You should talk with her about your concerns‚Äîdon‚Äôt start by saying what‚Äôs bothering you (bc maybe it‚Äôs not your forte to talk about negative stuff), but start by being charming and playful and suggestive and open her up for convo. Or, if she‚Äôs good with criticism, just tell her how you feel. We like honesty and sincerity :)"
545,isfp,Lol she made me use my Fi bro. I went into depression by even trying to figure out what it was since she was incapable of being as flexible and open as me and when I finally tried developing Fi I wasted one year not doing anything and got caught there. Now I have a decent level of Fi. 
546,isfp,"Oh‚Äî well shit.. I was saying that because I had a specific estp in mind.  I hope I did not offend you‚Äî the esfp I knew was afraid of telling me his more negative stuff. Then I think that‚Äôs because Fi is very restrictive naturally. Fi makes sure things are restricted‚Äî especially moral-wise (in socionics anyway). Fi thinks this is having personal/high standards.Unhealthy isfps  are REALLY restrictive, because unhealthy isfps depend on their dom way too much and ignore their aux,Se, which is more exploratory. I think she needs to learn how to compromise with you in this case."
547,isfp,"Make everything black, replace the candle with incense and the rosewater with a couple fingers of bourbon, neat, take the ears off the headphones, get rid of those little ball thingies and those characters on either side of the screen, change the screensaver to early Black Sabbath, add a stack of cds and pen and paper for writing down random epiphanies/other notes, and I'm here for it üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚úåÔ∏è"
548,isfp,"the ironic part is i never actually played most of the games on here lmao. now i have maplestory 2, stardew valley, skyrim, and probably some others but i just keep most of my games in my steam library"
549,isfp,"I'm in fear of this:
- Sits on chair
- Put hands on keyboard
- Turn neck right for about 15 to 30 degrees
- Starts gaming
- Hours goes by
- Misterious neck pain appears
- Days go by 
- Routine repeats
- Neck does gets cramped up
- Goes to the doctor
- Doctor says ""You should quit videogames for a while""
- Quits videogames
- Cycle starts over
- I cry."
550,isfp,"I‚Äôm not very openly affectionate. I‚Äôve learned as I‚Äôve gotten older to make myself say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù occasionally and give compliments to my friends often so they know I don‚Äôt hate them. But I‚Äôve noticed that, in general, I tend to make fun of the people I truly care about. Not ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ugly‚Äù kind of making fun, but more like copying someone‚Äôs voice if they say something weird or teasing them about something.
Anyways, I‚Äôve always kind of pushed people away a lot, and it JUST occurred to me that when I‚Äôm ‚Äúteasing‚Äù my friends, they might not be interpreting it the way I intend. I usually bond with others over humor, and NEVER being up things I know people are insecure about or make fun of impressions or accents or whatever. But I‚Äôm worried others might think I‚Äôm picking at them just to pick at them (and not because I love them lol) and get irritated with me. 
I‚Äôm just curious, is there anything strange you guys do to show that you care about the people in your life, or are you pretty straightforward with your affection?"
551,isfp,"Im the same as you. I think teasing is just an easier way to talk to people when we are not too close with a certain person, but care about them. Its like a way to mask my own insecurity of getting rejected I think.  Usually, once the other person shows the same signs of caring or wanting to know each other better, then I'll reciprocate by being more serious. "
552,isfp,"This is heaps relatable to me -- I'm also very teasing with people I love, as long as I can tell they'll know that I'm just teasing. With my friends, it's pretty much just that on top of doing stuff for them that shows I care about them, like giving them rides when they need it or helping them clean their kitchen or something. "
553,isfp,If I am close to someone I show it through availability and reliability more than anything else. If you're looking for company I am only a phone call away. I'll be there to save the day. Superman has got nothing on me.
554,isfp,"If I'm really close (like basically just my little family, 2 kids and husband), then it's easy for me.  I'm always showing love, affection and praise.    It's harder with other friends and family that are outside of my protected little family bubble.  I guess I just feel the safest here at home, it's hard to be vulnerable with other people. "
555,isfp,"We roast each other in my family to show love. My best friend is very affection and gives lots of praise and love, this was hard for me to adapt to and I am uncomfortable a lot of the times giving or receiving affection from her. We‚Äôve been friends for 3+ years and she‚Äôs hugged me like 3? Times? I‚Äôm not here for it. But she‚Äôs super picky and I used to roast/tease her for it all the time until she told me it really hurt her feelings. Love languages are hard. "
556,isfp,"To be honest, I‚Äôm still really young (I‚Äôll be 18 in two months), but I‚Äôve always wanted to eventually get married and have kids, however, one of my biggest fears is that I might not be openly affectionate enough with them. I‚Äôm definitely happy that it works out well for you, at least in your ‚Äòlittle family bubble‚Äô:)."
557,isfp,"I produce music and want to share it with the world and get hyper vigilant every time I share it with others to see if they like it hehehe. I also clam up every time I hear shitty, cliche, simple minded, myopic radio music, only to remind myself how subjective music is :D

558,isfp,"I mean like, leaving one job after being in it for some years then switching to a totally different one, even better if in a different industry, then rinse and repeat. What was that like? How did it go for you?
I figured it might be good to ask fellow ISFPs because we're the personality who values freedom to explore life, skills and talents the most. I'm scared to ask a very broad thread as they might not understand and be quick to judge.
Also, a bit of background why I'm asking: I've been thinking about this for many nights now. I'm 26, and I feel like I might go down this route. There are oh so many things I want to try and do that I feel like I won't be able to devote my life to a single career. I wanna try being a voice actor, theater or TV actor, or a TV host; I also want to try life behind the camera, like be a scriptwriter or even whatever assistant; then I also want be in the helping profession, teach kids with or without special needs, etc etc! But as you know, everyone says that you have to be a ""master of one"" if you want to be successful in life...
‚Äã
EDIT: Thanks everyone for sharing your experiences! It's comforting to know I'm not weird for having this mindset. I'm so amazed by how all of you have already done so much. I don't make a lot of jumps because I get too affected by other people's opinions sometimes. Add to that, I'm co-breadwinner of the family so I have to sustain my income. I do feel left out sometimes because some friends are now up the corporate ladder even though I know in my heart, I don't want that for myself (I left my first job just as when I was in line for a promotion because that will keep me in my cubicle longer). Anyway, we make our own happiness and successes, right? Thanks again guys!!"

560,isfp,"I've worked in the outdoor industry, coffee industry, pastoral position, a writer, and even worked in Alaska for a Barge and Tug company. I've done woodworking, metalworking, worked in a forge, taught people to make knives, throw knives, and shoot guns. 
I was a substitute teacher for 6 months in classrooms from preschool to 6th grade.
I've even worked for the forest service. 
I'm 25. "
561,isfp,"i'm a little late to the game here... but yeah i think there's nothing wrong with spreading your interests out! go where your interests take you!
i'm questioning my path in university right now, and have been on and off there for a while. i too am juggling the ""master of one"" vs ""jack of all trades"" mental battle! that said i'm getting more interested in taking small certification programs for becoming a travel agent, a floral designer, and/or working in the legal cannabis industry here in canada. 
i have worked only a few jobs. i have been a fruit picker, clerk at a swimming pool, housekeeper at a hostel, and deli clerk. i have sold some things i've created/found over etsy, and i worked as an extra in a hallmark movie once, lol!
i think variety is the spice of life. we're only here for a bit - it is in our best interest to make it work for us and explore what we feel drawn to! i hope my career path can reflect that once my time on earth is up. i also think that there's so many ways to approach work, you can be doing 9-5, or doing your own thing, or having a couple things going all at once. lifestyle is a great consideration of mine and i hope i can learn to create the lifestyle that works for me!
good luck out there!"
562,isfp,"Welllll... Librarian, Soldier, Administrative Staff, Helicopter Maintenance Librarian, Care Provider for the Homeless, Line Cook, Insurance Agent, Financial Consultant, Child Protection Coordinator
I don‚Äôt feel as accomplished as my peers have been (many of whom have established decorated careers (I‚Äôm 28) and often have found their ‚Äúcalling in life‚Äù). I also don‚Äôt have as much income as they do (cause changing jobs drastically pushes ‚Äúreset‚Äù and you get paid from the bottom rung all over again).
But I don‚Äôt regret it as much as I thought I would (I do, sometimes, mostly to do with lack of sustainable income). I find that I can handle my own problems better, finances, organisation, cooking, taking care of children (none of my own, but if a future in-law ever asks, I can tell them I‚Äôm government approved good-with-kids heh). 
At the end of the day, I have a better understanding to do for myself what my peers pay others to do for them. (I wouldn‚Äôt say for free though, the effort that goes into it surely wastes my time in ways that I could have paid someone else and saved time (think: cooking, finances), but at least this way there‚Äôs no real feeling of out of pocket pinch)"
563,isfp,"I love this! Thanks for sharing your story and all the best to you as well. At some point in my life, I also wanted to be a fruit picker!! I'm very happy to know there are people like you guys. Where I'm from, only vertical growth is considered success. People around me frown upon those who choose to satisfy their curiosities and it's really frustrating for me. I lighten up every time I read answers here."
564,isfp,"Hmm... I'm still in the same field (IT) but different role. Also, I'm currently much more devoted to my volunteer work which is in the helping profession. I haven't switched a lot yet as I'm still young, so I'm curious to hear from those who have done plenty. Do they regret not being ""the best"" at something? How has this affected their professional life?"
565,isfp,"So recently my ISFP friend broke up with his girlfriend. But apparently his gf wasn't contented and started to post false information about him all over social media and inventing stories about him cheating on her. She's a Fe dom, and can get manipulative at times, enough to convince anyone of her 'truth'.
My friend's a pretty touchy guy, and takes attacks personally, but so far he's said NOTHING about the matter, even to his closest friends. He hasn't done anything to defend himself against slander even though he's had abundant opportunities to do so.
I'm trying to defending him, but I also want to know about his feelings. How private are ISFPsÔºüIs it common for ISFPs to guard their feelings from outsidersÔºü If so, how can I help ease his distressÔºü
I know I sound annoying, so thanks for your patience if you made it to this last sentence."
566,isfp,"I, personally, have a very hard time sticking up for myself. I feel like everyone has an opinion and they have a right to that opinion. But it's easy to stick up for myselfwhen someone else starts it and I can build off their confidence. I am extremely guarded. But get me talking, I'll tell you anything. Ask the questions. "
567,isfp,"I think sticking to him shows, to those that may read those false comments, that maybe they're not true.
If one person (you) hangs out with him, maybe he's not such a bad person, right?
If I was him i'd use the ""occasion"" to take note on those that believe the false information without questioning them.
Fly low and observe other people's reasoning and behaviour.
If someone believes shitty and false stuff about me without doubts, then good to know, i'll avoid that person."
568,isfp,"She wants him to worry and defend himself 
If it's all false the silent treatment is a good option, not even engaging in the bs.
Realize you really cant prove anything in a private relationship, it is all he said she said. Ignoring it and moving on with life is a great option."
569,isfp,"I too would just ignore the comments, if I were him. (I am also ISFP) because it‚Äôs not my responsibility or care if people I don‚Äôt know believe me or not. If someone directly asked me then I would tell my side to them. I would also probably only talk about it with close family and my bestfriend."
570,isfp,"sounds about right 
don't engage the crazy don't fan the flames."
571,isfp,"It is difficult to stand up for myself when in the face of an authority figure but ISFPs have limits too. If I‚Äôve been crossed in person and I‚Äôve stewed in it a bit, I won‚Äôt hesitate to confront you. 
I would offer support for sure. "
572,isfp,"I use actions to make up for my inability to express myself verbally, esp when I'm nervous/ confused. 
I was really touched by something my mother did the other day and since I'm not one to say the 'L word' not even to family, I had to do something to tell her how much I appreciate her, so I did what I always do in such situations, I made a card and in place of love I put ""admiration for your kindness towards nature and humanity"" and gave it to her and fled the room. I don't think it aptly conveyed how I felt cause her reaction was a sweet thanks. Her INFP needs more verbal affirmation than I can give. 
This one surprised me, a dorm-mate of mine was terribly upset and watching her cry in the mess made me want to console her but I never know what to do, I'm really awkward with crying persons. Plus she had her friends around her so I didn't have to do it, instead when I went back to the room I pulled out a chocolate bar and a sticky note saying ""Hope this makes you feel better"" and left it on her desk. "
573,isfp,"It is most definitely accurate. I am terrible at verbalizing my thoughts. And it helps that my love language is acts of service. 
Last night my boss made me a delicious strawberry smoothie and I was so stoked that I washed the blender he used and the 2 cups and then proceeded to get almost half his work done for him along with my work to show my gratitude. Needless to say- food is the way to my heart haha. 
When I was really poor and my best friend would cover my expenses sometimes I would repay her cleaning her entire apartment when she wasn't home and surprising her. "
574,isfp,"I tried to do this, but my mum's a dum dum and didn't understand and I felt like what I did was useless. I still try, just in my nature, I guess, but there are times where I force myself to say it in words and then it comes ouy really awkward and then I cover it up with my shitty humor. Not like, ""lol, jk"", but more like I'm forcing the conversation to move on. Me speaking through actions doesn't get understood. (Does that sentence even make sense?)"
575,isfp,"I'm a people pleaser and suck at planning so I keep agreeing to do things I probably shouldn't at work and at home. I think things take less time then they do plus I don't plan my time well (and I'm slow as hell).
All this has ended in me barely keeping my head above water at work (and super stressed all the time) and breaking the trust of my husband by not following through on all my promises. 
I need help figuring out how to change this, since just desperately wanting to change hasn't worked for me in the past. I need to figure out how to manage my ISFP qualities to allow myself to manage my life such that when I say I'm going to do something, I actually can (and to turn down / delay requests when I can't).
Appreciate any feedback, sources, help you can give. Therapy? Courses? I'm desperate to change..."
576,isfp,"For your short-term problems, I think it might be time to ask for help. Just tell those at work and home something like, ""Look, I think I underestimated all of this. I'm struggling to do x, y, and z"" and then either ask for help and/or an extension. It happens so don't beat yourself up over it and it's not bad to ask for help. 
For your long-term biting-off-more-you-can-chew problem, maybe find a way to remind yourself not to promise anything when someone asks. When people ask, tell them you'll think about it and get back to them when you've done that. While you're thinking about it, this can be a time to practice planning it out thoroughly since planning is really something everyone should learn how to do anyway. If you find that it's too much for you to bear, tell them that you can't. If you think you can manage, tell them you'll try and say you won't make any promises, just in case to give you some leeway. At least, at this point, you will have some sort of plan to stick to and follow. 
At the surface, this sounds like a productivity issue, but I think you just need to learn more about your own limits and figure out a way to communicate that to other people. You're not letting anyone down by refusing to do something you can't do from the get-go. I always hide behind the vague, ""I'm really busy"" excuse when I'm unsure or know that I can't, but if I find the time, I will go out and surprise them by asking if they need help. "
577,isfp,"
Plays a ton of sports. He likes history, wants to do history. 

He's very impulsive, would skip classes to do random stuff. But he 'studies' for long periods of time. (Lots of zoning out though) Also gets quite mediocre grades. Words like fickle, restless and unfocused can all be used to describe him. 
From what I have gathered, he falls for girls easily. And gets over them in a very short time. He said he's submissive in nature, but he likes... being the more dominant one in relationships, that's why he likes shy females?
I'm ENTP, and I'm not sure if he feels the same way, but our conversations feel insubstantial. At least the online ones. It's easier to talk to him face-to-face. He's very open to my weirdness and he gets my dark humour. But still insubstantial. We used to text everyday, but it felt very exhausting on my end because we are very different people and I felt like I constantly had to act bubbly and nice when we text. Otherwise he would feel uncomfortable.
He's also very averse to conflict and drama. If he senses conflict he would try his best to not get involved.
He's also a very nice person. He can't stand the idea of someone disliking him, so he tries his best to be nice to everyone. I don't think he engages in any form of art-making, song-writing, or poetry-composing. But he has this hidden depth. When prodded, he can and will discuss functioning parallels between his friends, motives of his counterparts etc. etc. He uses big words too. 
He has a TON of friends. But he has no qualms about being seen alone? He eats alone quite often. But he's a chill person. He makes friends easily, bonds with them over sports. "
578,isfp,"Calling all ISFPs from their hiding holes and asking out of curiosity! I just want to know if the way other ISFPs react in emotionally-charged situations like having a crush/being in a relationship are similar to the way I currently feel. I also really enjoy hearing about others' experiences in general!
I've noticed that each time I begin to develop feelings for someone, I'll at first talk to them openly and comfortably, but the more my feelings for the person intensify, the more I avoid them/ghost them and try to pretend they don't exist, or that they never heard I liked them in the first place. My biggest fears, although somewhat typical, have always been that the person would consider me odd, leave me because of issues with my family (as I've had very terrifying childhood experiences), or think I wasn't good enough for them.
What sorts of experiences do you all have to share? How do you initially speak in front of those you like? (Quickly, calmly, etc.) "
579,isfp,"I might act chill with them if my feelings are subconscious, but once I start to fully realize I like them I act disinterested for some reason. I'm working on being more assertive since I had skinny love with this one guy. He got bored with me and eventually started flirting with one of my friends :( "
580,isfp,"I'm a pretty mellow person on the regs. So as long as you vibe with me, or intrigue me long enough I'll be interested. When I realize I like a person, I tend to want to know more. I'd slide in the DMs and whatnot.
When I draw something for them? Thats when it's donezo, I really like you."
581,isfp,"When I have a crush on someone, when I admire them or think they are very beautiful, I also tend to get away from them, even physically, because people might notice it and I'll be vulnerable, and they might like me back and then I'll be vulnerable again, and will probably get hurt.
I have the tendency to take care of everyone around me and put myself in a lower priority, so I need to be careful with that. I've dated a guy for 5 years (I'm a girl) and it ended terribly, he cheated on me and I still felt like I loved him. So I definitely don't want to go back to feeling dependent on someone else. I've been single for 3 years and am enjoying it, I still have meaningful relationships but haven't ""found"" someone I'd want to spend my life and effort around that one person"
582,isfp,"When I have a crush I keep it to myself, be myself by wanting to just absorb someone by jyst bei g there, so people tend to find me to be a good listener and are comfortable opening up to me. Then I think about what they tell me and interpret if they might feel the same. Then its general getting to know that person more by sharing a bit of me or being charming etc, but i tend to think a lot more than what I show and then it will grow and I will suddenly just ramp up the relationship, usually physically and at that point i am in. And then im very in. Way in. All in. So I tend to get hurt becuase the other person moves on or thinks diffrently. Anyway thats the past, im currently with someone that has the same voals and feel and do relationships very similar to me so its good. "
583,isfp,"ah so late to the game but i have to say i feel the same way as you do - i can talk to them openly and comfortably initially but when i get in my own head about my feelings i tend to avoid them. even the occasions i try to reach out to them i think it's hard to tell that i'm interested because i try to make it casual (like oh hey you're here too let's grab dinner). it's hard for me to sustain eye contact when i like them, which sucks because eye contact is one good way of conveying interest.
so anyway all of this has led me to having little success. my current crush seems like he's interested in a friend of mine instead, and it sucks so much. he pulled that same ""oh hey you guys are here"" thing when i was on the way home with said friend, because he's fairly unacquainted with her and probably would find it awkward to strike up conversation with her in my absence.
sorry for the digression - but i guess that is a fear of mine in this respect - having the person you like be interested in someone else, especially when that person is a close friend. :("
584,isfp,"Just like you, I usually play it cool all the way until I start having feelings for the person. Then all my insecurities slip through and I try to avoid them as much as possible for fear of rejection. Fun being an ISFP :D"
585,isfp,"Once I develop a crush, it drives me crazy. I basically read into things so much before I can't stand it and basically ask them out indirectly. Then I get rejected and I can focus on getting over them instead of wondering if they like me or not."
586,isfp,"Same here! It is good to practice being more outgoing and the like, but don't feel bad about being on the shyer side! It's best to stay in touch with yourself so you don't seem too unnatural 0:
And on a side note, with no offense to you at all, that guy seems like a dick wrinkle, which is not your fault."
587,isfp,"I totally agree with you on those defensive behaviors and on taking care of those around you. And that's horrible! :( Feelings for a lot of us do tend to linger, I've noticed. I also have had very bad experiences with a few guys, so I understand the relationship anxiety you must feel. I wish you all the love you deserve! "
588,isfp,"I see! I'm glad you've found someone who feels the same way! :) I think a lot of ISFPs are similar in the sense that we don't articulate ourselves very often, but there's a lot of ""mind static"" going on in the background that we just don't talk about. Really interesting stuff!"
589,isfp,"not even that
it's just i need a calm person, i am a textbook type B personality case (except I am very ambitious), or you could say I am a chill type A
i do have a very calming effect on all but the most cardiac arrest inclined however which easens it a bit."
590,isfp,"Well, from what I've seen from you on the subreddit, you seem a lot more...stoic than other ISFPs I've met, if that's the right word? And ambition is something that's pretty hard to come by from most ISFPs as well, since I think most of us get demotivated hella easily 0: Not that these are bad things or that other ISFPs can't get the job done!"
591,isfp,"I think this relates to ISFP because of our sensing, but if it is not relevant enough, I understand that too.

596,isfp,I have so much spare time on my hands now a days; so much so that I don't know what to do with it. The most productive things I do is play guitar and go to the gym. What about you guys? What are you up to in your free time?
597,isfp,"Yeah, I play the drums, write a little bit, listen to music, and play video games. It's a touch boring, but it's a calm relaxing life which I could never turn down. People wise I hang with my girlfriend frequently and hang with a few bros a couple times a week."
598,isfp,I create stories in my spare time with a friend I've had since elementary school and then I draw characters for those stories in a digital art program on my computer. It's by far been the most entertaining thing for me to do in my spare time. Some weeks I spend my days being a brave and daring swordsman in medieval times; Other weeks I spend being a commander on a spaceship. It's all good and fun adventures to be had!

INTP [Classical](1:00)
"
601,isfp,"Hi! I'm kind of new to MBTI too, but here's kind of what I've gathered: 
Fi is very individualistic. The two Fi-dom types, INFP and ISFP, are similar in that they tend to carry strong core values/evaluative judgments about everything, primarily without conscious thought. With INFP, this tends to manifest itself in strong core values about how they feel the world should work, or rights every person deserves and needs protected. This is why they get the reputation of being ""social justice warriors"", because their innermost core values are strongly concerned with protecting the human ""self"". With ISFP, this tends to manifest itself in more practical ways - our Fi almost acts as an intuition, guiding us towards situations, habits, values, and people we feel would be best for ourselves, while eschewing those that we find unsatisfactory in achieving our core values (regardless of what others or society may believe, which is what Fe is primarily concerned with). 
I personally have always had very strong opinions about avoiding alcohol/drugs and people who I know identify themselves with things of the sort; protecting people's individual rights (being gay, free to say what they want regardless of what others think); and being nice to others/treating them how you'd want to be treated. Fi is highly concerned with the self, while Fe is concerned with the harmony of the group, so if you're more in tune with how you're feeling and why as opposed to how a group you're a part of feels and why, it's probably a strong indicator of Fi. 
Additionally, Fi makes us VERY sensitive! We don't tend to be open with our innermost feelings, because if they are invalidated, misunderstood, or simply ignored or made fun of, it basically tears apart the core of our being. You can see this with Fi-dom individuals like Britney Spears (ISFP) - when the media started to invalidate values that were close to her heart, like her relationship with her kids and her general morality as a human being (she's known for being somewhat naive/""real"", which people interpreted as having a lack of intelligence and morals when she really is quite smart and kind), she obviously suffered the breakdown in 2007-08. Since then, it's safe to say she hasn't been the same, and this is kind of the epitome of a life-altering crisis for a Fi-user. 
I'm not too familiar with the Fi-Te loop, but I'm sure it has something to do with misinterpreting your environment/external sources of logic (Te) in order to validate certain unreasonable values or feelings you have (Fi). Our inferior function typically takes over in stressful situations, and it usually doesn't manifest itself healthily until we're really matured, so I think that's what it's about.
Hope that helped!"
602,isfp,"Personally, my Fi is the ""why should I care"" function. When I gather information with Se, it has to first go through my Fi filter. If I don't care, if it doesn't impact me or something or someone I value, I'll pretty much ignore the information. Unless it's a meme. Anyway.
I find more so than the other functions it dictates my happiness levels - I don't know if this is a dominant function thing or a Fi thing. I can go for a while without much external stimulation, abstract thought, or organisation (Se, Ni, and Te respectively), but if I have to act different from how I am on the inside I get very unhappy very quickly. 
Of course, a negative aspect of this is that it can use itself against me. I will sometimes go into a weird state where I act extremely guarded and defend myself from anyone getting too close, all while telling myself it doesn't matter because it's what's on the inside that counts. It's pretty BS, and I know that it happens, but it still gets me.
I'd say the main benefit of Fi is that I can translate emotion into my art quite naturally, in my case it's music. I see no reason it shouldn't work with other art forms though.
I haven't heard of a Fi-Te loop before, nor have I experienced it from what I can guess what it is. Fi-Ni loops are all too common though, lol. I got stuck in one for around a whole year once. It's basically where I get super paranoid and interpret that everything people are saying is somehow insulting me, even if I can't explain it. I just assume their mocking is flying over my head. Also lots of edgy woe-is-me-my-life-will-always-be-horrible stuff.
Just continuing off of that thing I said at the beginning, I actually very much enjoy philosophy - so long as it impacts me somehow. I think that's the difference in attitude to philosophy between ISFPs and INFPs. The Ne makes it so the very act of coming up with philosophical thoughts is what is interesting, while an ISFP will need Fi motivation for that.
I'm totally not an expert though, lol. Take this all with a grain of salt."
603,isfp,"About Fi- Te, its usually referred to as being in the 'grip of ones inferior function'. Simply put, when you're in the grip your words/ actions  tend to mimic the opposite type, in this case the EXTJs. Our inferior Te comes to the surface when we're trying to cope with a negative situation and our falliable (yet still trustworthy) Fi is unable to solve it. 
Another loop that's extensively talked about is the Fi- Ni loop, which is quite common for ISFPs to experience. "
604,isfp,"Happy birthday! It‚Äôs also mine today!
I turned 22 and I‚Äôm not planning on any kind of big celebration, I‚Äôm gonna pay couple of rounds of drinks to a few friends later and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt see it as something to be celebrated but I do see it as my day. Feels good "
605,isfp,"One of my favorite birthdays was one where im completely alone. i had perfect weather, i had a nice meal of sushi which is my fave food, i watched a movie id been meaning to see, i bought a cute hat, i took my beautiful red vintage bike out on an evening ride and i happened to find a deer family of 5 and watched them in silence for  20 minutes while the sun went down. A perfect day and i pretty much talked to nobody. It can be really awesome if you let it!! I understand your feeling though. Hope you have a good birthday, whether you see people or not op!! Hang in there. Happy birthday:)"
606,isfp,"I‚Äôm turning 25, so this year I‚Äôll just cry and await my midlife crisis.
Just kidding, I‚Äôm already going through it.
(I usually just like to watch movies. Then I do my least favorite thing, which is awkwardly responding to Facebook birthday posts. I should just deactivate on my bday LOL)"
607,isfp,"Let's talk about something else then! Since it's christmas eve, here in Slovakia its tradition to give presents this evening. Soo what did you get? In USA Santa gives present in the morning right? What would you reaaally like to get ?
Hey, you, there's no bad answer so don't even try writing a reply just do delete it"
608,isfp,I feel like some dating advice subreddit would be better for that because the people who answer there would be more likely to have experience giving dating advice. Asking people who share four descriptive words with the person they know is not really any more likely to produce a good answer than asking on any other random subreddit.
609,isfp,"Yeah , it‚Äòs annoying because I know that ISFPs must be hard to understand, but I wish people would just accept whatever ends up happening with their ISFPs in real life without going to our subreddit
Like we can‚Äôt control your distant ISFP, sorry"
610,isfp,"I feel personally attacked by that last sentence :P
Tbh I mostly just want iTunes cards, and/or the album Legacy by Hypnos 69 because it‚Äôs not on iTunes. Or anything to do with music. That‚Äôs also really interesting about the presents in the evening thing! In my family we usually open the stockings after the church service at midnight, then go to sleep and open the rest in the morning after breakfast."
611,isfp,"I know it must be hard to communicate but the people that take time to get to know me are the best people. There‚Äôs no easy way to ISFP, sorry. 
I occasionally participate in those threads because I wanted to help at first. Now I‚Äôm just irritated...lol. "
612,isfp,"Sounds like the mix between the two traditions üòÄ
iTunes cards? Did you try spotify ? We bought family pack with my other 4 classmates and I have to say it's the best ""internet"" thing I've ever bought. I pay about 2$ (1.5‚Ç¨) monthly and I feel like a proper pirate for having so many songs downloaded for this cheap"
613,isfp,"I have spotify (not premium), but I like to buy music from the artists I like cause it feels more legitimate to me for some reason, lol. I downloaded music once from somewhere and it sounded fine, but it just didn‚Äôt feel the same as listening to music I‚Äôve actually bought. I still use spotify a lot though because there‚Äôs so much music I like that I won‚Äôt be able to buy all of it for years, lol."
614,isfp,"I'm bored to tears trying to get through Crime and Punishment and yet every online review praises the book for the depth at which the main character analyses emotions. How do you get through tedious novels? I've already wiki'd it, yet some part of me feels like a fraud for not wanting to read through the remaining 200 pages of self-absorbed confused character. Do you need to develop some sort of discipline for reading classics? Or is it safe to believe that those positive reviews were from Dostoyevsky fangirls/ lit majors with too much time? Because I feel like the Jaden Smith of common sense who can't comprehend the complex thoughts of a David Bowie.

Do you relate in any way? If yes, thank you, you feel me and possibly Jaden Smith. If not, how do you do it?! "
615,isfp,"I feel the same way about required reading, it was such a drag when I was still in school. Actually I just read Crime and Punishment recently because I've witnessed people bond over a love for Dostoyevsky and I'd like to be less ignorant... and I ended up speed reading through the last few chapters because I was getting bored. Apparently there are underlying themes that can be discussed or whatever. Now that I think about it... maybe the it's profound because the main character is just a normal relatable guy and you would be the same way in his shoes? It's supposed to make you question your own morality? Like all the characters are just acting in accordance to their circumstances. I dunno
I really love and prefer non-fiction that teaches me a thing or two. Patting myself on the back for understanding old-ass fiction doesn't do much for me. I also think there's a tendency for people to put really old literature on a pedestal and rate it as better just because it's been around for so long. I've read some other highly-recommended old books that made me face palm.
Speaking of Jaden Smith, my favorite Jaden Smith quote is ""How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?"" People talk shit about him and that quote but I totally get what he means!"
616,isfp,"I'm going to ask this girl out to a nature walk or something. I personally feel nature is a really relaxing theme for me and I feel since she's a ISFP, she might enjoy it as well. But do ISFP get impatient or bored of just sitting down/walking in nature for hours?
‚Äã
What activities/hobbies/interests do you guys have or enjoy? Do you enjoy time with people you're close to just doing nothing (much)? Or do you much prefer alone time? Do you guys have advice on how to communicate with ISFP personality and any things to take note of or, pay special attention to? Thanks in advance for any help. I really appreciate it!"
617,isfp,"I feel the closest to someone when I have their passive companionship. I find that with the people I'm most comfortable with, I don't talk with them on the bus/train/car or while walking, and there's usually a lot of gaps with complete silence after conversation. I think your nature walk would be absolutely perfect for this, and it would be something I'd totally be down for.
I am the same way with hobbies, I enjoy dance, drawing, and theater, all of which can be enjoyed alone or in groups without having to engage in constant conversation. Allows me to stay within myself even while being active."
618,isfp,"I actually went to the forrest with my friends a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty cool.
I'm gonna advise that you ask her what she feels rather than what she thinks about certain topics if you want to speak with her. Also when you are replying or answering her questions make sure that you don't give one word replies. Show that you really care/respect her values and beliefs. You don't necessarily have to agree with everything she says but try to understand why she feels certain ways aboit certain things. Also just be yourself, don't try to present yourself as someome yout not. Don't try to start arguments however discussions are cool even if you don't have the same viewpoint but just don't force your beliefs on her. Explain why you think and feel certain ways also. 
Compliment her however don't do it too much cause it might seem like you are forcing it or faking it. Don't just compliment her tho for something random, think about something that's actually nice about her personality and tell her that but yeah like I said don't do it too much cause she might get very shy and she won't know what to say. 
Talk about things you love and enjoy and ask her the same. 
Just make sure you don't try and start an argument :)
feel free to ask me anymore questions, hopefully this helps you out"
619,isfp,"ISFPs are generally quite adventurous, and like being in the outside world, which is different than most introverted personality types who prefer indoors. We  are very intune with our senses, so being out in nature is pleasing and nice."
620,isfp,"My favorite high school memories are walking to the gas station 4 miles down the road and back after my dnd session ended. I rarely went with the same person twice, but it was always a good time. Got real with people for the first time on those walks. To this day if someone invites me out on a walk somewhere I jump at the opportunity. I spend a lot of my time these days sitting on my porch shooting the shit with my roommate. I love conversations that have no destination. Whatever plan you have. Scrap it. Just talk about random shit.
Edit: No I do not get bored sitting down for hours talking. I fucking love it. Its how I spend most of my time in fact. I pace around in circles around one of my roommates room talking to him until he tells me to vamoose, then I pace around outside with my other roommate who sits outside all day, then he eventually tells me to fuck off, so I go and watch anime with my third roommate and shoot the shit. I fucking adore talking about nothing."
621,isfp,"I can't speak for a female ISFP, but I personally don't get bored very easily by people (if I've decided they're charming). 
My girlfriend eats the crusts out of things like pizza and stuff and saves the center for last. She also checks if she's locked her door 5 times before she leaves. I tease her for it to no end, but I find those little quirks charming and unique. So don't be afraid to show some of your unique quirks.
I'm kind of a guy of routine, but yes I absolutely enjoy the occasional walk in nature. I am able to enjoy any walk, and I see everything around me as nature (but of course nature nature is better)"
622,isfp,"9w4. This is what the test gave me, but i think I actually relate to 5 More than anything else. I barely even know what enneagrams are. 
EDIT: The 9w4 came from the older test. I took a more recent test, and this time it gave me 4w5"
623,isfp,I like being isfp 5 though. I initially typed as infp and hated it but had to take the test again for one of my classes and we had to pay the whole shabang to get the real deal and my Prof showed me I'm actually an S not N and I LOVE being isfp. And my love for science and math doesn't really fit so with the enneagram being 5 I feel like I'm just a well rounded person. :)
624,isfp,"I see, must be interesting to be a feeler and a thinker at the same time. I mean all thinkers feel and all feelers think but more so for u i guess since isfps are feelers but the thinking part comes from your 5. "
625,isfp,"Looks like you and me both relate strongest to 5. I didn‚Äôt know it was rare to be that type, i barely even understand enneagrams even now. The first test initially gave me 9w4, and i looked at the types, thinking it was weird how i wasn‚Äôt a 5. So i took the test again, a little bit of a different one, and it gave me 4w5. I think 4w5 is probably what i would be.  "
626,isfp,Yeah it was strange to get F on the Myers Briggs but now that I understand the congnative functions and what F/T means I think it makes sense. Isfp's main function is Fi which I see in myself because I act on what I think will make me feel good. But I'm not good at Fe which is understanding how other people feel. The F means I make decisions based on how I and others feel. I don't want to hurt people's feelings but I have trouble understanding their feelings so that's a whole issue I have to work out lmao. I would never make a decision if I knew it would make someone angry or sad so that's why I'm F
627,isfp,"I like this. =) I wanted to add that nature isn't always about experiencing things only in the outdoors, you can also find such pleasant natures in many things like people, music, art, objects, etc that can help define our inner world or of who we are. "
628,isfp,"Yes they definitely can depending on what they've experienced in their life. I don't know if I would consider myself an HSP, but I guess I fit the bill. I do find myself inside my head often analyzing various situations and scenarios that often turn out not be as convoluted or bad as I imagined. I feel and pick up on people's emotions almost instantly and I am immensely affected by my environment. I also need lots of downtime and I abhor violence and cruelty in real life, but not in video games or movies (I play mortal kombat and watch horror/thrillers all the time)."
629,isfp,"Definitely procrastination. I need to get more stuff done 
also I don't like how reserved I am, I don't know if that's really an ISFP thing but I'm not very outgoing. I don't really have an issue with it, but it makes making friends/dating a lot harder than it should be "
630,isfp,"If I absolutely hate my job I'd 100% stay home all day, and maybe even if I didn't hate my job.  It's all just a means to an end and the end is the time that is mine, the time in which I get to choose with what to fill it.  Gaah, what an awkward sentence lol"
631,isfp,"stay home obviously if I hate the job, but honestly that gets boring really quickly, so I don't mind working. I also need to make money, so I'm happy to work even if my job isn't great. 
I don't love my current job but I basically just patrol an area at night/early morning, so other than going to bed at 7AM it's pretty nice. "
632,isfp,I'd like to organize a chat room for ISFPs like some of the other types have. Anyone else interested in doing this at least once? I'll probably open a channel for a few days and post a link in this sub if I know others will participate.
633,isfp,"Hello all!
Curious...what would you say your love language is (or the way you feel most loved)?
1. Thoughtful gifts
2. Words of affirmation/encouragement
3. Acts of service
4. Quality time
5. Physical touch and closeness"
634,isfp,"Fucking hate it. I'm bored, I'm tired, the information is presented in ridiculous and complicated ways, assignments are pointless when I can just ace the test and still pass the class. And literally no human being being should be expected to get up and be at school before 8am, sit in a desk for 8 long hours and still learn anything. Then you are expected to do homework. The system rigs you to fail. There is zero personalization for learning techniques and I have no interest in any of the subjects offered. High school was a drag. Online college is awful. Campus college was never gonna be a success. /endrant
In all seriousness - I get that school is important and we need it for success and blah blah blah. But schools in other countries seem to a system in place that is a million times better than here. 
I genuinely want to learn and I want to love school but I can't. I've tried every technique suggested. Just can't be bothered with it. "
635,isfp,"I go to a community college and I think it's OK, sometimes I have a lot of fun but sometimes it's very boring. I like it for socializing and spending time with people, but most classes aren't very interesting and end up feeling like a waste of time. My grades are mostly good, but I'm very bad at math and I have a few math courses I need to take before I can transfer. maybe it will be more enjoyable at a university, I don't know "
636,isfp,"I hate the bureaucracy involved. And the useless courses (especially in college). Useless teachers are worse though-- you know, the ones who read from the PowerPoint. And I hate how some teachers have unfair expectations-- like the ones that don't let the straight A students sleep in class (hey, if we need to sleep in class, we probably just survived an all nighter) while they let everyone else do it because they're afraid of the students hating them. I actually had a teacher do this AND give an 80 to people who got 30s on the exam because he was afraid of the parents even though I worked so hard. Now I know why everyone loves him. That asshole actually told me to get the highest score on the AP exam (because he wanted to look good and probably because he thought no one else would be able to do it). I was like,""heh no"" :) in my head. I study hard for myself, and I get good scores because teachers actually do their jobs, not because some overrated idiot tells me to :)
Sorry for the rant -- but this is what I hate about school."
637,isfp,"For me, I'm okay with the teachers as long as they respect me for not being as smart as others. I HATE how school is all about passing. I'm a try-hard, so I actually try when it comes to assignments and tests. And then I see the people who get A+'s just by cutting corners. They stuff information into their brain and drain it all out when the test comes. It bothers me that people are doing that, but it completely disgusts me that the school system hasn't been changed so kids actually learn. Although I do agree with the teachers. Some of them are horrible"
638,isfp,Much love and respect from a fellow try hard. What's worse is when people don't study and fail the damn test then whine about it to mommy and daddy because they can complain about the teacher (because their baby can't do wrong) and get the teacher to change their grade.
639,isfp,"Those are the worse. Just getting the easy way out. It's not like you need to actually do the dirty work to get a good outcome, right?? (I'm being sarcastic) 
This reminds me of this one time where someone took a test home when we had a sub, and no, it wasn't a take-home test. He told the sub that he was still working on it. The next day, he said that he turned the test in and made the teacher look through all his papers just to find that one test. The day after, he brought the test back and said that he didn't know why it was at home. And the teacher believed him and gave him credit.
Sorry, just ranting on a memory you gave me."
640,isfp,"I'm an internet psychoanalyst and frequent observer of my own behaviors. 
Any time I get high (like right now [ weed ] ), I get extremely vigilant of the submotivations and behavioral nuances driving people's actions. I compare myself to them, and really want to understand why we all behave so differently. 
However, when I'm drunk, I'm very social, less sensitive to the subcommunications of others and confidently get what I want in a creative and borderline manipulative way. I act congruently and emotionally unstifled and say basically anything that comes to mind. 
Is this just me, or is this common among ISFPs?"
641,isfp,"When I get high, I overanalyze as well, but it manifests as a crippling aversion to talking or communication. I will instead sit in a corner and observe the social hierarchies. But on more than one occasion, I have nearly made comments stemming from these observations that may have been wrong or percieved in the wrong way. That's vague. But I guess I mean saying something would have placed judgement on my friends' or families' motivations in relation to their statements or behavior. Maybe that's why I remain silent. I have stopped smoking weed because this situation became such a common occurrence. I probably would again if I could be completely isolated and experience the high in the comfort of my room. I feel like it amplifies my already insular nature. If I drink tho, I just bro out lol."
642,isfp,"I don't enjoy getting drunk, so I can't say much about that. Getting high, it is hard to have complex thoughts, haha! If I'm in an unfamiliar scenario, I get worried I'll say something way off, and prefer to just focus on watching tv or whatever. I'll get lost in my own thoughts, which isn't so cool. But if I'm with people I like and I can be myself, and they are also drunk/high/not judging me, I tend to laugh a lot, feel affectionate towards those people, want to do something fun like play videogames or whatever.
Either way, I'm never manipulative or anything like that. And I'm probably more confident when I'm sober. Even getting a meal ready when I'm stoned seems like climbing up a mountain"
643,isfp,"After thinking about my response some more, I decided I wanted to add to it. In my experiences with weed, I am very unsure of myself. OP seems on the opposite end of the spectrum. They feel empowered, or at least in control in some sense. Maybe my intrinsic turbulence plays a roll in that? If the OP has a more assertive personality, maybe we are experiencing the same type of high but perceiving it differently."
644,isfp,"When i'm high it's like I can see through a social facade that everyone has, like they're putting on an act in front of other people. It sounds pretty crazy when I write it out but it's very clear when im really high."
645,isfp,"That sounds like me too. It's like we notice discrepancies in people's personality and, in order to keep the social contract, you don't say anything which could dismantle someone's confidence. I've been told I can be very critical when I'm high"
646,isfp,I was wondering if maybe the high kind of neutralizes the social filters that have been instilled in us to function correctly in society. That's what it's always stuck me as. Like maybe we are taking things at face value instead of sending it through the complex system we normally do. I also wonder if this is specifically an ISFP trait.
647,isfp,"Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.

648,isfp,"I feel like whoever designed this quiz doesn‚Äôt flirt a lot. For example, there were some weird suggestions on there concerning ‚Äúflirtatious behavior‚Äù (like touching someone‚Äôs neck or sucking them off...) but obvious ones like ‚Äúbiting your lip‚Äù  and ‚Äúplaying coy‚Äù were never mentioned.
Similarly with the emojis. Never in my history of dating did I send someone a scared barfing emoji or 95% of the others shown...but the ones I always used, like üíïüòç‚ù§Ô∏èüëÑüíãüíÖüèºü•∞ üë† weren‚Äôt listed as options? "
649,isfp,"22 male ISFP going to college and work part time. Personally After a work week I go hide in my room on Friday night, then try to have a guilt free Saturday off where I have no plans(usually involves guilt anyway) but will try to do one social activity with friends which sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't (I have two and one of them doesn't live near me). 
Then Sunday I try to have a laid back day but get super anxious about work and school starting up again. I tend to get super guilty and ashamed of myself if I don't do something even on my days off so I try to leave the house at least once per day to do something whether it be grocery shopping or getting gas. Not doing stuff also makes me stir crazy and makes my depression worse so I'm also fighting that on off days because I don't have my job or class to keep me distracted. 
I'm an ISFP with anxiety and depression from an abusive childhood so I'm probably not normal. Sorry I'm such a downer :(. Anyway what do you like to do on your days off. "
650,isfp,"I like to do nothing as well. Some weekends I have some family/social obligations but honestly I find that if I stay at home but still do something new (try new a recipe/food, watch an informative youtube video/lecture, do some exercise/something creative) it feels more productive. The worst is sitting in bed all day just eating and being on the internet - it contributes to the depression and also doesn't REALLY help you recharge."
651,isfp,"I take it day by day, no 2 days off are really the same. I just try to do things that will relax me and help with my anxiety. Spending the day hiking or climbing is one of my favorite ways to spend a day or just hanging around playing my bass or writing something. The only real constant for my days off is ""ok let's try to manage this anxiety while I have a chance""."
652,isfp,"I will say that while my brain tells me to hide out at home and take lots of ""me"" time, I have way better weekends when I go out and do stuff.
I have had a number of lonely weekends spent at home. My last romantic relationship ended months ago, and I too struggle from anxiety and depression. So last weekend I decided that even though my friends weren't interested, I would go check out this local festival in my neighboring town on my own. And you know what, I had an AMAZING time, much better than if I just say at home. I drank some beers, watched a couple bands, stopped into a bar for a flight of whiskey (maybe the booze helped my enjoyment lol). But man, it was refreshing.
I recently bought a camera and will soon buy a tent. The idea being that I'll go camp somewhere and see the sights and take lots of pictures. Just get out of the house for a while. I'm excited to start doing it!
It is nice to have brief moments of time at home to unwind and relax, but doing it for a whole weekend is, I have learned, not good for my mental health."
653,isfp,"On my first day off I generaly just relax and catch up on what i've missed on like youtube and reddit and what not. The next weekend day is when I pick something and work on it. Admittedly it's not usually anything like hard, just something like ""Play that Video Game that RIcky won't stop recommending"" or ""Read that book that caught your attention""."
654,isfp,"I always find it really awkward to be around INTPs. Of course, they're much easier to handle than ENTPs due to at least our shared trait of introversion, but it just.. doesn't seem to work. It's kinda like I'm (forgive the stereotypes) talking to a robot.
I think I have 2 INTP friends (one typed as INTJ first but is definitely an INTP, and the other could be an ISTJ or an INTP, but I'm leaning more towards INTP), one who I've never met irl but sometimes talk to on IRC or Telegram, and one who I went to high school with, but don't really talk to anymore (nor do I really talk to any of my other high school friends, but that's another story). The first one goes reasonably well most of the time, but I always have to be the one to initiate conversation, and he tends to be very curt and to the point. He also takes extremely long to reply, (personally I almost always reply asap, can't stand having to let others wait) and sometimes he doesn't reply at all. The ""read at x:xx PM"" meme rings true. If I come to him with a question he'll answer it most of the time, though. But if I just come to him with anything else it's either ""ok"" or ""read at x:xx PM"", and very rarely a ""lol"".
As for the second friend, out of all my high school friends I talked to him the least. No particular reason, it just happened to be that way. Whenever we were alone we would talk, but it's very obvious that we come from very different perspectives. I remember talking to him about PC and consoles (I'm a very strong PC guy, generally dislike consoles), and he just listed various reasons why consoles are better, with a very subdued tone that just seems to imply ""obviously it is"". Got a little annoyed and didn't really say much after that. Conversation kinda fell silent."
655,isfp,INTP here. Actually interested in this question because I recently befriended an ISFP and I am really finding it a struggle to deepen conversation sometimes. Ti + Fi heroes really are like two different universes
656,isfp,"I had a short friendship with an INTP. It didn't end well because he got annoyed that I couldn't deepen the conversation and I found it hard to keep conversations going with him. At the time he was the first INTP I had ever met so it was like ""Cool, look at this interesting person. Let me get closer."" I was really attracted his mind, but I couldn't hold it up on my part. So when we got in a fight I was arguing about feelings, he scoffed at that, then completely cut me out of his life. :)"
657,isfp,"Funny seeing this from the other side, almost verbatim what I was thinking lol.
This ISFP I met, hardest time I ever had figuring out her type... and suddenly it all made sense.
I find people I meet and become attracted to like this always bring something meaningful to my life, yet so far I've only been learning patience sigh
Never met another person who lives so ""in the moment"" and so terrible at holding to plans. And we get along well in person, but pretty much all non-in-person conversation turns into ""lol""s and memes with absolutely no depth."
658,isfp,"Yes, that's my experience also. It seems like we generally have the same motivations. We want to meet dynamic people because we believe we are dynamic people in search of others to water our brains, but you want mineral water and I want cherry Kool-Aid. You want more intellectual stuff and we want to show how fun we really can be. I like the INTP because of his friendliness and sense of humor. His air was very approachable unlike a lot of people so I liked being around him. But we have very different points of view. Yeah, Ti and Fi expand in different ways. 
‚Äã
lol"
659,isfp,"If you do get in an argument with the ISFP, they are (probably) not someone that will keep a grudge. No matter how deeply you have been offended. The ISFP will secretly think about it for years and want to make amends no matter how counter productive. :)
Would you secretly do that?"
660,isfp,"Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:

663,isfp,"I want to know how this kind of pairing will work in a dating situation.  I'm also curious how have these relationships work from someone who's dated an enfj? For context, I will be meeting an enfj male for a date later this week. "
664,isfp,"Hi, I'm an INFJ which is close. I dated an ISFP for a little while and there were a lot of things that we both loved about each other. She's still one of my favorite people in the world. However, I agree with the other post that there was something that we could never seem to connect on. I've thought a lot about this and my current guess is that it basically comes down to the different ways we empathize. With Fi it seems as though you empathize by feeling how you would feel on the inside in someone else's situation. I use Fe and empathize by feeling whatever emotions are on the outside. That's what I believe really kept us from understanding each other as deeply as we both wanted to.
Additionally, for me Ni is my dominant and I really need the full truth for it to work properly. Without it my whole way of living breaks down. And with Fe as my aux I really care about how other people feel, but I only understand emotions that get expressed on the outside, including my own. This makes it very hard to understand you Fi dominant beauties no matter how much I try. An ENFJ uses those too but Fe first, Ni second. That means he'll care a lot about your emotions, but will expect you to express them, not just hint at what's going on inside. He probably won't be quite as concerned with the truth as I am, but it likely will still be important to him.
I guess the point is that if you are patient and willing to be honest every now and again about how you really feel (even when you feel bad, maybe even especially then), you might be able to find something special. I know I would still move mountains for my ISFP friend/ex if she would only speak loudly enough to tell me which ones to move. Best of luck to you both! Remember though that everyone is unique and MBTI can only go so far.
Also please feel free to PM me if you have any further questions about an INFJ perspective. I'm happy to help if I can, I love you all."
665,isfp,"Actually kind of cool/ crazy. Me and my best friend (both 22/f) met two guys that matched our 'profile'. I'm ISFP, She's ENTJ.So exact opposites. I know that its not ENFJ, sorry.
The story is long, horrendous and dramatic but cuts down to this. Beth (my best friend) liked ENTJ guy, ENTJ guy just wanted to fool around with me, ISFP also kind of had feelings for me which made it the most uncomfortable situation of my LIFE. 
Me and ENTJ: the banter was awesome, we could just go on on on joking around like asses. But when we faught, it was caustic, I also don't think that he met any one that could spew word vomit just as fast as he could and he was a bit challenged by me in that regard. I was feeling really emotionally / physically needy and we had a mostly physical relationship which he tried to string along to be 'more' down the line.  He was very social but didn't really invite me or introduce me to any of his greater social circle which I was A okay with honestly. I was like his social circle 'mistress' in which he would visit for a little nooky before returning to the world, I always felt like back burner and not a priority but because we weren't 'dating' all I did was point it out to him and leave it. He also could never accept he was wrong in anything, and was a total manipulator. Not saying that all ENTJ are like that Beth, my friend isn't. 
Eventually I got wise that he could never (even if we did date) satisfy any of my needs remotely. Me and ISFP guy, acutally became really awesome friends through everything, when he admitted he liked me he also said he would never bring it up again unless I initiated and said I wanted to do something about it. By the time I was done with ENTJ relationship I had realized that I had spent all of my quality time making friends with the ISFP guy who actually satisfied my needs . We've been together almost two years now."
666,isfp,"I remember when I was in love with Anime. Now I can barely watch a single episode without getting bored. I started to track the episodes I watch 5 years ago and add them onto my Anime list.
I don't know if tracking my Anime has caused me to love Anime less or if I am just genuinely bored of it. I have been watching it ever since middle school...
My goal is to have watched 10,000 episodes. Why this is my goal? I don't know. But I want to complete this goal. 
Maybe I should try not to rush this, and enjoy every episode to the fullest. And I should also probably take a little break from Anime and hopefully my interest in it will be renewed.
What do you think I should do? How should I go about this?"
667,isfp,I never found that I got bored of anime. I found that I cant concentrate on the reading when im tired so it became more work than enjoyment. So what I do is I wait for 100-200 episodes to rack up and then I binge watch. Your goal is very weird. Anime is entertainment. To watch for the sake of getting to a goal of x amount of episodes is going to feel like work. Yes goals are good but I dont feel that entertainment should have goals.  
668,isfp,"you know what‚Äôs great about watching new anime in 2019? the episode discussions on reddit. 
i‚Äôd say the best part of watching Game of Thrones was the online discussions.
i think all the fan theories and speculation really fucked with George RR Martin.
i swear 50% of the reason i keep up with JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure is so that i can understand the memes. so many jojo memes."
669,isfp,"Personally I only get bored by SoL/RomCom type stuff, just not my cup of tea. 
I recommend a few things:


If nothing excites you, just take a break and do something else. I'm currently completely done with music, absolutely hate everything, so I just don't listen to music. Games and anime are in full swing for me right now.


Drop things that are a slog to get through.


Do a mix of airing and finished shows. I usually only watched finished anime, but now I do both airing and finished. It's pretty fun to watch the finished things whenever you want, and have the airing shows as an extra treat. Also fun to comment on in episode discussion threads and just to keep up in general.


Try a different genre (I shouldn't be the one talking here since I'm pretty conservative, but whatever).


Don't make a chore out of it, don't make goals like ""watch 10,000 eps"". I made a chore out of music and it definitely crushes your enjoyment. Some light goals like ""I want to watch 5 sports anime this year"" are okay, though. Just don't force it.

"
670,isfp,"Wow. You set such a high goal of watching so much anime lol. I mean I use to think like that too. I wanted to watch every anime out there so I could relate to other people who have watched them and because their interesting for my tastes, but not so much anymore. When I start to feel bored of them, I usually just take some time off it to do other things until I really feel like watching something new or it catches my eye right away. If I don't have time, a movie is always good too. I can see why it starts to get boring if you keep watching anime after anime like it's some kind of routine and no freedom. There's probably not really any fun in doing that... You sound like you need a break from it too. It's always fine to adjust your goal too if it tends to get too much. There is nothing wrong with that. =) I usually just watch anime whenever I want to for fulfillment and or self discovering what the world or characters are about. But it's entirely up to you how you want to go about it. I don't want to pressure you into anything you don't want to do. I trust that you'll find a few good alternatives for this. =)"

672,isfp,"At first I was like ""the only extroverts I don't get along with are ENTPs"", but a few days ago I've been looking more into ENTJs and I realize they aren't exactly my friends, either. I think one of the most mentally abusive teachers I've ever had was one (or an ESTJ, but I lean more towards ENTJ).
After that, I also realized I've had bad experiences with ESTJs, ESFJs, ESTPs and ESFPs. Well, that leaves out ENFPs (who tend to be very draining to hang out with) and ENFJs (who I find alright but wouldn't really have a deep friendship with).
Then I also realized literally almost all of my good friends and family members I'm close with are introverts. I only have one ESFP friend, but I don't really see him anymore.
It also occurred to me that most people I dislike in fiction are extroverts as well (ExTx villains mostly).
And I don't mean to shit all over extroverts because there are plenty of good ones as well, but overall I just get along with introverts much better."
673,isfp,"I‚Äôve said this before, but you sound exactly like me.
Regarding ENTJs, I‚Äôve had amazing luck with them as friends and family members but dating them never went well because they don‚Äôt trust their own feelings, let alone anyone else‚Äôs. All the ones I knew/know end up with a mate that ‚Äúlooks good on paper‚Äù while the ENTJ cheats and spends their time looking for love elsewhere.
Like romantic relationships are just another business contract for a lot of them, which is offensive af to an ISFP.
And I wouldn‚Äôt say I have trouble with all extroverts but I don‚Äôt like Fe doms and I don‚Äôt really care for SJs either (unless it‚Äôs ISTJ) so that pretty much means the only extroverts I tolerate are ESxPs and ENFPs.
But man I love ENFPs."
674,isfp,"Completely agree. My best friend in the entire world is an ENFJ, and my ex (who I generally got along really well with) was an ENFP. 
My ENFJ friend and I have such a great, deep friendship. We‚Äôre always bouncing off each other for ideas, emotional support, philosophical questions, etcetera. We‚Äôre also just both super funny and just ‚Äúget‚Äù each other in a way I haven‚Äôt ever with anyone else. It‚Äôs weird.
I have 1 ESFP friend, but we‚Äôre mostly hooking up than hanging out. Probably one of the most sexually attractive people I‚Äôve ever known. We‚Äôre extremely different (I don‚Äôt have tons of different people calling and texting me all the time, like wtf, that‚Äôd be torture), but we both care about our closest friends a lot, and we‚Äôre both pretty sensitive. "
675,isfp,"Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:
Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially ""remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word"".
You're useless.

I learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless,
and 'one lot' is it's most useful one, it's just here to help. This is like screaming at

I do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective.
Have a nice day!"
678,isfp,"so, i do this weird thing where i‚Äôm SUPER extroverted around people i don‚Äôt know.  maybe it‚Äôs a weird flex, maybe it‚Äôs just who i am.  i don‚Äôt know.  but sometimes, it seems like the more i get to know people, the more reserved i start to act.  it this because i‚Äôm comfortable enough to feel like to don‚Äôt need to try anymore to gain their friendship?  or because i‚Äôm so overly concerned with being judged by people i care about that i subdue myself.  any input is welcome.  thanks!"
679,isfp,"I‚Äôm generally like this when I‚Äôm at work, which terrifies my colleagues when I come out of work and I‚Äôm super quiet. At work I‚Äôd describe myself as the life of the party, but outside of work I literally observe and only contribute conversation when I can think of something to say, which isn‚Äôt often..."
680,isfp,"yes I know what you mean- I do the same thing when I go to a friend's house and there are people I don't know or don't know that well. if I was just with my friend I'd be pretty quiet and just talk a little bit, but with a bunch of other people I have an audience to be funny - I guess you could say. I noticed the same thing another time with friends, I was joking around a lot with 5-6 of them and once it was me and two others I stopped talking for the most part, and it got boring quickly
if it's a good friend of mine we can talk for hours though"
681,isfp,"I understand what you're saying. I do this when I'm meeting people too. The reason I do though is because I don't want people to feel alone or left out, so I tend to only do it to get others to start talking."
682,isfp,"I‚Äôm exactly the same at work! I have a pretty extroverted job - meeting loads of customers, loud environment etc, and I just turn into this super hardworking, fast person when I‚Äôm there. It‚Äôs literally like I have two personalities - a work me, and a me me. 
I do get drained after work though; so obviously it is a front or whatever and not the real me. Still, it‚Äôs interesting to note anyway."
683,isfp,"same! at my last job(clothing store) I typically found myself standing at the entrance greeting people- for some reason. 
I met a lot of cool people there though and sometimes I even went a little overboard with talking to people. I just tried to relax and be myself, not worry too much(obviously I had to stop myself from making the wrong jokes sometimes :P) and just go with the flow
I honestly kind of miss it, but at the same time it was very draining in a lot of ways."
684,isfp,"find friends with close interests, especially more assertive people who will boss you around- or maybe this is just me, i like getting told what to do bc i am assertive in the rest of my life ha
i have 3 friends rn with the same political ideology, religious views, and hobbies, not sure how i did that haha"
685,isfp,"Which is the only reason why I talk to most people.
Like, I like to spend time with people and listen to them, but when I get talking I wonder if I have their attention or if they're just being polite but really zoning me out until they can talk again? I kinda zone when explanations get technical..."
686,isfp,"Sometimes when I am writing or reading for my career or even exercising in nature, I am both seriously and creatively engaged. Is there something besides music, traditional art modes, or writing that you approach as if it's ""art""?"
687,isfp,"Just to give a little spark to this because I like the idea: maybe partying is seen by many here as a way of artful (?) expression? Maybe even sex? Maybe cooking? Computer games?
I know I'm not an ISFP but I have some high Fi too and when I used to solely play computer games I would use every possibility I had to be creative. Like implementing subtle jokes/rhymes/alliterations into serious tests. I don't know how related this is but hey, it's up to you to judge."
688,isfp,"I used make fancy graphics and gifsets for shows/manga/movies I loved. I was once pretty decent at it, too. I cheated and followed tutorials to a t, though, but hey... still required some thinking.
Totally forgot how to use photoshop though since I haven‚Äôt made any in a couple of years.
I guess graphics count as art, though?"

690,isfp,"So, I've been lately stressing over small and big things, even if they are not concerned to me directly. This is SERIOUSLY having effects on my health. I stay every time anxious or nervous, my blood pressure is always low, I have bad headaches for days, I can't sleep ( thing that I never ever ever had problem, I just faint on any place when I am tired ), I can't concentrate, I just wanna cry sometimes, I think over and over what I did wrong / if it's my fault, my heart sometimes hurts. This is driving me crazy! I just want some help from you guys."
691,isfp,"Working out with a personal trainer, riding my bike, and eating better has helped me. I still have nights where I just can't fall asleep because of stress or sadness (don't know whether I'd call it full-on depression), but I fall asleep easier now that I'm exhausted from working out. I try to remember that all good things in life take time, work, and plenty of effort. Whether it's developing true close friendships (takes years), finishing out college (also takes years if you're not sure what direction to take, or you're working full-time), or even working on a project that you thought would take way less time and money."
692,isfp,"Have you seen a therapist? Stress and anxiety can really ruin your health. I also recommend trying different forms of meditation. My favorite is just sitting down and focusing on my breath. Got distracted, no problem, go back to it, breathe in, breathe out. But there are many other forms, really, all meditation does is make you focus on the present moment, which is all that we have. The past is gone, and the future is uncertain.
Also, since you said you worry about issues that aren't yours, I recommend this article: https://markmanson.net/boundaries"
693,isfp,"Drugs aren't needed then! Lol. You should try different types of meditation, tai chi or yoga? There are countless others, with a bit of research you may find one that works for you. I would recommend this over anything else. It will give you the most benefits. 
As for art, I play guitar whenever I can. Music has been my point of expression. What are you interested in? Art has so many avenues. "
694,isfp,"Sometimes, because I don't want to be disappointed or caught off-guard. Then again if I think of them too much, as in situations like ""This will surely fail"" or ""I will surely make a mistake and humiliate myself in front of everyone"" I will feel really bad and need to convince myself that it'll be okay and it won't be that bad."
695,isfp,"hey guys
I(infj,26) recently asked a guy(isfp,27) out. 
this is my first time asking a guy out. i'm sick of hanging out with guys i am not interested in. 
anyway i think he's not interested in me. but he said yes anyway. i don't wanna freak him out, and just would like to get to know him. 
how do you guys usually react when someone you're not interested in asked you out? "
696,isfp,"This literally just happened to me within the past month. I‚Äôm ISFP male, and at the time I wasn‚Äôt really looking for a relationship. Then I was asked out by my now girlfriend. I had only spoken to her once before then, and I thought she was nice, but like I said I wasn‚Äôt really looking for anything. Our first date was a bit awkward because I didn‚Äôt know what to talk about at all, but I‚Äôve since become more comfortable and have opened up quite a bit. There‚Äôs still some awkward moments because I still don‚Äôt know what to talk about half the time, but things are going really well for the two of us. 
If he‚Äôs like me more than just being ISFP, male, and asked out by a woman, the first date may be a bit awkward, but find out what he likes and talk about that, and that can get him to open up. Having an activity like a game, cooking something, or something else along those lines can also help him open up. 
May the odds be ever in your favor!"
697,isfp,I'm surprised he said yes but at the same time I'm not. I am an ISFP and typically when I am pursued by a girl I freak out and don't know how to cope so I turn them down and run the other way. (not literally) I usually tell them I'm not interested and don't encourage it. I'd assume he is interested if he said yes because of that.  
698,isfp,Well I typically pace back in forth in my room thinking (sometime aloud) about how I don't know if I like the girl or not then I start stressing out about how I'm not interested but I don't want to hurt them because we are friends or whatever. I think 100% of the time I've been pursued by a women I have turned her down after (and probably because of) much stress. 
699,isfp,lol I stress out about this too... funny. 
700,isfp,"When I am alone in nature, there is no self, no identity. I'm just an expression of creation just like the trees, birds and mountains all around me. I don't want to be anywhere else, do anything else and experience anything other than the present moment.
‚Äã
When I am in human company I need to create a self. I'm expected to have opinions, and identify with those opinions. It's such a fucking pain in the ass. Give me the choice between analysis, discourse and interpretation on the one hand, and raw experience on the other, and I ALWAYS choice raw experience."
701,isfp,"I guess that's the Introversion part of us. Being alone, with inanimate objects (I included animals here because they don't expect much from us as humans do) helps us with being ease.   
The second paragraph happens to me as well. I get exhausted for creating self, and have to retire to a lonely spot to recharge"
702,isfp,"Idk i just have a terrible memory with stuff like this. I mean i watch films and i remember how i felt about them and i comprehend them at the time but often i end up forgetting the plot and the names of the characters and other details after a while. When someone asks ""have you seen ___?"" im usually like ""yeah, but i dont remember anything about it"". Im also horrrrrible at catching references. Like, even if ive seen the movie a few times i still wont catch a reference someone makes about it. Like, lines of dialogue in films never stick with me. I have a good memory for things in real life and stuff. I barely ever forget someones name and things like that. But for some reason if its a show or something i just forget everything about it. Is this an isfp thing or am i just slow? Haha"
703,isfp,"Same! And there are some people who always feel the need to make a movie or TV reference whenever they speak about anything at all. These people are incredibly frustrating to communicate with. Especially when I tell them I haven‚Äôt seen it, and they proceed to spend 10 minutes telling me the entire plot in detail, totally derailing the original conversation. "
704,isfp,"I think I'm an ISFP and I have trouble, too. Once I see something again, I'll usually remember what happened, but not the first time usually. Especially something like GoT, I have to watch the recaps to remember anything that happened"
705,isfp,"Yeeaaah ive always found those people kind of obnoxious. It seems like theyre trying hard to show everyone how much they know pop culture. Like okaaaay we get it you remember shit from movies, nice. Could be im salty because i cant remember shit from movies tho xD"
706,isfp,Its unfair! Ive read the harry potter books twice in my life and yet my bf whos read them only once a long long time ago can remember alllll these details from them that i have to struggle to recall. And my mom who reads all the time and has been doing so all her life seems to be able to remember every book shes ever read it seems like. 
707,isfp,"Does anyone else relate? I love and want to be creative but I feel so held back by the fear of criticism, as well as a strive for perfection. I find it hard to fully commit to a project or I will often turn down bigger projects that I don‚Äôt feel ready for, because I can‚Äôt stand the thought of putting my work out there and people criticising it. I know the only way for me to progress and get over it is to practice and persevere, but it‚Äôs become a horrible cycle. How do people do it !?"
708,isfp,"In my opinion, it's great that you are able to define your fears, that's the first step to overcoming them. You don't need to brush it off, that doesn't work in my experience. Don't try to hide it, but overcompensate by facing it, being brave takes a lot of courage, you will be proud of yourself even if you were 'shaking' by the thought of it. Practice having your fear in mind and how much knowledge you'll gain by either failing or succeding, each time you'll learn something new and it will likely inspire your craft and improve your life overall. In conclution, my advice would be: focus on knowlegde and gains, and take fear as a trigger to go forward.
Hope it helps!
Edit: btw, i do relate, i think about my fears everyday, but try to not let them overwhelm me and prefer to just go out there and receive feedback from the real world, not so much from my head."
709,isfp,"Remember it's okay to fail. It's okay if people didn't like it. It doesn't say anything about you.
What matters is if you stayed true to yourself, if what you put out there is exactly what you wanted to portray, if you spent your best hours working on it. Because these are the only things you can control. These are the things that say a lot about you.
It's when you have worked on these, people will maybe come rooting for you. Or not. You can't control people. So why do you care? Take their criticism and learn everything you can out of it, that is under your power.
Here, this might help. https://youtu.be/ivfspJOAtBI"
710,isfp,"Hey, believe me, even I dislike it. I program and part of our regular process is that we review each other's code when we make fixes for bugs. I never want to look like a fool in front of the other developers, so I shy away from more complicated problems that involve more changes. Before the process was more formalized, I avoided requesting code reviews, but the result was that my code was less reliable. What ultimately hurt me more was a published mistake, not a private critical review. And the more you allow yourself to be criticized, chances are the less you'll end up needing criticism in the future, as you improve you'll become better and things will go from being embarrassing mistakes to being nit-picky opinions. 
I think this might be similar for you guys. Just know that people only criticize for one of two reasons:


Hopefully, typically, they just want to see you improve. They're interested in your future well-being and want to see you succeed. Of course no one came out the womb walking, and you had to stumble a few times before you got it right, but man I bet your parents were so happy to see you getting it down. These people don't mean to hurt you. No one started off amazing at what they loved, it required a lot of practice, and no one should shame you for being in the crawling stages. 


Unfortunately, some people are truly insecure themselves. But don't let them drag you down with them. That's their goal. They don't know how to prop themselves up on their own or get people to voluntarily hold them up, so they try to stomp and climb on the defeat of others to make them feel better about their inferior selves. In fact, this applies to insults in general. If anyone ever tries to put you down, just think ""you poor soul, you're hurting enough that you feel the need to take it out on someone else. I'm above this. I will grow and you will not be able to hurt me any longer."" 


Ultimately, it's just a process, a habit, that you get used to the more you do it. It'll start off very painful, but then you'll get over it until it just becomes another normal element of life. What I also found helpful was making friends with people who are open to criticism themselves. They'll ask for your honest thoughts and then react positively to them, making you more comfortable with the idea of asking for their own opinions knowing there's mutual respect between you. "
711,isfp,"Thank you! I know it‚Äôs a lot about building my confidence and trying to not let what other people think bother me. I forgot to mention when it comes to creating something for myself, I have no fears and I welcome criticism but I‚Äôm not consumed by it. It‚Äôs because I can say ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs for me and I like it so there.‚Äù It‚Äôs when I have a project with clients to appease that I feel a sudden feeling of dread. "
712,isfp,Thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to write this to me. I completely agree with being scared of a published mistake. I hadn‚Äôt thought of it that way.  I‚Äôm working on being more positive and open to criticism.
713,isfp,"Before learning I was an isfp, I definitely knew I had a slight interest in art and aesthetic in general. Growing up my mom always got on me for wanting to rearrange entire rooms of the house all the time, and I'd always admired art but didn't really take too much interest in buying or collecting it. After learning I was isfp I've felt a much stronger interest in art and anesthetics. I can't tell if its genuine and I just wasn't nurturing my interests before, or if it's just me trying to conform to my type. Anyone else experience a change in interests after being typed? "
714,isfp,"Yes, it is happening to me right now.
I took several personality tests a few months ago. Turns out I am an ISFP (sometimes called ""the artist""). I didn't understand this result because I never developed any art-related skills. I was more focused on maths/science because I was good at it. But recently, I realized like these subjects are not sparking any interest in me. I am trying to explore new things. I enrolled in dance class and I like it. Also, I want to start playing an instrument and I will start acting classes next month. Maybe I will realize I am really an ISFP."
715,isfp,"Haha this kind of reminds me of the scene from ‚ÄòThe Good Place‚Äô, where as long as they tried to do good for the sake of doing good, they had a chance to get into heaven. But once they were told that they had to do good to get into heaven, all their good deeds became for selfish motivations, and they were now damned.
Sorry, man."
716,isfp,"Well, when I started college I planned on being an engineer because I love creating and tinkering with stuff and I did well in my engineering classes in high school. In college I realized the work load for the course at my school wasnt manageable for me so I switched to an easier major, business CIS. I did that because of my mild interested in computers and it was a much easier major while it still had good pay. When I was young though my true dreams were to become a freelance paleontologist or marine biologist and that's still partially true, I just have a voice in my head telling me those aren't too realistic. "
717,isfp,"Right now my interest in mbti is through the roof such that I'm spending my entire sunday. I haven't eaten lunch or showered/brushed my teeth and it remains doubtful whether I will at all today or in the next few days. I'm in the zone. I'm learning about each type and creating grids in my notebook.. it's almost how I get when I'm working on art, but it's like.. informational art. Is this a typical ISFP experience of learning stuff? But it makes me wonder where learning has its place in the functions? Te inferior?
Full disclosure, I am learning this stuff because I don't want to be blindsided by my trickster Ne ever again, esp with just not bothering to learn and predict other people's intentions. I am motivated to be able to learn to type people and understand how to make them comfortable and avoid ppl with nefarious intentions, my biggest struggle in life being relationships."
718,isfp,"I think you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs normal for ISFP‚Äôs, I do exactly the same thing when I really get into something new and I‚Äôll make entire spreadsheets and constantly talk about it, I‚Äôve even been known to cancel plans to continue working on it, for me it‚Äôs like a sense of satisfaction. "
719,isfp,"Yeah I did the same. Was obsessed with it for over a year. Then I realized my reason for learning it was not really to learn it but rather to use it understand myself better/explain myself. Sounds like you've identified a similar reason helping you improve relationships. 
So yeah I think Te plays a role, especially in the charts you're drawing in your notebook, lol. And our being ok with putting people into 16 boxes. But it's probably mostly Fi feeding the obsession."
720,isfp,"lol well i'm already over it. i did a deep dive and got some gems out of it that i can use but i'm scrapping the rest. i still don't even know if i'm isfp all i know is how to trust my gut when it comes to people. i feel like any ideology you enter, you can suspend your disbelief for a little while to give it a fair go but you've gotta come back to no-ideology otherwise you just create another prison for yourself outside which you can't think. and i feel that about mbti, even giving the functions and interaction styles a chance. no doubt i'll keep revisiting it, but very cautiously, i can't give up what i experientially know for this, in case it is total shit (or useless for my own purposes). some of it is so contradictory and there's so much disagreement among people about the theories, i feel like my gut gives way more resolution and is a much more accurate descriptor of people than this will ever be, at least for my own purposes. it definitely helped to define functions and orientations and i'll definitely consider that as i build my own model of the world.. but i just can't buy this. idk if that's typical isfp either but meh if it's not relevant to me it's not relevant. "
721,isfp,"There was a talk about MBTI on a forum of a quite popular language learning app and a surprising majority of people (60%) were INFP. It is surprising because INFPs account for 4% of population.
I was wondering if some ISFPs share this interest and affinity towards languages."
722,isfp,I definitely am. I think linguistics are fascinating and I love learning about regional dialect differences. I would love to be a polyglot but I currently only speak one language. I'm starting to learn Esperanto. I'm in the last chunk of the duolingo tree right now.
723,isfp,"I'm super into spanish, and I've retained it years after graduating. But I was extra motivated to learn since my grandpa is Colombian. And I used to test as INFP years ago, which might be relevant to your initial statement. "
724,isfp,"I love learning languages. I am fluent in two languages, and I also took two other language classes in high school. I still remember a lot of what I learned, and I intend to use it as best as I can when I get a chance to travel, and I am always open to learning new languages (though it does take a lot of work)"
725,isfp,"I have always loved different languages! I am currently fluent in 3 languages. Also took French in high school for 3 years, but I never used it enough to retain it. I can still remember a lot of the words but not enough to actually say I'm fluent in it."
726,isfp,"Hey, I know this is super ancient, but I'd like to chime in. I'm ISFP and super into language. I speak Mandarin at a fluent level, and German near there. Soon I'm going to start seriously learning Russian. I've also dabbled in a couple of languages such as Italian, Icelandic, Esperanto, and Dutch! "
727,isfp,"May I ask how old are you? I'd like to compare my progress to other people's. 
I feel like I'm dabbling in several languages but mastering none... I would like to know if some ISFPs share this feeling.
I am able to write in French, Spanish, Catalan, and Japanese quasi-perfectly but I stutter and am generally bad when it comes to speaking. I heard speaking fluently is harder than writing well when it comes to foreign languages."
728,isfp,"I can relate to this. I have been learning Japanese for nearly 10 years and I am still intermediate. I can hold conversations but I run into a lot of advanced vocabulary that I can't read. I don't really study languages. I just listen to Japanese songs on YouTube and decipher lyrics, because I'm curious. So I'm learning really slowly, bit by bit :)
Had it not been for my parents speaking French and Spanish, and the country I live in speaking English, I wouldn't have learned those languages on my own. I am the definition of lazy and I'm trying to beat it with a detailed time table that even dictates what time I brush my teeth :l It seems to work, well at least on most of the days."
729,isfp,"I'm 29.
And I'm torn. While it would be fantastic to master a language, I'm interested in so many that it's difficult to settle on one. So I can certainly relate to that feeling. I took a few years of Spanish back in high school but unfortunately did not retain much. I've dabbled a little in the duolingo courses for Spanish, Dutch, Norwegian, French, and Polish. Of those, Dutch seemed to be the one that interested me most.
Honestly, as much as I would love to learn many languages, I find studying language itself more interesting than any language in particular. That might be why I'm drawn to Esperanto."
730,isfp,"People say you can't change types, but I really did go from total INFP to total ISFP, or so I believe. ... I think it was due to a lot of new life experiences, new surroundings, and new people that gradually changed the way I thought about everything. "
731,isfp,"You are more inclined to linguistics then. I think linguists rarely master multiple languages. Yes. Esperanto is fascinating. Being able to read English, French, and Spanish, I can pretty much understand Esperanto with ease, if I add in a bit of thinking. e.g. near = proksima / far = malproksima
Thanks for answering."
732,isfp,"I think I'm going through the same change... My psychiatrist said that S and N are the most unreliable traits, while E and I are the most reliable. And still my mom transitioned from I to E over the course of two decades. So maybe it is possible. For me one day a realization hit me, that living in the moment is more important than living in your dreams. Since then I developed S traits... I think less and observe more. I don't know why this is happening. The two things that changed in my life recently are, 

I started taking antidepressants (Wellbutrin) 
I turned 20. 

Maybe these have something to do with it..."
733,isfp,"Yeah, I've noticed that learning Esperanto also helps me understand a lot of roots from Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages. I love how it's a mashup of a bunch of different languages and simplified.
I really regret not taking a linguistics course in college even though it had nothing to do with my studies. Maybe someday I'll take one at my local community college, if one is offered."
734,isfp,"Holy cow, that's exactly when I changed too! I was about 20 and started taking wellbutrin!
And for me, when I was INFP I just had so many people act like I was crazy for being all whimsical and emotional that I felt like I had to adapt, by becoming more in touch with my surroundings instead of living in my own world that nobody else could understand."
735,isfp,"OMG this is getting spooky. Could it be Wellbutrin turning INFPs into ISFPs? 
This is exactly how I was. 
I know a bit of neuroscience and the ""spacing out"" and ""thoughts branching out infinitely"" are related to either low level of dopamine or low density of dopamine receptors in the brain. This lets more ideas get through the ""thought filter"" in the brain. This can be awesome for creativity but can be troublesome in life.
And we know that those behaviors are characteristic of INFPs.
http://www.psychology24.org/dopamine-creativity-genius-and-madness/
By taking Wellbutrin, dopamine level could have increased in my brain and enhanced my thought filter, blocking seemingly irrelevant ideas. It could have eventually made me focus more on the real world and facts, rather than dreams and possibilities.
To be honest, I enjoy being down-to-earth. Dreams can be fascinating but the real world can be just as fascinating, if you are attentive enough."
736,isfp,"I think you're right! I got the wellbutrin and felt like I had this new personality, all awake and alert and present and to-the-point.  I loved it.  I increased my dosage though, and sometimes I feel like I don't even know myself, like I've lost access to parts of my brain and there are whole dimensions of my thought process that should be there but aren't... so I tried to cut back the wellbutrin, felt my emotional and contemplative side coming back, but also got so anxious and depressed that I couldn't handle it. So I'm back on it. I'll try cutting back one day when life is less stressful, but for now I need it too much. When I was all ""lost in space"" I really couldn't get anything done at work, I couldn't pay attention to anyone, couldn't remember things people said (because I couldn't really even listen). My boss thought I was a moron who couldn't be taught.  The wellbutrin fixed most of that, unless I'm having a really bad day."
737,isfp,"I stupidly tried cold-turkeying Wellbutrin. By the 5th day, I felt more like a barely conscious bag of meat than human. As far as I know, Wellbutrin is not addictive at all, and hopefully there should be no tolerance problem. So I have decided to take it forever should the need arise. I hope you're doing better now!"
738,isfp,"Yeah cold turkey doesn't go well, did you ever get those ""brain zaps""? One time I didn't refill my prescription because I thought maybe I didn't need it anymore, and then after a few days I started having these moments when it felt like... the connection between my eyes and brain was malfunctioning, and everything would freeze for a second.  
But that was a few years ago. This last time I was cutting back from the highest dose to a lower dose, I went more gradually and didn't get the zaps, but I guess it wasn't gradual enough because I was a sad blob.  "
739,isfp,"Multi-coloured. Can't make desisions/change mind. Like to look at both sides of things. Also multi colours make me act like a magpie ""shiiiny"" though that's me. Might not be you. I'm still trying to figure out which mbti I am. Though think I'm more like you guys. "
740,isfp,"the true difference is whether you are primarily pragmatic or affiliative
also, this will definitely clear it up for you: How Do ISFPs Compare To INFPs
I suggest speeding the videos up to 1.25 or 1.5, for time's sake."
741,isfp,"I'm sorry but that's not how this works. The top comment by ThinSliceOfNutLoaf posted a good video from a good channel with lots of informative videos on the cognitive functions. That's actually the channel that helped me figure out I'm an ISFP in one night, after years of being up in the air and narrowing down my type. That being said, it will take some time to fully grasp the functions, but it's worth it!"
742,isfp,"So here is my situation, I have recently started talking to a ISFP female that I have known for a while but we live in two different countries (Canada and US). We knew each other from a camp we both go too. So we both go to camp this year and get to meet each other for the first time in 2 years. After talking to her before hand I started to develop strong feelings for her but when we started talking she got out of a pretty bad relationship before hand. While I was there I couldn't help but tell her my feelings for her, she said she needed more healing time from her old relationship which I completely understand and respect. Fortunately we are still talking but what I'm most afraid about is I think I jumped the gun and could scare her off, and I did tell her I felt like I jumped the gun and I really didn't want to tell her so quickly but I have never felt this way towards a female in my life and I needed to get it off my chest. So all I want is some advice because I don't know if I just made the worst mistake in my life or I shouldn't worry about it.   "
743,isfp,"INTJ, had an ISFP gf for two years. 
Just like us, they need breathing room and additionally, they don't like and, unlike us, don't cope well with pressure. If you think she does feel pressured because of what you said, maybe you can assert that you had/have no intention of entering her personal space, that you respect her need for time, and that she can take as much of it as she deems necessary. 
Even if you are waiting for her to recover for a shot at a relationship, it's better not to give off that impression. From my experience, their pressure-meter is quite sensitive and the threshold low.
But before you do any of that, wait for a few ISFPs to report in, they probably know better."
744,isfp,"ISFP male
It took me almost 2 years to get over my last relationship.  I know that for most of that time I still felt very strongly about her even though the relationship ended on a sour note.  She may think that it's not fair to you because it might seem like she's just using you to get over her last relationship.  She may also not want to have to deal with missing the other person while trying to start a relationship with you.  I know I'd feel shitty about trying to hide the way I feel about another person while trying to develop a similar relationship with someone new.  Really just try to read the vibes she is putting off and keep at a safe distance.
I'd say you just have pretty bad timing lol.  Any other time I'd feel like I hit the jackpot if someone straight up confessed their feelings towards me.  It saves me a whole lot of trouble trying to play it cool until I'm 100% certain that I'm clear to go for it."
745,isfp,"You're sweet to think of keeping her comfortable in the situation. That's the best thing you can do for ISFPs. If you care about her and want to wait for her to feel safe being in another relationship (it may be a while), then just be her friend. Make her laugh and keep things light. I'd save any more serious feelings talks for when she's all healed, but not all hope is lost. 
However-- ISFPs hate hate hate conflict, and our way of rejecting someone is by coming up with an excuse and hoping the fade away technique works. It's totally possible that her reasons for not wanting a relationship are valid and true, but keep your eyes open for signs that she's still interested. Is she texting you first? Does she flirt? Is she making any kind of effort? If not, give her space and let it go."
746,isfp,"Title is a bit misleading so let me clarify: I have this tendency not to tell anyone of my achievements. For example, I didn't tell my friends about my study abroad program until a week before, and that's because they had plans and asked me if I could come with them. It's very likely that if they hadn't asked I wouldn't have said anything and they'd wonder where the heck I was. Does anyone else do this? Is it as ISFP thing or just a me thing? "
747,isfp,"Basically did the exact same thing less than two weeks ago. It was my birthday. I walked in to work, and hadn't mentioned it to anybody. It naturally came up in conversation with my friend somehow, and he felt really betrayed that I didn't let him know.
It led to an awkward conversation where he explained that he thought of us as actual friends, rather than just coworkers and he had expected I'd let him know about stuff like that so we could hang out.
I don't know what it is. To me saying, ""hey guys, it's my birthday."" feels like I'm asking for something, and that feels wrong."
748,isfp,"This is kind of funny because I'm always updating my social media with very trivial stuff. I'd post a picture of something funny I saw on my way to work on snapchat yet I won't tell my closest friends what's going on in my life unless they ask first. 
Being an ISFP is very confusing, lol "
749,isfp,"Or like I'm bragging about something. I know I'd feel really hurt if someone did the same to me but I just can't help but not mention it. It seems pointless, somehow, and I don't want to make a big deal out of it. 
Putting it into words makes me feel so stupid, lol "

‚Äã
https://i.redd.it/79khqk1bfgv21.png

I'm kind of messy, I come home, and want to clean stuff, but the thought of the monumental task of organizing and cleaning stuff is overwhelming and I end up just laying down instead. I will clean some, but never really get things organized and put away.
I went to college and dropped out because it was too hard for my brain to handle, I'd spend every ounce of energy trying to cram stuff into my brain, I once stayed awake for 5 days straight worrying over a test. I just can't handle it, If i see someone do something, I can memorize it instantly and do it myself, but reading about it is useless it doesn't sink in at all.
I also want to get a better job but the idea of uncertainty scares me. I put together a resume and have applied all over the place, but can't seem to get any interviews. I also have some social anxiety of meeting new people whom i might have to work for and somehow please in order to get anywhere. Then the idea that I might do something wrong and lose a job because I didn't understand something scares me.

Does anyone know how to overcome these things... I'm desperate for any advice about how to handle these issues from an ISFP perspective...
TLDR: Cant motivate myself, Find learning in college next to impossible, have social anxiety in the work place.
Edit: I work Security and 3rd shift, live a way outside of town in the countryside (20 miles)
Edit: lots of nice responses and support here, I‚Äôm shocked I got any replies at all really, thank you all for your help, your stories and your support so far. (7:35pm cst 4-30-19)"
756,isfp,"You sound depressed. Depression combined with natural ISFP weaknesses like apathy and fickleness can make you feel completely useless and it turns into a vicious cycle of self-loathing and unproductive behavior.
Engage your Se in a healthy way (physical activity: sports, hiking, swimming, something fun...) and find inspiration from someone or something you love. I once got into a cycle like the one you‚Äôre describing and spontaneously moved across the country, into a situation with no guarantees where I knew almost no one and worked temp jobs, and forced myself to proverbially ‚Äúsink or swim‚Äù. It worked. 
Everything and everyone was exciting and new. I failed in some regards and succeeded in others. Eventually I moved back home with a whole new perspective and I was grateful for what I had and inspired to start living a new kind of lifestyle."
757,isfp,"What jobs are you looking in to? Isfp‚Äôs are great with animals, why not try dog walking? You can make your own hours, be independent, make good money, and you don‚Äôt need a collage degree! Just print some flyers and post them. :)"
758,isfp,"I'm a 48 year old female ISFP and all your points resonated with me.   I do suffer from depression,  but it magically fades when I'm not in a job I hate.  So it's situational.   We have limited energy, detest routine and being boxed in, and are great with anything hands on and artsy also.  I trained recently to become a hairdresser,  but alas, foot and back pain are preventing me from moving forward with my apprentice hours.  I have never been able to figure out what I want to be when I grow up.   I know I can't handle too much stress, I don't give a shit about leading or managing people or status.  I just want to be left alone.  I'm currently unemployed again (yay!  Kitty time and reading!) And considering taking courses to become a grief counselor,  as I have lots of experience with deaths, and deep discussions about feelings are so easy for me.  Plus I would deal with people one on one.  I am a musician on the side, and that makes me so happy, but gigs are hard to come by.   My workaround solution has been to create a hybrid career made up of part time separate passions.  Good luck to you.  I feel your pain.  I just spent 4 hours in the library,  and I feel that I could easily work in that environment."
759,isfp,"Hey. I can relate a little too much üò≥. The other posts are really helpful. I‚Äôll just add some things which worked for me. 
I‚Äôm guessing college/university is a little different in your country than mine but I really adapted the learning material into something that works for me, like diagrams and things. 
I totally agree with getting out and about. For me I began mountain bike riding along with some other things which got me out and in nature etc which really helped me loosen up. Also just getting out and checking out stuff may just help you figure out what you would like to do. 
With talking to potential bosses I think it‚Äôs totally normal to be really anxious. Personally I think of it as a way to figure out whether you would actually want the job. Not sure if this helps. It‚Äôs something that will come with practice and just get a little more confidence in yourself and life in general."
760,isfp,"I relate to this, I went to community college for a few years and dropped out for similar reasons. I just couldn't get information to stay in my head for the most part, I was good at language classes but that's it. Also just left my private security job because its schedule was ruining my physical & mental health. 
It might help to revise your resume, I don't know what yours looks like but I had the same issue, and revising mine helped. Sometimes though it just takes a while to hear back from job applications. 
I agree with adding some physical activity to your routine. I lift weights and find that pretty decent, but I love swimming so I'm going to start doing that too. It can be hard to incorporate into your habits, but if you start one step at a time you'll quickly get used to doing it regularly. 
for the job thing I'm stuck in the same position. I just quit my security job and I'm not sure what's next. I'm thinking about trying to get certified in fire science or graphic design for a good career down the line, but it's really hard for me to decide. Right now I'm thinking fire science with the goal of being a firefighter, pays a lot more than design generally does and would also probably be better if I want to have a family(which I do one day), but at the same time the creative aspects of design are something that I wish I could have in a job. Maybe there's something else I'll end up doing though, I think the best idea is probably just to take the first step towards anything- otherwise you end up doing nothing(which i've done before) and that never turns out well. 
I also feel like my sleep schedule is very hindering right now, it makes it hard to get to the gym when I want to and hard to really do anything other than be up for a few hours because of how tired I am. maybe your situation is similar. I don't know, but I feel that once I'm at a better job I'll have more motivation to do things. Lately have just felt like a husk of a person because of this job, so quitting it will probably be a positive for me. I try to think of it as opening more doors for something better"
761,isfp,"Looking for anything that makes more than I make currently really, that being said, I live out in the countryside, its quite a drive to get into town and back everyday for my current Job (Private security: Which isn't good for my mental health)
Preferably something that isnt too complicated. Working with Animals does sound like it could be something I'm into. I really do like nature."
762,isfp,"I feel like security is appealing to us but ultimately bad for our mental health as Isfps, the conflict and stuff, it definitely takes a toll. I related to that a lot. I want a better job that doesn‚Äôt have as much conflict on a day to day basis."
763,isfp,"mine doesn't have too much conflict, but I work in a good area at night time. I think it's mostly just tiring because of the time, other guards who work there, and poor communication with the client(so the guards never know what's going on there until we arrive). My brother works at a place with more conflict and I can see how it'd be exhausting though, I have only had to talk to a few people at my current place so it's not too bad."
764,isfp,"I love being with people and being invited out to stuff, I‚Äôd always choose going out to staying home alone, but yet I‚Äôm shy to approach people. Crowds aren‚Äôt a problem for some reason, but when I‚Äôm like sitting on the bus for example, or in the waiting room, I can‚Äôt seem strike up a conversation with anyone. They‚Äôre sitting across the room and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúwow geez this is awkward as shit, I really want to talk to them but I can‚Äôt, oh shit they just glanced at me, I need to say something and hope they‚Äôre welcoming.‚Äù I‚Äôm sitting there feeling self conscious, I‚Äôd like to talk to them but I can‚Äôt find a way to do it, and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to be awkward and stuttery about it, I‚Äôm pretty sure this is just basic ass social anxiety but Idk I want your thoughts. Is this common for introverts or am I just fucking myself?"
765,isfp,"You don't strike me as introvert, more extrovert, although I'm not an expert. I'm see myself as pretty introvert and would never dream of starting a conversation with someone I don't know on a bus or in a waiting room. I would prefer people leaving me alone in situations like that, cause I know it's gonna end in awkwardness af. I have a friend that's kind of like you, wanting to talk all the time with everybody because silence makes him uncomfortable. "
766,isfp,"To get it out of the way, being introverted simply implies that being around people, talking and paying attention to them takes away from your energy, instead of making you more energetic, as is the case with extroverts.
I feel like being shy or awkward isn‚Äôt related to being introverted. I believe it has more to do with certain feelings, perceptions or skills that could be worked on.
I‚Äôm gonna write a long annoying response to this because it hit home. Hope I don‚Äôt sound condescending in any way.
Being on the bus is such a small thing at first glance/ or to some people probably. But if you think about it is a bit complicated. You‚Äôre in this tight space with 20 or so strangers, got nothing else to do than observe them or engage them until you get to your B point but you can‚Äôt because...they‚Äôre still strangers even though they‚Äôre right next to you.
Insert quote from favorite book, which i‚Äôm trying really hard not to shove in everyone‚Äôs face:
What I do to try and enjoy my bus rides is this. I think of all the people as my friends. As interesting, complex, busy fellow human beings. I love them for their different qualities and defects and I believe in their kindness and potential. Yet I know that I just won‚Äôt see them for too long because we‚Äôre all just trying to get to a certain place.
By slowly practicing love and compassion with strangers it becomes easier to be among them. Maybe not in public transport, because people are often frustrated, tired, preoccupied etc. But smiling to your waiter, cashier, old lady walking her dog is nice. If you wanna go more into it, we‚Äôre technically not really strangers. We‚Äôre like bees in a beehive, part of an organism.
Bible has a version of that.
Religion aside, it is a pretty nice sentiment.
If this anxious feeling stays with you, It would be useful to talk to anyone close to you about it. Or even in a therapy session. Like going to the doctor‚Äôs for a tummy ache except in this case your soul hurts a bit. If it‚Äôs really anxiety and you have the means to treat it you should try to.
You could be an anxious extrovert or a curios introvert or anything in between.
Much love from a similar human, -infp"
767,isfp,"A few years back, my mentor insisted that I was an extrovert, and I maintained I was an introvert.  Upon doing some reading and talking to people, I realized that she was right. I was probably an extrovert with some pretty severe social anxiety. I have been seeing a therapist for about 18 months (she is fantastic) and as I am breaking down these anxiety walls I am finding myself feeling more and more extroverted. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling.
Reflecting on that, I had always equated not liking attention or being in crowds with introversion. I am finding as I discuss with my truly introverted friends the visible difference is by and large, they would be happy as a hermit with little to no human interaction for extended periods of time. I myself, would get exhausted frazzled around people, but depressed if I go more then a couple of days without seeing people. The frazzled around people is way down (but still present) but the exhaustion around people is mostly gone. Now I feel energized when I spend time with people and still start to slip towards depression on my own for too long. It‚Äôs how I recognized the difference. 
Based what you described above, it sounds like what you are experiencing is quite similar to how I experience social anxiety. Preoccupation with how others see and view me has lead to thousands of encounters like you described above. "
768,isfp,"Hello there :) 
I've been wondering something about my fellow ISFPs. One of the main reasons why I had such a hard time accepting that I was an ISFP, is that they always seem to be described as ""artsy"". I've never really been much of an artist myself in any way. I am the sort who likes to ""stop and smell the roses"" but never had any drive to recreate what I've seen through art. I always felt like I could never do the real world any sort of justice so to speak. Plus I'm just not skilled in that way. 
So how about you? I'm not the only ISFP who isn't ""artsy"" am I?"
769,isfp,"I used to always draw as a kid, and I've always been very good at it, but I wouldn't actually call myself ""artsy."" I only like drawing things exactly like reality and I don't really enjoy art museums. And I don't even make art anymore except when I'm paid to do it at work. But I don't feel that ""artistic drive"" to create and express and whatnot. My teachers in the art program would get frustrated with my lack of creativity. But I definitely have an artistic temperament... I'm moody, I'm fascinated by colors, textures, and materials, and I think things are beautiful that everyone else considers either ugly or mundane. "
770,isfp,"People have called me artsy, but I am in no way an artist. I can only do stick figures and abstract. I think people call me that because I very obviously enjoy art and totally do the ""stop and smell the roses"" thing."
771,isfp,"I think I'm pretty artsy. I like drawing, design, crafts and things. Art always is really inspiring to me and I like being creative.
ISFPs are called artists, but this doesn't have to be in a literal sit down and put emotions into a picture kind of way. Enjoying sights and sensations can be a sort of artsiness. Art, to me, is mostly about aesthetics and personal meaning. If you are into those, you are ""artsy"" in a way :)"
772,isfp,"I've always liked art and drawing as kid but I never really pursued it. Now I'm trying to learn graphic design, however my skills are pretty amateur. I've had the artistic drive but sometimes I'm too lazy. While it's fun to make art, I spend more time to ""stop and smell the roses."""
773,isfp,"I know this is old, but... it's a slow sub, and I just found it out, so I'll reply anyway. I also resisted the idea of being ISFP because I don't feel artsy at all. I love consuming art: music, movies, comics, books, I like museums too although I don't know much about paintings. But I never feel like I should be a creator.
If I'm creating something and it turns out bad, I resent it. THat goes for everything, from cooking to DIY. And if something becomes a chore, I don't want to do it anymore, and you need a lot of practice to become a good artist. So I just settled for being a consumer. I like that 'smell the roses' part, definitely can relate. I just don't feel like expressing myself to people, arts or words, since they'll probably misunderstand."
774,isfp,"I did draw for some years as a hobby, but I don't feel that I'm particularly creative or innovative. I DO have an appreciation for art though, particularly in the visual aspects. Rather than a creator, I view myself as more of a consumer. :) Having a sense of aesthetics is pretty big for me, and I suspect it applies to most other ISFP ""artists"" overall, even if they're not artists in the literal sense."
775,isfp,"I'm a isfp Photographer, I guess that's where my ""artsy"" side comes out. I also enjoy art in general but I'm not very good at it. But I think the main thing is just the way we all sense and feel things. Not necessarily presenting those things to others in a physical form. For example, I think a lot of us can relate to appreciating colors or smells or moments in general. So I'd say it's the appreciation for senses that make us ""artsy"" so to speak, not exactly our level of physical artistic talent."
776,isfp,"For the most part, I am not artistic when it comes to physical media. I have a major music appreciation, though, and would like to work on more projects regarding that. I also used to be really big on writing poetry, and am drawing back on those skills for lyric writing for a musical."
777,isfp,"Yeah that makes sense. I suppose in that way I'm ""artsy"" as well. 
I remember when I was in Rotterdam last October and I was sitting in a park smoking a joint. I was so happy at that moment I didn't want it to end. I enjoyed the colours, the smells, the crisp cool air, etc. I suppose it's moments like those that inspire a lot of ISFPs to do art. "
778,isfp,"No, I appreciate your response. I can honestly say that I agree with you on this 100%. 
For me, it might be a case of just not having enough time or motivation to learn art well enough to be good. Most people whose art blows me away have been practicing for decades probably. Well I've tried (I even took a sketching class) and I resent most of my work, because it looks horrible. I know if I had the patience I could practice every day for the next ten years, and maybe I would make art that I could be proud of, but the motivation isn't there for me to keep at it. 
I would say that, more often than not, when I try to express myself I just end up failing. I seem to confuse everyone, myself included, more so than anything. "
779,isfp,"But don't you think that most people, regardless of type, can appreciate colours, smells, general anesthetic things, etc? It seems like a stretch to me to say that this is what makes ISFPs who they are. "
780,isfp,"It has to do with the way SPs present themselves. They put more energy into their presence because they are always more aware of it due to the Se preference. I'm not saying all SPs are all flashy and artsy-fartsy in appearance, but they just put more attention to it and mold it constantly in their own way. You could call it artistic."
781,isfp,"Yeah, this is it! If I had a drive strong enough to keep at it for years, I'd probably do well, but I don't like anything specific that much. If I can start to understand myself (which is why I'm reading more about psychology), that's enough for now. Thanks for this post :)"
782,isfp,"I believe it's that most of us have a natural affinity for it. It's why it's in our personalities descriptions. Our lives tend to be more focused on how things make us feel than some of the other personality types. Which is the reason so many are artists in a literal sense. I'm not saying others can't appreciate those things just the same, I'm just saying for most isfps that is more engrained in their lives and their personalities than others, and that's what makes the isfp the ""artist"""
783,isfp,"Reasons why I don't like starting conversations first: 


I don't know if you care about this topic at all


I have nothing to contribute to a previous related conversation


I am not knowledgeable about the things you are interested in


Everyone has their own opinion and I don't want to force mine on you


There is no reason for a conversation to happen in this circumstance


However

If you talk to me first and have to make attempts to keep the conversation going, it probably means that I'm attempting to end the conversation and you are annoying.  If I like the conversation we're having, I'll help you keep it going naturally.

edit:

If none of the previous things are true, I'll start the conversation.
"
784,isfp,"I can reassure you now that seasonal depression is definitely a thing. Once winter hits where I am, my mood and mental state can get much worse. You just need to keep in mind that it's only temporary, and it's going to get better come spring/summer. Everyone gets it."
785,isfp,"I prefer sunny, warm, bright days. Days like that makes me want to be productive and just feels good. Rainy days makes me feel nostalgic and laid back. I don't let it bother me too much because I can't change the weather. I just endure it and hope for better days to come. "
786,isfp,"Very. I feel totally dead inside and moody with typical autumn/winter weather/settings around. Grey skies, dead trees, coldness, etc. Blue skies with clouds, sun, warm weather and trees full of leaves make me happy.
I don't really mind rain, though. (Unless I'm outside while it rains)"
787,isfp,"Seasonal depression is an interesting one for me. If you asked me ‚Äúdo you usually feel better or worse in winter?‚Äù Id probably answer worse. Even tho winter means Christmas, which I always adore. But it seems impossible for me to pinpoint my ‚Äúworse‚Äù answer purely down to the seasons, as oppose to down to other things going on in my life. This winter was a pretty difficult one, but other factors certainly played into that. And now it‚Äôs turning to spring, I feel much much better - genuinely good and clear minded. Though there‚Äôs also nothing bringing me down currently so it‚Äôs hard to say.
As for day to day life, definitely. The weather absolutely has a literal and instant impact on my mood. Sun always = happier. "
788,isfp,"Hahaha yeah, I'm not straight forward at all.. I would avoid them for the first little while when I'm crushing hard.. then just try and be around them all the time... like a stalker 
Why would you make the person feel bad by you liking them?"
789,isfp,"Hey guys. So, I've realized lately that I'm really discontent. The over-critical part of me is always going hay-wire. Like...its bad. On top of that, I've been struggling to just ""be."" Now that I type this, I find it weird that I struggle with that since it seems to go with the ISFP, but there it is. I just think of all the things I'm working to gain (degree, family, career) and I want it now. I'm ridiculously impatient with all of this stuff. Its difficult for me to ""go in my head"" and process things because I'm just so filled with criticism and discontentment and my brain gets overwhelmed. Anyone got any advice (other than ""just let it go"" or ""just be patient,"" if I could have i would have). I don't want to be an angry person. I have huge blessings in my life and I count them daily. I just want to be."
790,isfp,"Are you sure about that? I used to really want all those things too, and then I got them. A few years later I started feeling stifled, bored, tempted to cut and run.
Now I'm on edge just like you but for opposite reasons. I want freedom."
791,isfp,"Currently doing better :) Its been kind of a back and forth battle I just need to continue to accept where I am and the blessings therein. So, far its been a bit easier. I'm trying to tap into the whole ""ISFP smell the roses"" thing more and more lol. Thanks a bunch for asking :)"
792,isfp,"I understand, I have struggled so much with Patience in the past and it's funny because everyone tells me I am very patient.I just don't feel it. But it sounds like I am in about the same place in life as you and I promise it will all come and sometimes we need to enjoy the book before we flip to the last page to see what happens. "
793,isfp,"First if all, I've written a few songs and I'm a drummer. That's how I'm artistic in the usual sense. Other than that, I'm also like to create my own style. It doesn't necessarily have to be fashionable in the traditional sense, but it has to feel ""me."" I also like making jokes that nobody's ever heard, if that's artistic at all. I have also synthesized a way of living that is extremely congruent with who I am. From the words I choose, to the way my body moves about the world, to the way I look at someone, I have made these all ways I express my inner most values."
794,isfp,"Drawing, painting, designing. Still lacking technical skill and the practice that many talented people show in their drawings, but it's a relief just to draw and express myself. Any way we express ourselves in makes us artists in my opinion. Anything can be considered art, but not everything is art. It's a very philosophical and subjective discussion."
795,isfp,"I sketch and draw from time to time. Mostly in pencil. I also do solar pyrography, which is the art of burning portraits or pictures into wood using nothing but direct sunlight and magnifying glasses of varying sizes."
796,isfp,I went to school for graphic design & through internships and natural abilities I switched over to be a User Experience Designer. I use my artistic side to solve complex problems in different ways than someone else would.
797,isfp,"I usually write a more classic rock feel, but the guys I play with have different inspirations so I like to meld them together. I'm not like a professional songwriter or anything, just something I do in my spare time. 
As for the figuring me out thing, it was a long process of seeing therapists for depression and anxiety, ADD meds, and just introspecting daily to kind of sort myself out. Now I just live in a way that I know makes me happy, and I wish the same for you and everybody else."
798,isfp,"One of my best friends is an ENTP, and this is pretty damn true. We don't clash often, but when we do we clash hard. I understand every word coming out of his mouth. It all makes perfect fucking sense. Its like. I'm sorry I don't eat all the carrots I make, but they make the plate look more appealing so they have to be there. I understand that its a waste of food, I understand its a waste of money, I understand it makes no sense, but it makes me happy."
799,isfp,"I‚Äôm not impressed with the fact that by God of War lore Kratos defeats this Guy...
That means you‚Äôve killed one of my people...
That means I still don‚Äôt give a shit because it wasn‚Äôt me you killed at the end of the day! üòÅ"
800,isfp,"Sounds about as intimidating as I'd expected. 
Newsflash meme: ""local ENTP thinks he's ESTP"""
801,isfp,"Of course I don't mean ACTUALLY set anything on fire. I mean, when you get upset, does it really blow up in your face? Do you say tons of things you regret? Do you feel like just throwing your hands up in the air and throwing things away?
As an ISFP, I can definitely do this. I am a really sensitive guy, but if I get upset, I feel really hurt, especially when I feel like I've been handled with insensitivity or ignored or something like that. My brother's friends were making some pretty innocent jokes about my love life and I blew up about my girlfriend's rape and just completely buzzkilled the conversation. And now I wish I had kept her secret because she doesn't want it known. It just came out.
I also got unreasonably pissed at the girlfriend for being annoyed at me trying to talk to her while she was reading the news. I get it, people don't like to be interrupted, but she didn't handle the situation that delicately (she rarely does with such things). So I got pissed and ignored her back for a long time, all the while knowing I was being immature and unreasonable, but I couldn't help it.
I just wish I knew how to handle these situations better. Anyone else have the same problem?"
802,isfp,"Absolutely absolutely absolutely!
I don't get upset nearly as often as I used to, but I've long said that anything I say when upset should be ignored because I'm not thinking, didn't mean it the way it came out, said purposely hurtful things, etc. I always regret it.
When I'm upset, I want the world to experience my emotion with me."
803,isfp,"i rarely get upset, although i'm a very sensetive person i always take the time to reflect on my dilema before taking any action. if i feel like getting upset won't solve or improve the problem i simply let it be. 
however i have some triggers that can make me lose control, for example any mention of my father will cause me to go into a sad rage. but i never take it out on other people, instead i hurt myself by punching walls or trees and dont calm down until im washing the blood of my hands.
there are a few times when im in an especially sensetive state when i will take offense to everything, reply with things i instantly regret, get tunnelvisioned on hatered, anoyance or sorrow but as soon as i calm down a little im able to reflect on my feelings and decide if they were really justified or just oversensativity."
804,isfp,"My gf is isfp (I‚Äôm infj, and an artist), but she doesn‚Äôt consider herself an artist at all. She tends to not express her feelings at all, really. Being an infj, I‚Äôm able to pick up on a lot that she doesn‚Äôt express, but I‚Äôd like to hear from other isfp peoples who don‚Äôt consider themselves artists.  
Does the whole concept of being an artist come with too much unwanted pressure?  
Does insecurity/lack of emotional support during childhood cause a disconnect from your emotions?  
Also, I simply like hearing people talk about their inner workings ~"
805,isfp,"Here, I am one, I'm a non-expressive, active and sporty isfp. Should remember that Fi is Introverted Feeling after all, there are feeling tsunamis or storms raging inside me, but letting it out either by rage or expressive ways is my choice. I actually don't feel genuine if I show them out, like they are only valid and meaningful if they stay inside.
I also can't sit still long enough to draw or craft anything, I guess my Se is pretty high. I do sing (pretty well but that is not type related) and learn some instruments sometimes though, but it is just when I'm hanging with friend or when I have nothing to do, I'd prefer going out and doing physical activities anytime.
‚Äã
Does the whole concept of being an artist come with too much unwanted pressure?
Yes, look at other types' labels, none are jobs or majors related, just pure describing their characteristic (ENTJ - Commander; INFP - Healer; ESFP - Entertainer etc... and you get the point). But artist is something pretty jobs and majors heavily related, which makes a lot ISFPs confuse whether they are one if they are not going that way. I was once confused the hell out of it, but seriously, it is just someone whose self and internal feelings are so strong it affects they way they behave or their choices in life (this is where Ne & Se different). I like the Adventurer label, since I have a crazy urge to go explore places with my physical body, or at least, the Aesthete label, I still want to indulge in beautiful things, good music, great smells (I like incenses a lot), good massages/sex etc... Creating them? Not really, I'd rather do things and explore places (a very very Se trait, not necessarily drawing or crafting).
‚Äã
Does insecurity/lack of emotional support during childhood cause a disconnect from your emotions?
I actually experienced that with my childhood, adolescence and even some adult time lol. But no way that disconnect me from my emotions, it actually enhances them and makes me do crazy things, I even thought I have BPD lol. If you are thinking that this is the case of your girlfriend which makes her lose her artistic ability, I don't think it is true, Fi is just purely enjoy what it likes while Se has ton of activities to do. Like I want to lose myself in sports, dancing to the music, and in the water while I'm swimming, I'm still an introvert, so introvert I actually go to the swimming pool as early as possible (around 5:30) just to enjoy alone time under the water, then the crazy and wild crowd enters... sad.
‚Äã
I did some research on this, the NT are actually the ones who favor art/design stuffs the most, follow by NF and ST (yes ST, you will find more ISTP and ESTP artists than ISFP I believe, something related to fine motor skills, SFP are gross motor skilled), even as photographers, ISFP ones are actually near the bottom. A lot of ISFPs lean toward music more than art/design, they are more dynamic to the very least, and I read somewhere that INFJ are the best when it come to Design, I forgot to bookmark all the links, though you can try to research it.
In conclusion, Fi varies (the most I think) and Se has an extremely wide array of activities that one can choose. If being an ISFP = an artist then all ISFPs = artists then I'll gladly be the wild, young and hungry ESFPs lol. Feel free to ask more if you want!
P/S: I did write some short stories when my feelings are too much to handle, they are emotional and pretty good (according to my friends), I don't know if that is artistic or not but that is a once in a long time kind of thing."
806,isfp,"I am an isfp artist. I am a nail artist, decorate cakes, write stories, make candles, etc. I am obsessed with music and know some other isfps that are musicians. 
I know one isfp that is not artistic. He is very self destructive. His ‚Äòoutlet‚Äô is drinking and gambling. Great guy...very loving and caring...but very self destructive. "
807,isfp,"Thank you for the response. I was actually married to a non-artistic isfp for years, she was definitely more of an adventurer too, with baking and camping and gay clubs haha. I seem to be attracted to isfp ladies, but how oh how do I maintain a close relationship without emotional intimacy? The physical intimacy is great - for now. But without the emotional connection, the physical intimacy will fall apart and we‚Äôll be left with just making food together and talking about our projects, which is barely friendship."
808,isfp,"I see, and that is something really hard to get though, well the things I'm saying below this point will be my subjective perspective, it can't represent all ISFPs or relationships, so take it with a grain of salt and see what fits.
‚Äã
Normally, Fi are much easier to impress at younger age, I can hardly find anything better than my relationships back in high school, even if it didn't last. But it is not because of reasons a Si user would give (mostly comparisons between the now and the past), it is more of the impression of a newfound feeling that attach to a person that make me find it beautiful and hard to forget. Hard to understand right? Let's name a new feeling that I have never had 'A', because Fi is so complex it can't be just love, hatred, anger, sadness etc... those are often categorized by Fe more. So a person makes me feel 'A' or somehow 'A' is attached to that person, then that person is heavily and subjectively adorned by my Fi, and thus, I will be impressed that that person is the best. For example: in one of my graduation day back then, it was raining really hard and there was this guy who was soaked by the rain who stood alone watching his classmates having fun at the school yard. The whole image of him and both the sadness and happiness in his eyes is unforgettable to me, and that is the most meaningful graduation day I've ever had because of a new feeling I have while looking at him and everything around, I can't describe that feeling though. It is subjective so other graduation days or those on movies etc... will be nothing to me. I hope you get a vague idea now.
‚Äã
So back to your case, there are many reasons a Fi user doesn't emotionally connect with someone. I was friend with a guy for 8 years straight, we are as close as any friendship, but I know I withheld all my feelings, it was a very surface or skin-deep friendship (ended last year though, good for him). Well in that case I know the reasons why, but in others, I can hardly know. So the only chance for you is to strike at her Fi, or perhaps create a new feeling (like 'A') that create a leak, then her Fi will go out gradually (at least that's what happened to me). It can be extreme romantic moves (my best friend once drove through the storm to be with me because I was sad) or just random things happen at random times (I saw my ex under the sunshine, his beauty and purity mesmerized me up until now, I still love him so much because of that moment despite he has changed dramatically by alcohol and cigarettes).
‚Äã
Feel like I say a lot but still can't help you, Fi is so complex and live in it's own world, I just can't show you a clear way to win it over, it depends and varies so much. Imagine diving under the pool and looking up, things are distorted right? That's Fi, so it is really hard to know what will Fi loves or be affected, not to mention each person are different... 
But Fi are pretty selfish and vain... (hard to admit), so try to praise it. Try to know what she really likes, not surface things like hobbies, gifts etc... things that would make her heart beats crazily, try being romantic? or just be there? or follow and give in completely to her hobby, for the sake of really try to learn her hobbies. I love it when a guy just be there and be attentive to my life, no questions, no opinions, no need for affirmations etc... just sincerely want to be with me.
‚Äã
Seems like I vented a lot lol, just be pure and genuine, love will win. Ah, and try to look her in the eyes to show your love or affection, you might see her Fi that way in some circumstances too haha. Good luck!"
809,isfp,"Are you also a non-artistic ISFP? I often get 4 and 9 for enneagram but 9w8 fits me better, I think it can be related somehow. Like in many ISFPs, both a sense of self and the enjoyment of life exist, I just happen to want to enjoy life more than focus on my inner-self I think."
810,isfp,"Wow, thanks for the insight, I actually understand you clearly on affecting by experience. I definitely feel that I have a very positive affect on my gf, and I mostly can read how she feels without her overtly expressing it. I can also tell that past traumas have caused her to build up thick walls internally. It‚Äôs pretty clear I need to mostly be patient with her if she‚Äôs going to open herself up more to me. It‚Äôs tricky to find that balance of encouraging her without pushing. I have my own trauma causing me to crave emotional intimacy, but I also enjoy a challenge, so maybe this is a good problem to have *"
811,isfp,"Definitely a non-artistic ISFP here. I like my surroundings to look nice, but that‚Äôs about the extent of it. I don‚Äôt have the talent or patience for the stereotypical artistic things. We seem to be exceptions to the rule. "

814,isfp,"My self-esteem changes about as quick as...uhh, well, quick.  One second it's amazing, the next it's non-existent.  I feel like a freaking stereotypical teenage girl half the time. Maybe it stems from the fact that I used to have extremely severe social anxiety that I'm still attempting to recover from.  Maybe it has to the with the fact that I'm always worried about the worst thing happening, or that I've fucked up in some way, even when things are going great.  Maybe it has something do with how I constantly neglect my own feelings to make sure people I care about are happy.  All I know is that it sucks.  I'm just curious if any of you here are similar."
815,isfp,"My self esteem ebbs and flows, I'll have a fantastic week and think I'm the best until I start feeling like I haven't done something (i.e. keep in touch with friends) or I'll make a mistake at work and I'll plummet to my lows. I don't think I have very high highs or very low lows. I'm trying to push past the walls of my low self esteem so that I can do more adventurous things and be confident.  "
816,isfp,"Mine's pretty good 95% of the time. I do some of the same things you talk about (put other people first, constantly worry about worst case scenarios). The thing that separates the 95% from the 5% is that I'm confident that I'm a relatively good, intelligent person. Basically, it's important to know and take pride in your strengths. Sure, I have problems, but as long as I remember who I am, I know what I'm worth. "
817,isfp,"Much like you, one day I feel like hot shit and others I feel like actual shit. I have noticed that whenever my self esteem is low it's usually also when I'm PMSing...so there's that. Recognizing this about myself helps though because when I feel not so great, I correlate it to ""oh, it's just because it's that time"" and then I tell myself to chill. "
818,isfp,"My self-esteem is alright most of the time. It tends to drop when I'm around people other than my close friends and family because I'm really socially awkward and I always think everyone else is cooler/funnier/smarter/better at talking than me. It can also go down from worrying about stuff, like you said. Feeling like I'm inadequate to handle life.
Usually I can talk my own self-esteem up, by reminding myself that I'm a cool, interesting person, that I'm loved, that things are going okay and the things I'm worried about will turn out alright, that my future will be great and I have so much to look forward to. That helps me feel a lot better about myself and life in general."
819,isfp,"My self-esteem had always been generally low. What I find is that when I get discouraged about one aspect of my personality or feel inadequate in one area of my roles or skill sets, it pours over into every other aspect. For example, I'm a music teacher. When I was in college, I would get discouraged and frustrated with my playing ability. So I would feel like a bad musician, which would lead me to be a bad student, which would lead me to be a bad teacher, which means I'd be bad at my job. Which would mean i couldn't support my wife properly, which means I wouldn't be able to properly provide for my future children, Etc. Etc. Crazy  thought processes... Lately things have been a lot better. A lot of this depends on what you place your identity in. If you wrap yourself up so tightly in things it gets difficult with being okay with being not great at them. The more I find my identity in God, the more my anxiety diminishes. I'm not saying that God is a quick fix or trying to proselytize, I just have seen that God has worked through and past my failures and through them, so it helps me to trust that I won't destroy my life if I have a bad practice session. That's not to say that being a Christian is a quick fix to anxiety but understanding my relationship to God has given me God perspective that has done a great deal of help."
820,isfp,"mine is basically all over the place. it's like, possible to feel really good about myself and have confidence. but I can take it really hard when i make a mistake or receive criticism. i find that, for me it's worst when it relates to things that i already know are difficult for me. "
821,isfp,"Yes, I experience it as well. Must be an ISFP thing? I always feel the most myself/the most confident in my hometown, and I also experience different feelings in different places
(I also wonder if Fi/Ni can accurately read people's/places' energies?)"
822,isfp,"Yes i feel it. it makes me feel familiar and cozy. when i am familiar with my surroundings that is the time i get all charming and high energy. 
i feel like i can share and absorb my friends energy at times."
823,isfp,"So, i've been trying to determine my MBTI as accurately as I can based on the theory (the 8 cognitive functions) and I think i've narrowed it down to two types.
Anyway, how can I determine which type I am?
Here's how I am under stress:
the other day I was annoyed how inefficient and half-assed some of co-workers are and how i'm constantly cleaning up after them. Anyway, in the moment, I projected my feelings of annoyance/irritation towards them and later (a day later) realized that I probably should have been more professional in how I handled the situation, but instead, I resorted to snubbing my coworkers and being very, very direct/blunt. I was gonna say I should've been more diplomatic, but they honestly don't deserve that. Idk. Honestly, 95% i'm internally salty/annoyed/irritated. I've just recently realized that I should maybe not consider other people's feelings, but consider not making my feelings their issue, I guess. I realized that while I'm a hard worker, I shouldn't let the inefficiency of my co-workers affect me.
tl;dr
I need to stop making my feelings other people's issue regardless of their work ethic.
As far as more general stuff, feel free to ask...
Thanks in advance!"
824,isfp,"I'm pretty firmly an ISFP.  For me, when I get frustrated or annoyed at work, I really just bottle everything up until the end of the shift and forget about it on my drive home.  Things may make me annoyed but I understand that nobody needs to hear about how hard my job/life can be sometimes.  I know the faces I make and the thoughts I have when people start complaining about their pseudo-problems to each other.  I picture how they would think of me were I to just start complaining about shit to them.  I never want to be ""that guy"" in any possible situation, so I've become very good at avoiding almost all conflicts. That said, if I was being treated like dirt and everyone just expected me to take it, I would certainly blow my lid and let them know how I'm feeling at that very moment.  It's unlikely for me to recognize the past or the possible futures while I'm supremely pissed off.  I won't feel bad about making a scene, though, if I can justify my feelings in the eyes of those around me. 
There are lots of videos on youtube and even the MBTI subreddits' sidebars to help you figure out which one you are most closely related to."
825,isfp,"Hey! You sound A LOT like my ISTP boyfriend. He gets very annoyed at inefficient people who are ""lazy"" and messy. That's literally his only complaint about his co-workers ever.
I'm an IxFP and I would be annoyed at messy, slackers but I rarely get too worked about it. I'm more likely to be upset by someone being mean or rude. 
I'm not sure if that helps you determine your type but even the way you wrote that sounded eerily like my ISTP so. "

It might be a hard pill to swallow at first, but it's amazing how everything, past and present, falls into place once you've removed the rose colored glasses about yourself. "

829,isfp,"It feels right.  
I'm also tripping on it a little because negative stuff in my past that I've never been able to make sense of finally fell into place.  Yesterday was the pinnacle of a rough last few days, but I aired some things, slept on them, and now I'm better."
830,isfp,"I get it, man.  Isfp is a pretty cool mode of being, like the ultimate individualist.  I think that's why, when it was presented to me, I latched onto it so readily.  Questions about self finally answered, gaps finally closed, are more worth it to me, so it definitely comes down to how curious you really are about it (which also says something about your type, incidentally).  "
831,isfp,"So glad you are doing better. I might have to take the test again myself, as I haven't done so in a year. I feel like I have undergone pretty major changes these last 3 months. Wonder if my type changed as well?"
832,isfp,"Thank you :) When I say past, I mean my childhood/teens.  It's always worth looking into if you're uncertain, though.  I didn't want to admit how uncertain I was, I think, or else I wouldn't have gone searching for additional answers in the first place.
If you're so inclined, there's a questionnaire on r/mbtitypeme that'll get you some pretty insightful responses."
833,isfp,"I know this is like r/shittymbti troll question but. ..... yes, yes I do.  ;D
edit: it's not about socks specifically, it's just my room is always a little bit of a disaster, and sometimes it's tough to get to the laundry basket :/"
834,isfp,"like it's not even in their rooms it's like right next to the door or in the living room where they just decide they don't want to be wearing socks anymore at that point in time.
they're sweet and amazing and they shed socks, specifically socks.
how's the move going? xD"
835,isfp,"Mine always end up in the corner on the bottom of the stairs, where I have the intention of taking them back upstairs but I forget.
We finally figured out where we're going to be moving into. The outlook looks good, thanks. :)
edit: also no stairs here"
836,isfp,"This person could be a SO, best friend or family. The winner of last week was [abmafe28] (https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/3ls2yt/the_weekly_thread_21915_what_are_the_5_words_that/cv97mzp) Last weeks wasnt that discussion based as it was mostly a trial but hopefully this week will be better. You guys made a lot of responses so ill keep it going :) "
837,isfp,"I tend to spread out my trust on certain things to certain people. Probably a good reason why I'm a bit of a loner. The person who probably gets the widest area of trust? Probably my roommate, if only for proximity. I have some work to do!"
838,isfp,"My girlfriend, whose seen me have panic attacks, reads my awful unreadable stories, and I tell my thoughts and philosophies to that Im that I'm either too afraid or too modest to tell other people. She's the only one who actually knows me I feel."
839,isfp,"Wow I never win anything lol. I'd like to thank my boring job for forcing me onto this site 50 times a day. 
But I'd have to say my sister because she's been there for me my entire life. It's almost impossible for me to fully trust anyone unless I've known them for a really long time. "
840,isfp,"My friend from high school. We've been friends since Jan 2002. We became much closer after we graduated, but she moved out of state 2 years ago. I'm glad she's happy, but even though I have a bf and family, I feel like my one true confidant- the only one I can really be myself with- is gone. 
We still text a lot and talk on FB, but it's obviously not the same. Anytime I visit her or she comes back to visit, I can't help but wonder ""is this the last time I'm going to see my best friend face-to-face?""
It's really a bummer. All my eggs in one basket I guess, but I don't make close friends very easily. "
841,isfp,Thinking about it... it might have to be my older ESTJ sister! She's a fantastic listener and gives pragmatic advice. She used to be an artist and has a very developed Fi.... She's non-judgmental all the time and has always done her best for me no matter what I was going through. 
842,isfp,"I've been struggling between types recently even though I was sure I'm an INFP for a long time. I relate a lot to Ne but people have told me I'm very good at noticing details in my environment which they don't usually notice. Recently I've notices I'm always looking for use-cases for most abstract programming topics (I work as a software engineer) unless it's been specified beforehand that there is no use case yet and it's only theoretical. I'm always up for discussing weird hypothetical scenarios though, unlike how stereo-typically sensors are portrayed. <-- my major reason I think I'm an INFP - could be wrong tho.
I love going on spontaneous adventures, but I've seen the same in most INFPs I know. My main hobby is photography, so travelling gives me chance to take pictures of so many different landscapes. I'm definitely an introvert, I need massive amounts of alone time after every party/socializing event. I'm not really competitive but sometimes I take stuff up as a challenge from people who said it just as a joke.
Just wanted to see if anyone of you had these doubts as well, and how can I decide which type I am."
843,isfp,"Simple:
If you are primarily in the present, and see yourself as always moving (chronologically) towards the future, you would be ISFP
If you are always in the future or the past, but don't really feel very connected to the present, you're INFP"
844,isfp,"INFP is definitely the most similar type, many people have trouble deciding which they are.
Other types I thought I was before ISFP: 
INFJ. ISFJ.
Though those were what I typed as, and I was new, so I kinda just assumed I was that cause 16 personalities said so. Once I researched and came across ISFP, I instantly knew. Though yes, sometimes I will be like ‚Äúhm.. what if I‚Äôm INFP?‚Äù They‚Äôre just so similar."
845,isfp,"Yeh I thought I was INFP for a while. But I am not a good mediator and I don‚Äôt stress over things too much. I take things one day at a time. My mom is an ESTJ and she worries about things ahead of time, while I‚Äôm just like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll worry about it when the day comes.‚Äù I‚Äôm also not tripping over things that happened in the past. 
I‚Äôm not very good at giving advice, I can be very empathetic and feelsy buuut when it comes to advice.. I usually say ‚Äúhey don‚Äôt worry about that thing, everything will be okay, go treat yourself!‚Äù Yeah... my go-to thing is frozen yogurt with all the toppings."
846,isfp,"I'm pretty sure I am ISFP but I relate with some INFP stuff too. there was something I read or saw earlier today that resonated with me, but I don't remember what it was now. 
I have always typed as ISFP(or ISTJ, but that doesn't seem right to me, I think I might have been feeling very idealistic/dishonest about myself during my test for that), but reading some stuff INFPs post seems to be relatable. though a few things I read on r/INFP aren't at all relatable. seems like they are more emotionally sensitive than I am, or just look at the world in a different way. not sure how to describe it but I get a different vibe from the posts on r/ISFP. seems almost like we are less worried about stuff and more calm."
847,isfp,"I usually don't worry too much about the future, but I feel like I should. I can read a situation well, but if I see it going south, I start panicking. That's why, at my healthiest, I'm in the present and try not think about how it'll play out."
848,isfp,"Thanks a lot, I do remember reading that post when it was originally posted. It was definitely INFP the last time I read it, but now I relate to a lot of ISFP descriptions as well - I'm Carefree, Asking and seems like I match with the Gamma quadrant more. However, I'm a Process type, Judicious and Aristocratic as well - which are more INFP traits. And I can't really reach a conclusion for the others."
849,isfp,"I felt like that about the INFP description at 16p, but I've recently met a few INFPs who display those qualities in a much more obvious way, and I really admire both of them. My reason for doubt is the possibility that I'm typing myself using traits which I want to have rather the ones I actually do."
850,isfp,"Ahhhh i see! Yeah I can understand that. I‚Äôm jealous of INFPs in a lot of ways; just as I‚Äôve heard so many INFPs say they‚Äôre jealous of us! It‚Äôs an interesting thing. 
Your point about us being similar, but INFPs holding the qualities stronger is very true though. I know we may think we‚Äôre in our heads but INFPs are always dreaming. My dad is one, and if you can get him to listen for a second without drifting off? You‚Äôve done well! The ‚Äúin the moment or not‚Äù is really the best way of deciding which you are. But it‚Äôs hard. Idk.
If you‚Äôre really stuck check out some CS Joseph videos. Ik he gets a lot of mixed opinions but he helps a lot with some things. He may even have a video directly on the INFP or ISFP issue, unless I‚Äôm mistaken."
851,isfp,"I like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich, The Number 23, Cabin in the Woods, Donnie Darko, Pimer, and The Fifth Element.
These are all pretty highly rated movies though, so maybe not solely specific for an ISFP. "
852,isfp,"Personally, I loved Equilibrium. The message behind it was more government/politics oriented, but watching it as an ISFP I got a different vibe from it. 
Being an Fi Dominant type is both a gift and a curse and I have trouble controlling it sometimes. Usually it ends up with me suppressing my feelings because they're too strong to deal with or I'm afraid of them.
The message I got from Equilibrium, though, is that it's okay to feel emotions. It reminds me that emotion is what makes us, us. It makes us human. It's good to feel emotions, even overwhelmingly strong ones. Not that you should allow your emotions to control you, but that feeling them in the first place isn't a bad thing.
Aaaannnnndd now I wanna watch it again."
853,isfp,"When I think of good ISFP movies, they should have a good soundtrack, visually stimulating camera work, and emotions everywhere. And always, always quirkiness. 
I've always considered ""Marie Antoinette"" to be a great ISFP movie. The one with Kirsten Dunst. It's not historically accurate but as an ISFP, who cares? It's beautiful!
Also anything by Baz Luhrmann. Ugh. I want to marry his filmmaking. "
854,isfp,"I watched a foreign movie on Netflix called Troubled Water. It's very touching. About a guy who goes to jail for accidentally killing a womans kid. He learns to play the organ in jail and after he gets out, he gets a job at his church. It's great because the organ has never been an instrument i've particularly enjoyed but the way the guy plays it is so soulful and intense.. you can feel the guilt in his playing. You'll like the organ after watching it"
855,isfp,"Actually I feel like art is too subjective for someone to say ""I recommend this movie/song/painting/show/artwork to every single ISFP person in the world ever because they all have the exact same taste and they will all appreciate it"".
But still, Into the Wild appealed to my desire for oneness with nature, adventure, and fuckauthorityness.
Me and You and Everyone We Know was a quirky movie with existential themes that I really liked.
That is why I chose those to recommend to the fellow ISFP seeking something to watch... not that I guarantee you'll like them.
Edit:  I don't know why I felt the need to justify myself like this.  Is that an ISFP thing to do?"
856,isfp,Do that thing you always wanted to do but never got around to. Become really really good at something. Don‚Äôt take other peoples BS but don‚Äôt have a zero tolerance policy either. When you notice that you are unhappy don‚Äôt numb yourself to it. Cry a lot and find what is wrong. Don‚Äôt touch substances if they become your safety blanket.
857,isfp,"Learn to be more open to criticism (I'm having struggles with this myself, even though I know I should take it), express your feelings more readily, work towards your goals and dreams whenever you can."
858,isfp,"Getting to learn who more about who you are is a wonderful, vivid experience so be ready for anything - don't deny or downplay your best traits that might not make sense to you (or others) at the moment. "
859,isfp,"I'm not that into signs, but they can be interesting sometimes. Anyone else out there an aquarius and an ISFP? I happen to be both and have found a lot of similarities between the listed characteristics. 
Any thoughts?"
860,isfp,"I'm an aquarius and an ISFP. I definitely also thought that ISFP was similar to traditional Aquarius characteristics; specifically the spontaneity and rejection of rules. There was a question similar to this posted a while ago, and I was surprised to not see a comment section filled with fellow Aquarius (Aquari?): http://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/1wywgk/kind_of_curious_about_signs/"
861,isfp,"I'm an IxFP, and a Scorpio. I feel like 80% of the Scorpio traits do not apply to me and are also counter to ISFP traits. I don't think the Zodiac holds any water because it is based on dates, but I do think it is a great example of early personality theory. ;)"
862,isfp,"Hi isfp¬¥s im in a relationship with an isfp and im missing so much that my partner gives me some enthusiasm or interest and speaks with me about my feelings. 
is this an isfp thing? when yes what would you recommend me ? 
i really love my partner and want to understand more. "
863,isfp,"In my relationship, I feel awkward taking the initiative to show enthusiasm for my partner and ask about their interests and their feelings, because I am not sure when to be vulnerable with my partner even though it is important (if they don't care, I don't want to be stung for asking).
BUT if my significant other told me that showing interest really makes them happy and brightens their day, I would do it all the time! So I recommend telling your partner that you truly enjoy it when they enthusiastically support you and that you cherish exchanging thoughts and feelings with them. I think the ISFP wants to be emotionally committed and supportive to their partners, but at least I am not always sure how :/ "
864,isfp,"That's my playlist:
https://open.spotify.com/user/22oh6llruwbby57xcdhotmkfy/playlist/6CCHaZ0exmugd7ooUpaRty?si=3JqJ1xGxQoicCuEnLhoEGw
I like it,dunno if you're gonna enjoy it but it doesn't hurt to try"
865,isfp,"Any type can be self centered or narcissistic. I would say ISFPs are more prone to hedonistic tendencies, than narcissistic. 
But just because a person values their own needs/wants and puts them above everyone else's, that doesn't necessarily make them a narcissist. To an extreme degree, yes, that's basically what narcissism is. But caring about yourself and not allowing yourself to only focus on pleasing others to the point of your own detriment isn't anything bad."
866,isfp,"INTPs (the opposite of ISFPs but with the same orientation) also are prone to narcissism. I'm intp, and to me it seems like the cure for narcissism is when people attack your narcissism directly and show where you fail. Like if I thought I had this really smart theory or idea or design or whatever, and someone shows me a better one and explains why my idea sucks, then the narcissism goes away. 
If the idea doesn't get a good attack at it, even after several attempts, then the narcissism stays lol."
867,isfp,"I feel like the self-centeredness can grow and lead to full blown narcissism?  I was just reading about some of the problem areas for ISFPs on personalitypage.com and it seems the ISFP can face problems such as only taking in information that he or she feels will benefit their belief system.  The ISFP should look at things objectively before trying to fit it into their belief system, and not simply discard anything that they don't feel justifies their beliefs.
This is something I think I have been guilty of.  I probably shouldn't have titled this post in a way that implies that ISFPs are narcissistic.. I just think it's something that could erupt if we aren't careful and considerate.  "
868,isfp,"Like others have said, any type can be narcissistic. If we take a definition of narcissism:
inordinate fascination with oneself; excessive self-love; vanity.
I can see where you're going and I know I have been obsessed about myself in the past (It was tied to low self-esteem, feelings of inadequacy and wondering what was wrong with me.. yay depression) but you have to remember that a little narcissism can be healthy. There's nothing wrong about loving and accepting yourself and doing so isn't pathological as long as it's not obsessive and you still care about others.
Really the fact that you're concerned about this and being careful and considerate points to not being narcissistic :)"
869,isfp,"do you act feminine sometimes, a lot of the time, all the time? if someone who didn't know me saw me hang around my friends, they would prob think i was a homosexual. i like to get super close to my guy friends. sometimes i will rest my head on their shoulder or hug them. i also like to send them cute messages and call them ""bb"", ""babe"". 
i'm not homosexual. i repeat, i am not a homosexual. and I don't have anything against homosexuals. can anyone else relate? is this normal behaviour for isfp men, or men in general? i see this type of behaviour in the sad chill community a lot. "
870,isfp,"Can you repeat that one more time, maybe add a ""no homo"" in there too? Just to be safe.
‚Äã
Sometimes. I think it has to do with us being childish and ability to freely to express our emotions. It's a running joke between my good friends that I'm in the deep deep caves of the closet. Even my gay friend's mother jokingly once said I'm gayer than his son... But I'm not homosexual. I repeat, I am not homosexual.
‚Äã
EDIT: No homo."
871,isfp,"also, i would make an educated guess and guess that millennials and Gen Z are the most likely to show this type of behaviour, because the newer generations tend to be more accepting of people, are rebels and aren't very traditional. just mah two cents."
872,isfp,"I'm bisexual. I have a feeling a larger percentage of us are. 
The fact that you had to declare that you have nothing against gay people AND stated ""no homo"" three times suggests to me that you might be bi too? Because you sound exactly like me before I accepted that I was bi, and people who are secure in their sexuality don't tend to speak that way.  It sounds like you're looking for reassurance that it's possible to be straight while presenting as a gay person. It's possible, but rare.  Although so is being 100% straight.
Just something to think about. :)"
873,isfp,I'm bisexual. Most of the time I don't present myself as feminine. Sometimes I get in a mood to experiment with my appearance in a way that could be confusing to a lot of people with more traditional gender ideas. But that's like once a month maybe. 
874,isfp,"Maybe a little bit, I'm definitely very reserved but I think I give off a masculine vibe. I'm not super affectionate with my guy friends but sometimes I do joke around with them. I wouldn't say I'm completely straight, but I'm not attracted to guys enough to say I'm bi either
I also like taking a submissive role with some women, so maybe that has something to do with it "
875,isfp,"Yup. I've always been asked if I'm gay, and in relationships I generally prefer my gf to wear the pants. Once I really open up around people I have a lot of feminine interests and behaviors that I hide most of the time. "
876,isfp,The exact opposite is true for me. I spent far too many years in the closet. Lets just say my parents were not supportive of such things. I adopted the straight persona so well that to this day gay men don't approach me. Unless you look like you need a hug all you're gonna get from me is a handshake or a pat on the back.
877,isfp,"Well, I'm neither a dude nor an isfp, as it happens, but there are loooots of F dudes in the world and the younger ones in particular seem to have trouble expressing their love for each other, due to the ever limiting and inherently damaging societal norms.  If it's what I think it is, it comes out as a lot of over the top, surfacey pseudo-homosexual pretense.  
What you're engaging in is not feminine.  It's healthy philia (Greek for friendship) love."
878,isfp,"My friends normally guess that I am gay, I can be more feminine but I believe I‚Äôm a mix between that and masculine. I am very touchy with my guy friends and tend to have very feminine guy friends which are all straight funnily enough lol. But I choose who I am like this with as I‚Äôve been hurt in the past, and only the guys I trust I will be like this with, "

881,isfp,"hey ! I think it's okay to have your introvert time along with your introverted functions, because it's your mind coping with whatever you are going through. In my opinion if you only get yourself in a loop when you're not okay, just accept the loop ahah 
after you're done processing and understanding your own feelings, you can go to your extroverted funtions again because that's when your ""healthy""/balanced. 
hope it helped !!"
882,isfp,"I don‚Äôt think theres anything wrong with using introverted functions to a point.  But I think there‚Äôs a point where it becomes unhealthy.  To be more specific I‚Äôve been pretty cut off for a while due to some shit going down in my life, and now I tend to go into my head more by default even when I want to be more present with people/or what I‚Äôm doing"
883,isfp,"That's what I'm saying.. You can't be present or active when your inner emotions are not in synch, I mean Introverted Feeling works like that it's processing everything you're experiencing according to your ideas/feelings/beliefs and that takes time. So the only way you can be present again is when you understand what's going on """"inside""... basically you need to be present with yourself first before being with somebody else "
884,isfp,"Or nightmares, if you are an unfortunate one. Can you remember what they were about? My last dream was a sexual one. Might be because I have been abstaining from masturbation. I don't mind these types of dreams at all."
885,isfp,Last night I was hiking with some friends when I realised I was dreaming. I decided to prove it to them by flying down the mountain. Then I walked up to a random chick and hooked up with her. It was pretty cool.
886,isfp,A nightmare. It was a classic staircase chase where you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre running away from but you know something god awful is coming for you. Probably had it because I watched Silent Hill before going to bed. 
887,isfp,"Last night, nightmare. I was running late for work (typical of me lol) and I had to go pick up my sister. As I sped to her place, I turned into a very narrow road where the sides just dropped and it was filled with greenery and old broken down machines and cars. As I continue on, I see a big truck coming from the opposite side and going really fast. I try to back up but my tire gets caught on the side, I lose control and fall slowly. First, the back of my car hits a tree and I'm thinking ""this isn't so bad, I'm not hurt yet and I can't see what's happening"". Then the side smacks into a red car and it shifts my car so that I'm diving nose down. Panic hits and I try to bring my arms up to protect my head as I see the ground coming closer. It all happened really slow. Then it shifts to 3rd person and I see my arms trying to climb out and blood is slowing seeping out. I'm pleading for help and all the while thinking ""I hope I don't get fired. I hope my sister is okay"". I hear footsteps and an ambulance in the background. The sirens changed and I awoke to my alarm, breathing heavy.

890,isfp,"Just wanted to explain how I think being as ISFP effects me and my personality. Maybe some can relate.
I come across shy and quiet to people, but really I just don't like opening up to people I'm not close to. I find it hard to think of what to say, and I sometimes feel too exhausted to even try having a conversation and just accept being quiet. However, if I have the energy and am in a 1 on 1 conversation, I can act very charismatic and extroverted, primarily with cute girls though, not gonna lie.
I'm often observant and always taking in my surroundings. My friends will sometimes wonder why I turn around and look around the room like I'm paranoid sometimes. I just like knowing what's around me, and I get anxious if I don't, like in the dark, or swimming in deep water. Along the lines of being observant, I feel like I'm good at reading people and understanding they're motives.
When researching ISFPs, I found that we are often very in tune with our five senses. Which I've always had a problem with sensory overload since I was little. Textures, sounds, and smells have always been very loud and can overwhelm me sometimes. Not sure if these are connected.
People are often scared by change, I'm the opposite. I can't stand things being monotonous, especially my job. I feel like I need to be doing something different, or an new adventure everyday. I don't like living in the same place for very long, I'd love to just live in a van and sleep in a different town everynight.
I don't plan things out very well. I hate things being scheduled and having to plan what I'm going to do. This makes me feel trapped and colostrophobic. I often do things in the moment, with very little planning.
Another thing I've noticed, people are generally either a leader personality or a follower. I feel like I'm neither. I can't stand being told what to do, for the same reason I hate plans and schecules. But I also don't like taking the lead. I prefer doing things on my own.
Don't really know what I was getting at with all this. I've just been trying to be self aware for the past few months and have learned a lot about myself and why I do things."
891,isfp,"To me, it means a strong sense of self and that's a wonderful thing to walk through life with.  It also means a sometimes overwhelming feeling of not being understood, but it's a pretty fair trade.
It means my ""identity"" is in a constant state of flux, that I'm a dynamic, rather than static, character, and that I'm always learning something about not only myself, but this amazing world.
It means I'm probably not going to fit in anywhere and that rejection will take its toll, and that I'm self defeatingly private.
It means I can spot a manipulator a mile away but I can't convince a loved one it's happening to them.
It means sensual experience is elevated to profundity and it means I make and understand connections I cannot articulate.
It means wonderful relationships with little animals.
It means words often fail me, but music never does.
It means I'm not beholden to any particular path except for my own.
It means that whatever happens, I know I'll be alright."
892,isfp,"Thank you for sharing. I love reading these because they are often so astoundingly relatable. As a person who has always felt so unique and misunderstood, it's kinda funny and humbling to discover MBTI and realize there are countless people just like me."
893,isfp,"After reading http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISFP.html I was brought to tears because every sentence was exactly how I felt. This is when I figured out I wasn't alone in how I felt, so I started posting on this subreddit."
894,isfp,"Lol, I know that can sound kind of douchey... To further expand on that, I mean I can force myself to talk and be outgoing if I have enough incentive, it's just very draining. Also, I feel more comfortable around girls, they just don't seem as judgemental as guys."
895,isfp,"No worries, that quote didn't offend me at all. I also relate to feeling drained when trying to be outgoing. Helps when the people you are around have good energy. When you are around the right people, it's almost as if you don't even have to try to be outgoing. Your energy just naturally changes to match everyone else's energy. I agree with girls being more comfortable to be around as well. Just not the feminists. 
P.S. I found the quote funny and relatable. "
896,isfp,"That's a difficult situation. I know some people with parents like that. The only real option is to get away, but it's totally okay to view it as a long term goal, and do it in baby steps. Like, even just taking 5 minutes longer to get back to them than you normally would. Doing more things without them, not telling them things, etc. Small things add up, and each one gives you a little more control over the situation. 
Good luck..."
897,isfp,"I am not totally sure why, but I do not trust my mother.
What helps me is I do what I want her to do. If I want her to show me, in action, that she loves me? Then I do things for myself that show I love myself. If I wish she would give me guidance, then I take some time to listen to my inner wisdom and practice rational decision-making. 
Let's say you wish your spouse wouldn't describe intimate details or tell falsities to other people. You could try affirming to yourself that you try to be a good person and why it's perfectly acceptable to have insecurities and weaknesses. Let's say your coworker lies about blame in a sticky situation or wants credit when things go well. Try congratulating yourself for your own successes and thinking positively about small failings. If a roommate steals your stuff but you have to live with them for a while (see how ridiculous it is to try and withstand other people's bs lol?) , take the opportunity to be an extra honest samaritan and show respect for the living standards in the home. Focusing on yourself when other people are bugging you can feel like a small relief ... you start to care less about their actions, thus they bother you less.
Still, this isn't the most healthy option and it's not a fix. I agree, the best option is to get away or have respectful conversations about what needs to change for the love/work/living relationship to be sustainable.
Is marriage therapy not an option?"
898,isfp,"Unfortunately I don't have good news for you. My first marriage was the situation you describe, and because my self-esteem had been eroded I morally snapped and started cheating, but then the guilt would eat me alive and I would tell my wife, thus increasing her lying to me. It was horrible. 
I went to therapy, she refused to go. When I knew that I had done all I could and she refused to be flexible I initiated a divorce. It wasn't pretty. But I was emotionally unstable at that time and it was years ago, before I knew who I was. I hope you are much more confident in yourself and can approach your issues in a much more constructive way than I did at the time. I wish you the best."
899,isfp,"For what it's worth my wife now is my ride-or-die. So there is light at the end of the tunnel. If you have to start over, find an INFP, their idealization offsets my awfully gritty world views and helps me to stay happier with life.
Although you may be acting dramatic your feelings are still valid. Pay attention to your gut and let it guide you. The only time I've made a bad decision is when I ignored my instincts.
Best wishes on your journey"
900,isfp,"ENFP dropping by,
I'm in a band with an ISFP (really sweet guy), and he really insists that he doesn't decide what we play and do the decisive things and stuff. But when I try and teach him what to play, correct him whenever he's playing wrong and stuff I can see he dies a bit inside and it hurts me but I can't really let him do his own thing, else he'll just be playing gibberish.
What's the best way to get your gears going? I feel like I'm trapping him alot and it's hindering his progress. "
901,isfp,"You might have a point.. it seems to me he kinda dismisses my questions because he feels like he doesn't have the time to think about it, or he thinks it isn't worth the time, so I normally just roll with it."
902,isfp,"Hello ISFP‚Äôs, 
Fellow ENFJ Here! I was wondering are there any similarities between an ENFJ and ISFP! I don‚Äôt know any ISFP‚Äôs so I was wondering if there was a lot of similarities between the two! Thanks! "
903,isfp,"Well, I don't know any enfjs in real life, so this is conjecture.  
Assuming functions are valid, we both operate on the ni-se axis, which, if I understand it correctly, means we might make one particular observation and with that observation, a depth of understanding about how it might have come to pass and what it means.  Essentially, we're both able to make profound, convincing, potentially eye opening observations.  We'd probably have some pretty intense conversations.  I'm married to an infj, who of course also operates on ni-se, and we get pretty out there... more so because since he's ni dominant, he can really riff off my random ""what if this"" questions.  But I digress.  I think, like your introverted counterpart, our differences are more important and more complementary.  You're able to make sense of and even normalize the things that I feel make me so unrelatable, and maybe I'm able to help you realize your own individualism outside the needs of the many people who are so drawn to you.
Maybe."
904,isfp,"Hi there ENFJ, I'm an ISFP (from Malaysia)! 
My girlfriend of 8 months is an ENFJ, and so-far, she's been the best match for me. She gets a little annoyed with me sometimes cuz I'm a little messy (I like to leave fresh laundry on the couch and use it as a pillow), but she quiets down when I make her fried-chicken üòã
I think that ISFP and ENFJ are very different, in the sense that ISFP are very individualistic, while ENFJ are more community oriented.
The similarities (as mentioned by another commenter) is that we both have the same perception axis Se-Ni. This axis allows us to perceive time as linear and chronological, always starting from now, and moving forward. People of Ne-Si axis do not naturally perceive time this way.
I hope this helps a little or at least serves as an interesting read ü§ó"
905,isfp,"Gotcha! That‚Äôs pretty cool! üòé I feel like I struggle a lot with Introverted Thinking, which helps determine who you are as I absorb tons of emotions! It‚Äôs like one minute happiness, then one minute disaster approaches! It‚Äôs absolutely crazy! Thanks so much for your help!"
906,isfp,"Big difference between INFJ and ENFJ, in my experience. INFJs might be my favorite type, or one of them.
My mom is ENFJ. As a child I admired how nurturing and protective and motivating she was.
As an adult I saw her as manipulative and delusional and tacky.
Most ENFJs I‚Äôve met I tolerate on a superficial level and can even have warmth between us. But when we disagree on values, just...no."
907,isfp,hi everyone! how are you doing? So I‚Äôve always wanted to live on my own and currently I am of age but I do live in a country in which it is not usual at all for you to move out until you‚Äôre 24 which I despise. Honestly it makes me cry just thinking about it also it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like my parents it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve always thrived to be independent and I feel extremely useless and unhappy still having to depend on my parents moreover I go to a uni that is 1:30h away and so I wish I could simply rent a room there but yeah. my question to you guys if you feel or have felt this way too :)
908,isfp,"Oh yeah I felt that until I did that. I miss my family A LOT. I'm alone, ""chasing my dreams"". Guess what, reality is disappointing. You have to sacrifice something in order to gain another. I'm desperate to finish my fucking grade and return to home, jesus. 
Maybe then I can heal my mind and start freelancing or smth. But I won't go so far from my roots again."
909,isfp,"i actually moved out of my parents place when i was sixteen and haven't depended on them for anything since. up until i moved out, my dad raised me to be very independent. i learned from a very early age that i couldn't really count on my family for anything. i've always had this tendency to isolate myself from them. they're very dependent on me despite the fact that a lot of them are INTPs. however, because i don't rely on my family for anything, i end up relying on my romantic partners. in my last relationship, it got to the point where our relationship was borderline abusive because this. "
910,isfp,"I earned a scholarship and moved out 4+ years ago, from South America to Asia; yeah struggle is real but learning to be independent is something worth trying; I see it as learning a new skill, is like learning to play guitar, at first your fingers will hurt maybe even bleed, the sound won't be pretty as expected, but then if you keep pushing, you'll break even and everything will fall in the right place.
I see myself as a very  sensitive and spiritual person, so I try to rely more in my feelings and how I see thinks should fold up; like I knew the first time I went to uni in my country, I needed to changed my environment, otherwise I would end up not being useful, and not being able to develop myself, to live and enjoy life, and express myself. Hope find this useful"
911,isfp,"Moved out at 18, never moved back. Lived overseas for a while. Loved it. People commenting isfp's are notoriously ""dependent"". Disagree in the way that I feel the only dependency I want is with a life long partner to be by my side always.
I love my parents and family to bits, but having to be dependent on them is not on. Only way to remedy is jump into the fog. Its hard. Very hard moving out of home and studying full time. But the life skills you'll gain from doing so are invaluable. Everyone is stronger than they think. "
912,isfp,"No that‚Äôs about right. ISFPs are independent in thought. Very much so, which is why you like to be alone to process your feelings about the world and your place in it.
Other people can be draining and intrusive.
That said, dominant Fi backed by Se teeters dangerously close on the edge of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like doing stuff so I won‚Äôt‚Äù  and fiercely committing oneself to the pursuit of authenticity means not engaging in behavior that seems pointless or fake.
Well guess what? Nobody wants to work and most every job requires a certain amount of bullshitting so unless you‚Äôre a super motivated and productive ISFP who is good at implementing your inferior Te, then it‚Äôs easy to fall into the whole disillusioned slacker mindset.
The women ISFPs I know all wound up being stay at home moms or working toward endeavors that allow them to be themselves (framing departments at art stores or teachers at Montessori schools or assistants in biology labs etc.) and the males I‚Äôve known work in science fields or are starving artists.
Anyway."
913,isfp,"Wow. Holy shit. Your answer is so accurate it scares me.
I like to believe I‚Äôm not a disillusioned slacker but I can definitely see that in me. I‚Äôm trying to start two online businesses to support what I really wanna do so I don‚Äôt starve as an artist. I‚Äôve made progress but I‚Äôm super slow with it (lots of ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù). 
This comment feels like a warning of where I can end up being if I slack even more. 
-Woman ISFP"
914,isfp,"Imo, you're not helping. Most people on /r/mbti and its derrivatives define themselves entirely by their type to the point that our third and four functions are the excuses we need not to go further in life. The true power of Se, when healthy, lies in our willingness. It lies in ""giving our all to make it work"". What we should be telling ourselves, instead of ""oh damn I have Te inf therefore I can't work really hard"" (which is a very convenient interpretation of reality, and therefore the Ni ter bullshit we need to keep being passive) is that we should try harder and harder. We should tell ourselves ""I have to give it my all to make it work"", or else it won't ever work.
Instead of finding excuses, we should remember that we tend to be obstinate in ways and to blame ourselves without even caring to try. Has blaming ourselves awfully ever felt better than trying really hard and failing ? I sure do not think so. Because at least when we go outside, when we work toward our dreams, we DO try. And I can tell you that you won't ever feel better than when you gave your all. When we make mistakes, we learn. In any action lies knoweldge. That's when we progress and when we can actually see the goodness in ourselves. I know it takes time, but in the end, it will make a life that you will leave feeling that you have actually lived.
‚Äã
For anyone reading this, if you feel tired of hating yourself because you're giving yourself excuses every day to not go outside or work harder, there are better sources that will not help you stay in your comfort zone, in your passivity and therefore in your self hatred forever.
‚Äã
mbti-notes.tumblr.com, for example, is a website where advices of all kinds are given to help yourself. What's great about it is that people are not smothered but correctly supported, and that each type is considered equal in opportunity and in possibility of going further. Ofc, that works for any type.
‚Äã
I tend to not go on here anymore because of this, but I am sick of the mindset of this subreddit. I wish people had the dignity to believe in the fact that they can actually help themselves.
PS : btw, your experience of ISFPs does not mean that it is inherent to all of us. If you have time to be judgemental about yourself AND therefore others and to categorize them in ""flaws by default"", please take the time to develop your tolerance. Because you can't have a good Fi if you're that judgemental about yourself."
915,isfp,"I don't really mind it atm tbh. I'm happy here, it's not like I want to desperately live on my own. But at some point I'm gonna have to and it'll probably suck for a while tbh. Also, hug back of course"
916,isfp,"Any ISFPs interested in alternative universe, hidden worlds below our perceptions, or that we could be living in a matrix, wanting to figure out the truth about reality, believing in supernatural powers like chi, telekinesis, seeing auras, lucid dreaming, etc. 
This could be due to Ni tert and make ISFPs interested in these things. 
So what do you think? Is it common in ISFPs or is it an Ni thing? "
917,isfp,"I mean, its hella interesting even talking about anything on the scale of universe, but since it may be impossible to find the truth I dont see a point overly thinking about it or looking up any articles/sources because they are guesses too.
Except lucid dreaming you mentioned, its proven and explained, and makes sense if you think about it"
918,isfp,"Oh yes, I've thought about those things a lot. Astral travel, astral projection, psychic perception, unconsciousness, spiritual realms, etc. although I don't think I can put it into words easily. I think we ISFPs might be people with a very normal front with some bizarre interests underneath."
919,isfp,"I go back and forth on this kind of stuff. Sometimes I feel very inspired and filled with a sense of wonder. Other times, when not well supported I feel like I‚Äôve been scammed.  Like it‚Äôs just fluff or pseudoscience. 
It needs to be supported by real things for me to really be blown away.  I find the real world to be more interesting, so prove it‚Äôs real and I‚Äôm on board.  I want to believe it but I‚Äôm not going to just accept it because it was said."
920,isfp,"It's a big deal to me. I study and practice many occult topics, I've been recording my dreams for many years and have finally gotten a grasp on lucid dreaming. I never really related it to mbti but yeah I bet Ni factors into it"
921,isfp,"If it is possible to find the truth, do you think there is one single truth that defines the whole reality? A truth which is so simple but cannot be made sense of unless you experienced it first hand? 
 (I‚Äôm not talking about religion or god)"
922,isfp,"This is my attitude as well. 
Personally, I like to read about theories to understand different perspectives, but only if they have some form of evidence or likelihood. If I don't see any chance in finding out an answer to something, I'm not too interested."
923,isfp,"Well... we are both introverted P's so we most enjoy being alone together just chilling. Can be lounging around in the same room together reading on different devices and occasionally discussing some interesting detail we come across, or watching a movie together, going for a drive together... all that feels very stimulating and we don't feel the need to be around others or ""go out"". We both hate eating out and would rather get take out and relax at home rather than go out. But that is not overly often because I am an ISFP who has found my artistic outlet: cooking. 
My ""art"" enriches his life. When he was single he hated going shopping and just bought things that we efficient (chicken patties for toaster oven for example). Now that we are married, I learned to make Jamaican food (his culture) to give him that loving connection and feelings you get from food you ate growing up- along with just good cooking and my own recipes in general. I'm also an extroverted sensor, so I enjoy going to the store and running errands for us, and he enjoys that he no longer has to.
He describes himself as a warm computer. He is not very in touch with his emotions. This means when he is hurt or angry- it's extreme. Imagine a overfilled boiling pot of soup that u suddenly have to carry. It's fine as long as u don't have to carry that pot, but if something happens and you have to pick that pot up- look out. I help him work through those emotions, calm down, and see different emotional perspectives. The ironic thing is that although he can get extremely emotional when he is upset, he is much better at anticipating my needs and the kids need than I am. He has extroverted feeling, which makes you think of others feelings/needs. I don't have that at all. So while I'm the do-er of the relationship, he is the director.
We openly describe ourselves as him being the brain and me being the hands.
He helps me be a better parent and make better choices because he is a thinking and a long term planner. He also intellectually stimulates me. Before him I was not a curious person. I would've never come across the idea of mbti for example and discovered this whole understanding of myself. He makes me a better person and a smarter person and a good parent. He even got me in a habit I could not manage life without now... wearing a watch and making notes on the calendar (not just appointments but notes like when to cut the kids toenails, what groceries to get at the store, when to give them a haircut, etc).
And because he hates going around loud extroverted people... he hated the barber shop. I'm pretty handy, so I learned to cut his hair by watching YouTube videos and got so good I now cut out sons hair too. 
Wow this has turned into a lot longer of a post than I anticipated. I'll just sum it up by saying that we don't step on each others toes much and have only had a handful of arguments since we have been married (5 years, and another 1 year dating) and that's not too bad considering we are young people. He is 33 and I'm 25. We grew up poor and come from completely different backgrounds (culturally and ethnically) and have children and have moved cities twice. In all that time, pretty much no arguments. That is how strong the comparability is, that it can survive all that. We have become better people together and more capable of coping with life and fulfill each others needs in life and emotionally. We trust and live each other completely."
924,isfp,"Well honestly I'm not really sure. I don't think feelings are something someone really can control. It's only our reaction to those feelings that we can try to control. Most of the time, changing how we feel about something or someone takes time and calm thinking. Even then, feelings can't always been changed.
For example: I might, in time, be able to forgive someone for saying something offensive to me or for mistreating me in some way because they were not aware that their actions were hurting me.
However, (I'm not going to use me or my family as an example in this one because I'm a little superstitious) say some family were hit by a drunk driver and all but one person in the car was killed. Say the lone survivor never let go of their feelings of hate and anger for the drunk driver- that is completely normal. The only thing that person can control is if the chose to forgive them, hunt them down and kill them, or numbly go on with their life in a state of depression. It's our actions we can try to control, not our feelings. Which is why certain personality types (typical Ps or Fs) would be more susceptible to drug addiction... because we are looking for ways to numb our feelings or control our feelings. But we can't and ultimately it only leads to more issues in our life. Life actually does suck and is depressing, but we are here, so all we can do is try to find meaning and a reason to live and purpose for ourselves. I'm not talking about religion, but something that makes you feel like it's worth it to get out of bed and try your best today."
925,isfp,"It's gotten a lot better with my husband. It started with me calling him out on it and pointing out that we can calmly discuss unpleasant issues without getting too worked up. Also he has high blood pressure, so getting upset and yelling is not good for him. I pointed out that he was being very emotionally immature... INTP hate feeling incompetent at anything, so he started working on it. It helps that me being an ISFP means I'm extremely even tempered and hard to push too far to where I start arguing too. When he gets worked up and yells, I maintain my same calm and steady speaking voice and wait for a break in the yelling before I speak. Seeing me so calm helps him realize he is losing control. That being said, he doesn't blow up very often. It is only when his principles have been violated or clearly laid boundaries have been overstepped. I'm happy that he has this stern side because it completes us as a parental team for our children. I'm a pushover but will sign on to clearly explained examples of why something deserves being upset, but also because I have a very strong F, I can keep it in check and help us be very understanding and forgiving.
He also struggles with depression. Having a stable living environment really helps keep him stable too."
926,isfp,"i'm the same :'(
What would you recommend for me (INTP) to control my emotions?
(I don't really care about self control and how to control anger or tears,  I mean, that would be great to but what I meant was the FEELING part, to control what I FEEL)  "
927,isfp,"I don't have many friends that are women. Mainly because my brain is always on the motive of eventually dating the girl I'm friends with. Like I could see myself being really good friends with a woman but then I wouldn't see a point not to date her. It's to the point where if a woman strait up said to me that she wasn't interested in a relationship, I would simply loose interest and wouldn't be friends with her.
Anyone else have a similar problem?"
928,isfp,"I think the problem might come from the fact that when we get the spark of a crush with someone, we tend to think so fondly and deeply about the person, it gets disappointing when it wears off. In my case, even when I realize friendships are not as deep as I thought they were, I am just so disappointed I tend to draw away. Still though, you should probably just analyze it a little bit. Did you feel like you connected to the person in some ways? What did you like about the person? There is always something to learn from other people. If you focus on their positive traits and the nice moments you lived together, you'll learn how to appreciate people more. Of course that only works if you felt a connexion in the first place."
929,isfp,"While I don't have a lot of close female friends, I don't find it hard to do. Its not much different than having male friends honestly. Sure you can have fun and get along together, but then there is certain traits you dislike about your friends. My best friends like the same games, music, and sports that I like, but they complain a lot, can be self righteous, say dumb shit too often, etc. I wouldn't want to date someone with those traits; I'd still be friends with them though.  "
930,isfp,"I have some female friends and they've mainly come into my life through me first being friends with a guy friend of theirs, and then they've been invited into our friend group. So I'm never the one that invites girls to our group because I never get close enough to them; I never really pursue girls because I don't want to get out of my way to do it. Aside from work I don't use enough time between my friends and alone time to do things that would involve girls. My friends and I spend most of our time doing things just together by ourselves so I should find time to meet new girls. The limited ones I've been exposed up until now have never been girlfriend material so I need to widen my horizons. Anyway, for now I kind of have trouble with that because one of the two girls I hang out with are because of a common friend. I don't think I would hang out with either of the girls if it weren't for our shared friend group. I do like them but not as much as I like the group itself or some in it. But that might just come to change soon. So yes, I have that problem. I think I need to be more open and maybe that can help you too?"
931,isfp,"I recently met this girl on tinder and after talking for about three days, we have a shit ton in common. Turns out she's a INFP. She's been great in convos and she isn't in the slightest a boring person. 
She just recently got out of a taxing relationship and she said that she wasn't looking to start a new relationship right away for a while. She says she would like to just do her own thing for a bit. 
I get very emotional when I'm lonely and especially when other people don't talk to me. I know she doesn't hate me, but my conscience says she does because that's just how my brain assumes when people don't talk to me. Its probably because I don't know her that well. I guess I just expect too much from people that I meet. 
Anyone else have these problems?"
932,isfp,"Your emotional stability will never be truly validated from another person. So even if the other person was cool with doing needed to feel better, it would never be enough or it would be fleeting. I'd focus on being content with yourself and only getting to know people you feel you can trust. Don't develop strong feelings for someone before you really know who the person is, because it's easy for us isfps to idealize whenever we have feelings that could someday lead to love. We love love. "
933,isfp,I've been with my boyfriend for two years and I still have to ask him everyday if he still loves me. I feel like us ISFPs can be draining at times for other people because we do have emotional needs. Just try not to take it personally and give her some time. 
934,isfp,"For a while I was like you, feeling ""empty"" without a relationship. But it's something that you can turn around. I've been single going on 3 years now and in that time I've learned that it's not only possible to be happy without a relationship, but it's fantastic."
935,isfp,"I saw they have weekly ""What's on your mind?"" threads over in /r/INFP so I just thought I'd steal their idea and use it here. ^sorry
Sooooo go ahead and spill your guts here if you want. It's open season on whatever you're thinking about.
I'm just chillin', listening to some vaporwave, texting my best friend to talk about crazy/weird stuff. Typical Sunday night. Probably gonna hit up Netflix later and watch Family Guy or something. I think I need more chapstick soon. It's a vicious cycle, once you start using it you can't stop or else your lips feel weird and sticky, or they just go back to being super chapped. But it's worth it because now I have super soft and irresistible lips."
936,isfp,"Well, I'm currently thinking about how jaw-dropping this song is. 
Also, I'm feeling really excited to go watch Frozen in theaters for the second time this weekend, while wondering how I'm going to cope with working all evening Saturday and Sunday, just to go back to school on Monday and work some more."
937,isfp,"I've got a group presentation and a personal essay due in 10 hours that I haven't yet started on because video games & anime, doing laundry & walking the dogs are much more interesting. I'll probably end up completing it 20 minutes before deadline with it being average+ when it could have been great+."
938,isfp,"Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company 
Anyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. 
(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. 
(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. 
(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. 
(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.
What are your thoughts on this?"
939,isfp,"INFP here with my opinion...
Yes, for ISFPs and INFPs alike, we lead with a cognitive process called introverted feeling, and an important part of us is an awareness of everything we do coming from a sincere and authentic place inside. It makes us sensitive to two things in particular that you are discussing:
Emotionally charged situations - we understand all of the nuances of emotions so we can get drained from processing all of the feelings that take place in others during arguments.
Superficial interactions - since we tend to, or at least prefer to, act only in ways that reflects what is going on inside of us, we can have internal red flags that go off when we see people interacting in ways that don't seem authentic. It's my opinion this ""superficial interaction"" is a necessary part of functioning society and a requirement for other types, but for people who lead with introverted feeling like INFPs and ISFP, this leads to exhaustion because we tend to process emotional exchanges between people more in-depth than your typical person prefers to by default. So when we're in situations where everyone is in a room sharing a laugh, it may take a while for us to catch up with what's going on since we are taking a bit more time to process all of the emotions that are flying about the room.
To answer your question, I believe the answer is yes. You're being yourself and that's a good thing. Just make sure that you mentally separate yourself from your environment and to respect and give yourself what you need in these situations while also giving respect to others."
940,isfp,"From what I can tell, introverted feeling types tend to figure out things about themselves by putting 100% of themselves into whatever they do so they can embody a full experience. On the surface it looks like these types are fickle and changing their minds/who they are all of the time, but there is an underlying current of self beneath all of the externals that is trying to be fished out through it all.
It's almost like how a kid who loves legends of King Arthur will start picking up branches in the backyard and pretend to joust with the trees to learn more about what it's like to be a Knight of the Round Table instead of just reading about it."
941,isfp,"In the stereotypical ""this type is the ideal for X career"" sense, I believe ISFPs can have an incredible knack for using the sense world for artistic and emotional expression. 
But no matter what your type, skills are skills and can be developed/practiced to certain levels, and I also have the opinion that any type could do any particular kind of work with a level of competency. But does that mean that I wouldn't recommend certain types to stay away from certain kinds of work? No, because I think there are a lot of motivations involved in particular tasks that can make a work environment sustainable for one kind of person and an absolute drain to another."
942,isfp,"I've taken the 16personalities type test multiple times (and one or two other free tests) and they all say I'm an isfp. I do identidy with some of the isfp stereotypes, but I tend to score pretty 50/50 on all my traits. Can any of you help me figure this out?"
943,isfp,The stereotypes can be hit or miss for a lot of people. I think it's bet to focus on the cognitive functions. I would suggest you take the typeinmind test. While the test is simple and short it also features descriptions of how the functions affect each type.
944,isfp,"Hello, ISFPs, I'm an INTP. Me and another person were talking about how a lot of INTPs experience this, and which other personality types are more prone to experiencing it. I decided I'm going to go around all of the different reddits and ask. If you don't know what imposter syndrome is, basically it means you don't feel worthy of your successes, and you find it hard to be proud of achievements or accept compliments. You feel like a fraud, and that you got lucky to achieve what you have. You can Google it if you want to know more."
945,isfp,"Interesting. I believe everyone, to a degree, struggles with insecurities regarding their competence at times, I'm no exception. I would not say that I have Imposter Syndrome. While I can imagine that this syndrome may become more apparent with the more accolades one receives, I would not be surprised if many people of ""low achievement"" could list themselves among the sufferers. It comes down to a basic insecurity being negatively reinforced over time, it's genesis not necessarily lying in trauma. Trauma commonly does however precipitate mental states that frequently employ self depreciation. Regarding myself, I typically can take a personal accomplishment, ascribe to it a simple take on cause and effect and be pleased. Of course there are more variables, especially if the accomplishment has lasting benefits and affects the status quo in your environment. Regarding type, as an ISFP I am inclined to introspective thought but it pertains more to perceived feeling tones and social interactions. When I find I am experiencing negative thought processes during my introspective tendencies, it is not typically focused towards status -perceived or actual- but on the emotional impact of singular negative experiences. This is most likely due to our relationship with Ne. ISFPs may be able to predict future events more frequently as they mature, but seldom do we plan for or theorize over future possibilities. Hope this helps!"
946,isfp,"sometimes yes, usually just in regard to compliments. but I am pretty good about just saying thanks/not doubting the compliment out loud. 
sometimes i have no idea why someone would find me attractive or whatever and other times I am full of myself, just varies for some reason"
947,isfp,Yes definitely. I think most people do. I once met a few people who were highly successful in top positions and started talking about leadership and stuff. To my surprise the most common struggle to them and reaching where they are now was feeling like a fraud. They all still said they feel like they don‚Äôt deserve their success or position regularly.
948,isfp,Omg this is soooo meee. Yet that‚Äôs not me in the pic loooool. But yeah I went out that one time and I was like ‚Äúoh noooo I shouldn‚Äôt have gone outtt lol  ‚Äú and then I stayed out a bit longer and then eventually went home and it was just as lame üòÇ soooo relatable like omg are you me??? hahaha duuuude this is too funny ü§£
949,isfp,"Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.

950,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and it is literally impossible for me to think ahead.  All of my actions and endeavors are spur of the moment.  I try to plan ahead for important things, like saving money and having a stock of money to fall back on should something happen.  But I always fail and find myself in old habits.  This applies to all things.  For instance, the furthest in advance that I plan a vacation is 2 weeks ahead, but far more often than not I just randomly decide I want to go to the beach or somewhere and I do just that (luckily my work is pretty lenient about personal leave).  I step back and look at all my responsibilities (I have my own house and I support my wife) and I'm like damn, I should take things more seriously, but I just can't make it click.  I never think ahead.  If I'm not focused in the now, I'm lost in nostalgia reminiscing on my past memories, wishing I could go back in time.  But anywho, enough rambling.  Is all this I just described normal for an ISFP?"
951,isfp,"These are all characteristic of an ISFP, but easily remedied as well
Remedy #1- Start a budget. I know it sounds redundant and frivolous, but it's actually hugely helpful. By setting aside a portion of your income at the beginning of each month, you may feel   more free to take on less important expenses.
Remedy #2- You, as an ISFP, are largely driven not only by your emotions, but the actions your emotions may incite in others. Take a step to fully realize the emotional and physical toll your unplanned spending may have on those you love, and then you may have an easier time adjusting to a budget with that newfound intrinsic motivation.
INTP here."
952,isfp,"I think it is a characteristic but you see it as a bad thing, there is a LOT of people that can't live the present moment and are always thinking ahead. You can learn to plan though.
For example, when i go out i use ALL the money i got on drinks and stuff, now i only go out with what i want to expend coz i know otherwise i'll get broke"
953,isfp,"I believe it is. And yet somehow for as much as I live in the now...I dislike spontaneity. But I think that's more because I don't like things sprung on me when I'm not prepared.
But I also don't line committing for things too far in advance. I don't plan ahead too much either.
Sorry, my brain is mush right now, but to sum this up, yes, that's an ISFP thing."
954,isfp,"I flip between one and the other. Sometimes I can't focus on the present, sometimes I'm only in the present. It's weird. It's nice you can stay in the present all the time though, I wish I had that consistency."
955,isfp,"I don't see it as completely bad, but it is a double-edged sword.  Still, you're right, being able to be in the moment is a good thing.  I guess I'm just so used to it that I don't know any different, so it doesn't seem like anything special to me, but it is!"
956,isfp,"I dislike spontaneity when it is imposed on me, but obviously I'm cool with it if it's something I come up with.  I get what you mean about committing to far in the future things, like I remember when one of my friends invited me to his wedding and I asked when it was, and the date he said was a year and a half in advance.  I was like uh, I can't even plan for myself that far ahead, so I'll let you know a month before the wedding.  Kind of bad on my part I guess lol."
957,isfp,"Hey brutha, just don't take rejection too seriously. Im much of a pussy myself too and I know its hard, but thats just who we are. We just gotta fight our fears. We gotta beat it one by one and eventually itll be easier. Practice makes perfect, ya know? Get rejected instead of missing your chance. Youll regret missing your chances more. Good luck to you brutha"
958,isfp,"For me, what's helped me a lot is realizing all girls, regardless of attractiveness, are just humans. Any female you idealize/fantasize have a bunch of cons and negatives to them you can't see. Just because they've made their face and hair, put their best cute self in public, doesn't mean they are the right girl for you. There's lots of crazy, boring, incompatible girls out there. The more girls you talk to, you will become more selective and relax when you approach girls. "
959,isfp,"I'm really passive and usually just wait for them to show some interest in me before I ask them out or whatever. I'm not hugely successful since most women won't approach men, but that's just how it is. Sometimes i'm a little more proactive and will go up and talk to them first, but that can be hard depending on what setting you're in
The girl I like now has talked to me a little bit, next time I see her I'll probably just ask her a question about something and see how it goes from there. 
I definitely agree with the poster below - just think of them as regular people, because that's what they are. "
960,isfp,"Like you always need an altruistic goal in life? You feel that unless you are working for a bigger cause, your work and life is of no use. You are always sticking up for the underdog in any situation, and the first thing you do when you see a new event, is to judge it by your moral yardstick. You always end up making underdog friends and are intentionally a bully to the bullies."
961,isfp,"I have always been drawn to working with people with disabilities and I can identify with this. Every time I have thought of leaving my career in special education, I‚Äôve been drawn to other jobs involving helping people who are disadvantaged. "
962,isfp,"I'm the opposite, I find people who think their worth is decided by how selfless and helpful they are rather annoying. Can't hate them, though, since in person they're pretty nice. Their thought process just pisses me off."
963,isfp,"I do. I joined the Police and have even been injured on duty several times resulting in a broken ankle.. dislocated arms etc. But i cant help but step in and ""rescue"" people. Even to my own financial loss with friends. I beat myself up mentally for the people i feel ive let down and torture myself for the people that paid the ultimate price (not colleagues but the public)... theres not a day goes by i dont think about them."
964,isfp,"Writing music, hiking deep in the wilderness, reading quietly by a window,  meeting someone I connect with deeply (rare),  discovering new artists or people of interest that I can go down the rabbit hole on"
965,isfp,"Music in general, going to rock concerts, getting really invested in an RPG's main story line, drinking a couple of beers with some good people whilst having deep conversations, watching the sunset on a snowy day"
966,isfp,"1) why should I prove myself to you?
2) I don't have much else to say
An ESTP was giving me this advice a few months ago and it stuck. I would like to improve but I'm not making much progress. In fact I've probably regressed.
Do you people have similar problems?
EDIT: added more context"
967,isfp,"I would say I have this problem. I never know what to say so sometimes I will find something in my environment to comment on and tell a story that relates to it or ask a question that relates. Sometimes I find puns or play with words or make I jokes if I feel like I have to say something. Meaningless conversations are rather draining though. 
I‚Äôve noticed that sometimes some of the things more extroverted people say isn‚Äôt really important. Like I could live a long and happy life without ever knowing that they are getting their hair done or that they went to the bank and forgot something at home and had to go back to bank after driving home. I find it hard to just say things that don‚Äôt really have a purpose. Conversations for me are only stimulating when there is an intellectual exchange between perspectives about experiences or ideas or opinions or emotions. If I‚Äôm confortable with the person, conversation always flows naturally though and it can just be about random things. "
968,isfp,"""would be cool is you talked more"" is very vague. Do they want small talk? Or do they want a plethora of detailed and deep conversations from the depths of your mind? I would prefer the later. If they are your friends then they should understand that our personality type really doesn't like to start small talk. The only exception really is when we are curious about others and ask them engaging questions that are just above ""small talk"" but not as stupid as anything involving weather. 
Understand that if you aren't interested in talking to your friends (or the people you hang out with) about topics that interest you, then you either need to start conversations yourself out of your own curiosity or just listen to others pov's and share insight. 
I had this problem a lot in highschool and therefore I didn't make many friends. I had one true friend that I connected with and that was it. Fast forward three years and I have a beautiful gf that's a INFP and I don't hesitate to tell her everything and we both are equally engaged in pretty much every conversation we have. 
The harsh reality about being a ISFP is that you really only can have two or three true friends while everyone else typically stays off your radar. The key is not making enemies out of anyone, at all. Do yourself a favor and let this stick instead of some vague comment about your lack of conversation.
Hope this helps!"
969,isfp,"I guess they probably find you interesting but are unsure how to connect? Generally when people say something like ""you should smile/talk/to out more"" my reaction is to say ""you should talk less maybe instead?"" 
I spent awhile when I was younger trying too hard to be outgoing and extroverted and it didn't do me any good. I would suggest saving yourself the trouble and doing what you feel comfortable with."
970,isfp,"Are they afraid of silence? Do they just want white noise so that they don't have to think? You could recite jabberwocky like poetry, or even better play a recording of it while you wear ear plugs. That way you don't have to hear it and you don't get your vocal cords too tired. I know my vocal cords get tired really easily.
Also you could try meta-talking, treating the situation like an anthropological experiment. Talking about how other people are talking or about the social dynamic, asking leading (experimental) questions aimed at getting unusual responses."
971,isfp,"I'm an INFP  (also introverted feeling)
1) Talk only if you want to = talk rarely, make few friends
2) Talk all the time = probably super draining and against your values of authenticity, if you don't want to
3) Talk only if you want to, but if you like the person try to talk a bit more and be more open with yourself and don't be so judgmental of what you're saying because the shit most people say, even smart people, is very stupid or at least not very well informed."
972,isfp,"the thing is, for extraverts, they enjoy talking, so talking IS the purpose.
for introverts, talking uses up more energy than Starkiller Base, so we have to be really into a topic to talk about it, and even then, we are exhausted completely afterwards.  I've had 3-5 hour long debate sessions with friends and then just went home with a raging headache.  (INFP)"
973,isfp,Either. It came from a welder if that helps any lol. He was real and I appreciated our mutual understanding but he could be an asshole. Basically we were at a party and he said I was cool but if I contributed to the conversation more i would be more like able or something
974,isfp,"I've been thinking about this so much lately, as I've just moved back in with my parents after living alone for a good six months. 
The first thing that annoys the hell out of me is that my mom talks just for the sake of hearing her own voice, and she's super emotionally touchy (even though she'd never admit it) so I am constantly making up other reasons to isolate myself in my room, etc. 
THE OTHER THING is that (and this has been a lifelong struggle) that my mom is always just listing off friends and acquaintances that I could spend time with. While I know she means well, it drives me up the wall and she has no idea why because if she's craving social interaction, she'll just latch onto anyone who's willing. It makes no sense to her that I need a specific social dynamic depending on my mood. For instance, last night I wanted to hang out with ""Sally,"" who's by no means my best friend, but who I knew would satisfy my needs in that moment. When Sally texted back saying she was out of town my mom suggested someone else. When I tried to explain why I don't like doing that, she got super confused and I just dropped the subject.
This comment just reminded me of that because while I like being with people because of who they are (due to my Fi), my mom likes being with people for the sake of being with people (Fe). "
975,isfp,"She puts up with my quiet moods and sitting for hours working on stuff that Im creating. She keeps me from procrastinating and starving. And she loves me! Theres more to it than that, but im married and wanted to say so."
976,isfp,"Just copy and past this. feel free to respond whatever you want:

If you have a SO, what's him/her type?: 
do you have a clear goal?: 
do you really think that personality theories are valid?:
what's your worst weakness?:
do you like to draw?: 
anything that you like to share?: "
977,isfp,"My Enneagram: 9w1
Mom's type: enfp
Dad's type: isfp
Least favorite type: estj and entj and entp tbh.
SO's type: intj
Goal: I don't really have a main life's goal but right now I'd like to find some kind of full time job and then move out of my parents house before i become embarrassingly old to be living with my parents.
Are personality tests valid?: I think kinda? I used to be really into mbti and totally buy into it 100%. But at this point idk. People are so deeply different and layered. And there's so many different ways we're all different. And then there's so many different ways to perceive and to be perceived. With all that Idk how realistic it really is to think you can know people so well and have them categorized with such certainty. All That being said I still think it's fun to speculate about and bond over. I still like it It's just not something I take so seriously anymore.
My worst weakness:
Communication and teamwork
Do I like to draw: YES! I majored in illustration in college. Recently getting back into drawing again and I couldn't be happier.
Anything to share? Nah"
978,isfp,"I don't know. I saw a couple of isfps questioning its usefulness. as you said, MBTI doesn't dictate behavior. "
979,isfp,"Okay, I know I'm posting twice in three hours, but ay, why not. 
I think the blue thing is nice and all, but it doesn't really seem that ISFP, or particularly interesting. I have no idea how or who would actually go about implementing the banner, but I saw when the ESFP sub was choosing a banner they used this moodboard site. So I'm making a moodboard where anyone can go share pictures or whatever that they think would be a good banner. If you can't edit ""ISFP"" or something on to it, that's fine, just upload the image and someone else can, maybe. 
If you're not submitting a final copy then full images are fine, or cropped to a banner size. I've seen 1920x150 recommended, but it's not necessary.
I hope this actually goes somewhere! Here's the link.
EDIT: in case anyone was wondering, to add a picture you click the blue ""Edit Moodboard"" button on the top left. It will tell you from there to add a file from your device or copy one in."
980,isfp,Sometimes I feel as though I can't speak English and often get tongue-tied when I'm trying to explain something.  Is this a cognitive issue or something related to our personality type? It seems to be a recent thing as I am now interacting with more people at my job. 
981,isfp,"Same here. Give me a million years to write something out, anything really, a text or a paper or a reddit comment, and I can usually think of how I want to say things in a way that actually makes sense. But put me under the time limit of speaking aloud without awkward thinking pauses, and suddenly I forget half the words in my vocabulary."
982,isfp,I'm the same way but I've always thought it was more of a cognitive thing. I get all twisted and forget words when I'm under any sort of pressure. I turn dyslexic. It's awful. I can't do public speaking. 
983,isfp,"I have no idea if it's a personality type thing, but yes, absolutely. It may be a driving force in why I'm quiet and reserved much of the time. On paper I can usually express myself alright enough, because I'm able to think and reword things as I see fit. But there are still times that I word things awkwardly and can't figure out how to express my idea better. It often leads to me rambling and saying the same thing five times worded differently. Sometimes I wish I could just open up my head and transmit the idea or sentiment I'm thinking of without using words."
984,isfp,"I can definitely relate lol When I'm typing something, I sound like a coherent human adult, or I just send pictures of what I'm talking about/feeling. BUT when I try to express myself verbally - I often sound like a complete idiot -.- I don't know if it's because I get nervous or something, but when I'm talking (not all the time, but enough for it to be noticeable to me) it's like the OP said, it's almost like I forget English...and it's probably particularly annoying to my ENTP bf - so props to him for putting up with me for 15 years haha I do a lot of ""Ugh why didn't I say that, or Ugh why did I say it that way"" I also have Social Anxiety Disorder- so not sure if it's a personality type thing, or a anxious/nervous thing tbh probably both lol"
985,isfp,"I used to talk pretty well, just not about my feelings. Now I started stuttering and messing up words, and I swear I've never been happier/calmer. I honestly can't figure it out. 
I always hated talking on the phone, though."
986,isfp,"Most of the time, yes. 
The only way I can really know what I really think or feel is talking about it. It doesn't matter if its speech, text or just a dialogue in my head, I need to rant about it for a good time, lay all my thoughts down in a table and link them, like a jigsaw puzzle."
987,isfp,I dont really text anyone and when someone texts me i take forever to answer because i just dont really ever want to text. I have few friends and it doesnt really bother me. I have one friend who messages me on messenger some what often but thats about it. I talk to my bf on the phone most nights but we dont really text much. Anyone else not good at keeping in contact with people? do i just barely need social contact or what? 
988,isfp,"I hate texting, I will often just look at the texts I receive and my brain just doesn‚Äôt want to put the effort into responding. And I end up feeling really bad and eventually respond but there‚Äôs definitely a block there. "
989,isfp,"I used to be a ""have-the-last-word"" type. Nowadays, people irritate me to the point where I don't even respond anymore. Even my best friend or my SO rarely get a quick response anymore. I feel like I'm just getting older and have less fucks to give. Never really thought of it as a personality thing but now that you mention it, I might have to look into that a little further. "
990,isfp,"I don‚Äôt really text that much, and if I do ‚Äî I‚Äôm not the one who messaged you first. Of course, I‚Äôll do it if we‚Äôre meeting up someplace or something like that but I‚Äôm not one to really do it for the pure fun of it.
I realized I prefer just talking in person, probably because I can express myself the best that way. 
So basically, no matter how much I like you, don‚Äôt expect to get a text from me anytime soon, lol.
Oh and also ‚Äî I can relate with the feeling like you suck at keeping in contact. And honestly, that makes me feel like I‚Äôm being a bad friend sometimes. But at the same time it‚Äôs like, I‚Äôm just being me so I shouldn‚Äôt worry because my true friends will understand!"
991,isfp,"I don't like communicating at all, I express myself like shit. Of course I do it because it's necessary, but since it's always trash text I don't do that often. 
Which is kinda weird because sometimes I have this flow of words on me and just HAVE to express it to someone (sorry bf!)"
992,isfp,"Contrary to all the comments here, I like texting. I prefer it more than talking on the phone. It gives me time to think up of a good response. I don‚Äôt text 24/7. Only about half an hour in total a day. I often text to a friend of mine and share jokes and stuff. And then I would take a few days break from it. "
993,isfp,"Usually, I'm a really outgoing person and lately, I've realized that I lost my charm of doing so. I took the test again and it turns out I became an Introvert. Personally I think that's fine, because I stress out over how people feel and react sometimes. 
Question: How do you guys meet new girls? Cause I have troubles with being clingy and holding onto false hopes."
994,isfp,"I also went from ESFP to ISFP. I bet you still have your charm (I think I still do, when I'm in the right mood). I bet a good portion of the population is on the border between E/I so I wouldn't let it affect your self-perception.
I met all of my S.O.'s through work which is has some pros and cons lol so idk if I'd recommend that. The animal shelter idea is too cute, you should do that."
995,isfp,"I took the test about two or so years ago. I got ISFP. So I brewed on it for a while, and eventually decided I would see what the deal with MBTI was on Reddit. That was a few months back. I had been posting and lurking and whatnot for about a month when I had my doubts that I fit in with you guys. So naturally I retook the test. ISFP again. I decided to read through the entire passage the website has. It was fairly accurate about how I see myself.
I put an end to the doubts, and just continued on as normal. About another month passed, and I realized again I didn't seem to fit in naturally here. I can't really put my finger on what seemed off either. Another thing that got my mind on it was seeing what people from anime were typed as. I would see characters typed ISFP that I thought weren't anything like me. I assumed it to be mistyping the character. So I continued to look into it. The typing appeared consistent on most of the characters I came across. So I decided the only thing that made sense was that I was mistyped.
I decided to take the test through a different source. I got ISTP with this source. I thought it wasn't too weird that a letter would change, and I decided to go read the passage on the ISTP. I am flabbergasted how accurate it sounded. I had heard so many accounts of people being surprised just how accurate their MBTI profile was, and I never really saw the hype. It was because I was reading the wrong one.
I went back to tumblr and pinterest to see those things where it lists every type with some stupid statement. I had never thought those were accurate. I had also been skimming them for ISFP and INTJ (My two best friends are INTJ's) So I decided to go through and see what those had written for ISTP's. Once again was a little surprised how accurate some of it was. It was still trashy like I expected, but it was much much more accurate.
I went on to read the ISTP subreddit for a few days now, and like wow. It is so much more relatable. Honestly I feel stupid. I had been performing some mental gymnastics to draw similarities in everything I read here and myself. I didn't have to stretch too far, but I did have to stretch. The main difference is that I am not artistic in the slightest. I can mimic what other people do quite well, and had stretched to believe I was artistic in some manner. That, however, isn't artistic at all. Thats pretty mechanical. Do this, do this, do this, and bam you have art. That isn't art. I'm not an artist. I'm not an adventurer.
Still love this place, and love you all."
996,isfp,"Damn, that‚Äôs really interesting! I remember reading a lot of your posts/comments, in hindsight perhaps it wasn‚Äôt quite ISFP..? Who knows lmao. You definitely strike me as much more ISTP but I wasn‚Äôt aiming to question anything.
Anyways it‚Äôs really cool you found your type - it‚Äôs a great feeling! Make sure to stick around this sub tho.. ;p"
997,isfp,"I did this too but with INFP. I think I was answering the questions more of what I idealize instead of what I actually do. (I never think living in the moment is very romantic, but I don‚Äôt know anything else. Lol.) When I started looking into ISFP it just made so much more sense and I relate to most posts posted here. Hah."
998,isfp,"Wow you sound just like my bf!! He tests INFJ but I've been having the hardest time nailing down his type 100%.
Do you happen to recall some of those ""aha moment"" lists/resources? If you do, please link. Maybe it'd help him out.
Also do you find yourself ""romanticizing"" the INFJ description and kinda wanting to be that type? Like the rare mystical philosophical stereotype, lol."
999,isfp,I plan to. I am a mod after all. For no good reason mind you. Someone complained about one of my posts and it got taken down. I went to the mod who took it down and complained that it was bullshit it got taken down. Not isfp related my ass. Someone just didnt take kindly to a racist joke. Two thirds of the shit on this sub isn't related to being isfp. Something funny about that though. Exactly what would happen to an istp isn't it. He made me a mod because he didn't wanna deal with me.
1000,isfp,"I worked at a hobby shop for a few years. I got into playing Warhammer 40k. Whenever I had any down time I would paint war gaming terrain for the store. Buildings, trucks, ruins, the tables themselves, trees, rocks, etc..  All the tools and materials were supplied to me. I would just link up a YouTube video and watch a guy paint and after some time I could replicate his actions without the videos. There was nothing artistic about it. I also did the same to paint my own models. I only bothered to paint my own models because you were given a free reroll once per game if you painted your models. Im competitive AF. I wanted that reroll. Nothing artistic about it."
1001,isfp,"I don‚Äôt see an issue with an ISTP mod. And I see what you mean about not everything being related to ISFPs directly, but it‚Äôs one of the only subs where I don‚Äôt see an issue with that. I think the sub is more just a chill, nice place for ISFPs (or others) to come and talk. None of us relaxed, easy going types really have an issue with that. I think we all try to make contributions have at least a vague link to the purpose. Though, having a mod with less bias to regulate it from being a complete shit show sounds good.
I remember first typing as INFJ (darn 16 personalities) and feeling the same way you did. Kinda fit in, but not right. Yet it felt almost a shame to be leaving the community I once identified with. Was a good opportunity to understand a type in such a unique way though, I‚Äôm sure your experience is similar."
1002,isfp,"Lmao! Well I‚Äôm not married, just dating. And managing money for the Marine Corps is a lot easier than personal financial responsibility. I‚Äôve also only stayed in the MC to give myself no choice but stability, since I‚Äôm naturally uncommitted to jobs/careers. But I‚Äôm flattered that you remember me from my few posts üòÇ‚ô•Ô∏è"
1003,isfp,"What‚Äôd you end up doing instead? Every day is a struggle for me because I feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong career path. 
That‚Äôs funny, I got my job because I scored super high on the ASVAB but my mechanical skill was too low to do anything of that nature. Another reason why I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm an ISTP, I just think I‚Äôve been suppressing trauma and emotions for 28+ years until I finally realized it and I‚Äôve been on a path of healing. Which may explain the variation is test results "
1004,isfp,"Hmm. The short answer is that I got married, had a bunch of kids, and became a stay-at-home-mom.
Obviously I‚Äôm leaving a lot out. I can DM you a few more details, none of which are too exciting I‚Äôm afraid..."

1006,isfp,"I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?
Thank you!"
1007,isfp,"I always feel that it seems awkward to be ""asked out"".  I like to let something progress naturally from shared activities/interests, or kind of a mutual understanding that we want to spend more time together.  If we like and understand each other, we'll text/talk more and more, get to know each other better, and grow closer, and when we finally discuss our ""relationship status"" there are no surprises. This is how my happiest relationships have always begun. 
I only want to date someone that I'm head over heels for, which doesn't happen every year. "
1008,isfp,"I'd find it awkward to be approached unless I knew them well. I prefer to meet and get to know someone naturally, then for it to get romantic there'd have to be sort a of ""click,"" where I would sense that neither of us get tired of each other through harmless jabber. 
Even if they're really cute, the chances are, the relationship won't go very far if there was no ""click"" beforehand.
Basically, ISFPs prefer not to rush into dating someone, I think."
1009,isfp,"I would very much appreciate a non-romantic fashion: E.g. a sports activity, exotic food with friendly conversation, some urban exploration or a hike. Something to get to know each other. 
(I'm German, so none of those strict dating rules I hear about from America.) "
1010,isfp,"We are probably ten times more likely to ask someone out that we are already friends with. My nerves would kill me if I had to ask out a stranger. You won't catch me in a bar, but funky restaurants are cool and so are book stores"
1011,isfp,"The idea of an interaction occurring solely from a place of romance stresses me out and makes me uncomfortable. I think that's why it's hard for me to actually connect with people through online dating? The end game is already set up in the foundation. So if a stranger right out the gate asked me out I will probably say no unless conversation starts in a way that doesn't imply they are interested in me especially if they are mainly physically interested in me. That sounds crazy, but I just feel weird if someone who knows nothing about me is super into me from first impressions. I feel like I didn't earn the desire if that makes sense. 
If a stranger saw me with a book about a specific topic and they also read the book and decided to start a conversation with me about it, I'd be more inclined to go on a date with them if conversation went smoothly and we clicked. If a stranger from a bar, or anywhere for that matter, asked me out because he likes what he sees i'm 100% not taking it seriously. The furthest that will go is a fwb or text buddies.
I'd prefer to actually know or meet someone through similarities. So like a hobby or class. If I don't meet someone through that way, there would just have to be some kind of deeper base that goes further than looks. I guess i'm kind of contradictory though because I also wouldn't think of dating someone i'm not sexually/physically attracted to. I'm not sure if that's actually what you're asking though. "
1012,isfp,The most important thing is if I already like the person AND want to be in a relationship at the time. I don't like it when people I don't really know ask me out. I think it's sweet when he seems vulnerable and nervous asking me out; it shows sincerity. 
1013,isfp,"So, i called a friend into a room together with me and asked her advice in a situation I was in. This then escalated into a 5 hour discussion where she started talking about her personal life including a few awkward things she went through, books we both read and then music we both listen to. I also put some of my personal life out there and responded as she went abouts with each topic. 
I've been quite good friends with her for a while, had our ups and downs but we both work in a group of 8 people. We're all quite good friends but because  of the group setting its hard to read her."
1014,isfp,"id say try to get to hang out with her one on one a couple more times and see how things go and if its any different. she obviously seems comfortable around you so i dont think shed decline. but i wouldnt base any final conclusions off this one instance, you make it sound like this is the first time youve interacted with her at this level.
basically try building the relationship up a bit more and then youll most likely know how she feels by then. and even if youre still not sure, at that point itll be ok to reach out and ask her if shes into the idea of you two. i know from experience that Fi doms really want to know a person before making up their minds about them."
1015,isfp,"Could be, but not necessarily. I'm certain she feels comfortable with you and also likes to spend time with you. Did she show any sign of being into you besides that? Discussions can escalate really easily with me and a friend. Specially when it's 1 or 2 people at most, which doesn't mean I'm interested in them."
1016,isfp,"Pretty fun and busy so far. 
Been going to the gym with my friends 2-3 times a week on weekdays. Then literally having parties/hangouts every weekend since the year started.  
And i just met a cute and funny ESFJ girl last week. Though i don't think i have been upfront and honest with their too much :/ .
i think i could use some encouragement on that part."

I'll start exercising, and hopefully recover my lost passion with art and books. I'm tired of pretending to be an ENTJ. 
Time to prepare a future for me, with a steady job and wonderful afternoons."
1019,isfp,I took it once and i dont remember the number exactly but it was average. It wasnt a real iq test though just a sample version so im taking that as indication that im still probably a super genius.
1020,isfp,"YES I only ever show my true self to my family. I space out a lot because I don't really care about impressing other people (even though I dislike being judged). That may have something to do with being ""passive"". I wish people would LISTEN when we do have something to say. But then again, I don't really listen to other people..."
1021,isfp,"Hell yeah, that is me. I usually just want things to go smoothly, so I go along with whatever agressive people say, but recently it has been really getting on my nerves, but when I say a super normal ""no, I can't do that, sorry"", it's like I insulted someone's dead mom. Because it used to be ""oh don't worry about todayismanday, they are definitely cool with this"", no! Ugh.
Just keep practicing being assertive though, it is worth it."
1022,isfp,"Not really. A guy once told me I don't talk much but when I first talk it's really worth listening to. I've noticed this personally too, when I speak up the room usually goes quiet (which can be somewhat anxiety provoking lol)."
1023,isfp,"This was an interesting question friend my asked me yesterday. It took me a while to think about it. I wanted to say happy, however I don't feel happiness all the time. It's not like I'm sad all the time either tho. So I just said I feel 'at peace'. I don't know wether that is an emotion or not but that was my answer haha. "
1024,isfp,"According to my observations, Fi doms give off a vibe of seething inner rage. Ni doms seem merely sad/grieving. Happiness seems to belong to extroverted P types. Explosive anger to Te types. I get no vibes from Ti doms :P"
1025,isfp,"Im blessed and almost never feel depressed/sad. I wont even quantify that feeling with something as high as 1% of the time because that would still be an overestimate. I am a bundle of joy like 90% of the time, and filled with white hot rage the other 10%. It can change from one to the other as easily as a light switch is flipped. My mood swings are like Hades in Disney's Hercules."
1026,isfp,"The most? Discontentment. I'm an extreme perfectionist and no matter what something can be made better. The aesthetics of my environment, of myself, my knowledge, my emotional intelligence, my sense of humor, cooking skills, there's always something to improve and it's like I never have any rest, never have that feeling that something is done and I can stop. I'm like 90% pretty sure it's what lead to my eating disorder."
1027,isfp,Lol hope this isn‚Äôt TMI but... I‚Äôve cried while having sex 3 different times. Once out of pure love. Another time was from being upset with my partner and feeling emotionally disconnected like I couldnt stop thinking about the issues in our relationship. 
1028,isfp,"I mostly feel anger, joy, anxiety, and contentment if I had to narrow down the feelings. 
However, I find that I‚Äôm most susceptible to the feelings of those around me, and the empath in me will begin to pick up on those feelings and react accordingly. "
1029,isfp,"ISTJs seem to have the Te anger thing going for them, but it‚Äôs hidden, like a landmine. ISFJs have the Fe thing going. But I can‚Äôt seem to decide what kind of emotion Fe gives off. Maybe because it‚Äôs more like a mirror, reflecting others‚Äô emotions, and not really giving off a feeling of its own."
1030,isfp,"Same! Sometimes I just cant control how strongly I feel, like if I‚Äôm embarrassed or feel awkward in an uncomfortable setting, maybe around a lot of people I dont know, I just close up and tell myself to in my fucking tears. I hate that about me."
1031,isfp,"Hey! I'm just in the best mood I've been in for a while now. What's up with you guys? How are you? Tell me about yourselves! 
And don't be afraid to write life stories in the comments! I know us ISFP's are great at oversharing and storytelling once we get going XD"
1032,isfp,"INTJ party crasher here!
Howdy! Gosh, I wish I was such high spirits. 
I'm just so embarrassed because of this thing that recently happened in my ceramics class. There's this one girl in there who I'm kinda' sorta' crushing on, but I don't know her all that well and she already has a boyfriend so I know that I'm never going to go beyond having a crush. Anyway, during a long and boring lecture, I noticed that she had her hands placed behind her back in this really, really cute way. I must've spent a half hour just smiling like a lobotomized dork. 
Two days later, I realized that it actually looked like I was staring at her butt like a total creeper :| 
Maybe it's just me, but she (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the class [I'm the only male in a class of twelve]) seems to be pretty distant now. 
The worst part is that I just can't explain myself. I mean, I don't even know if she or anybody else knows or if I'm just being paranoid. Besides, how does someone go up to a girl and be like ""hey, so it looked like I was gazing at your ass, but I was honestly just crushing on your cute hands?"" 
But anyway, how're you doing? Did anything cause your good mood, or was it just something that happened?"
1033,isfp,"Oh my, I know how that feels. Sometimes I look at people and just zone out, or even when I am looking at their body it's like ""wowie everyone is so different golly gee I do love how unique this person is and how I get to enjoy their presence in peace!""
Just try to relax, nobody probably saw and you probably feel like they're distant even if nothing has changed because you feel guilty. And remember that you've done nothing wrong! If anyone confronts you, just say it. ""Well I just thought it was cute how she had her hands behind her...I didn't realize how it seemed until it was too late""
Also, nothing really happened in particular! I suffer from depression, so really any day I'm not stressed is a great day, like today! I'm feeling great, and I want you to feel great too, so stay optimistic üòâüëç"
1034,isfp,"(guess I should ask how you are) your title post resonates with me because for like the first time in my life I am actually open to making friends, luckily I have made some good ones too. but for pretty much my entire life, I haven't had any actual friends, in elementary I had two friends but they weren't really my friends,  they generally ignored me and left me alone a lot. it got better in ""middle school"" and made my first friends, but one year everyone had gone to school left, and I was left with a lot of new people I didn't know. one year something happened, but I don't want to talk about that. next year I had made some really good friends which now, present day, I have known for a while now. it's something I really appreciate now, you know it's nice to have someone you can socialize with, so there is a fraction of my life story, just because you asked, lol, there's more I could say but I have to restrain myself somewhat and it's also kinda late"
1035,isfp,"Aw, thank you! I feel reassured knowing that other people have lived through similar experiences. I'll take your advice into consideration, too; it's probably just me, but I should just tell the truth if someone calls me out on it. It could be uncomfortable, but, then again, lying about it would probably only make me feel worse about the situation. 
Also, you have depression, too? Man, that sucks; I'm sorry that you've had to slog through that river of garbage. Still, the fact that you're still managing to have good days despite the fact that your brain and biology are rebelling against you is nothing short of commendable. Seriously, give yourself credit for doing better; you really deserve it :)
Oh, that reminds me of something! Apparently depression may involve more than reduced neuronal levels of serotonin, norepinephrine (which is the precursor to adrenaline), and/or dopamine. For example, we know that short-term sleep deprivation can have a potent antidepressant effect but that long-term sleep deprivation can cause depression in so-called ""healthy"" individuals. Furthermore, depression seems to have a relationship with inflammation. Like, have you ever noticed how a lot of depressive symptoms overlap with sickness behaviors (that is, always being tired, feeling irritable, over or undersleeping, wanting to do nothing, withdrawing from social circles, general aches, appetite changes, etc.)? That is because both conditions involve excessive amounts of inflammation. I'm not as familiar with the inflammatory dimension of depression as I am with the neurotransmitter dimension, so I'd suggest checking out this link; it raises quite a few interesting points.
But hey, if you're interested, I could share what has worked (and what could work) for my depression with you. I mean, you probably know a lot about how to manage it already, but still; there's a chance that I at least know of one thing that may be of benefit to you. Or, you know, you could just send me a PM or something if you're ever having a hard time. I can't say that I can relate exactly to what you're going through (after all, you're a different person with different experiences), but I can at least listen; that's gotta count for something, right?
One last thing: I noticed in another comment you made on this post that you were playing Pokemon. Which version were you playing? Is it your favorite or is your favorite version from another generation? Have you been playing Pokemon for a long time, or did you just pick it up recently?"
1036,isfp,"Church sounds fun, I go to a Methodist church. I'm not a religious person myself, but I do like the morals taught and it's a wonderful experience going, so I don't mind going every Sunday. 
Plus, they love me because I always doll myself up real good for the morning service XD"
1037,isfp,"Thank you for the link and the long reply! All the advice is very helpful and I appreciate you sharing your experiences.
I'm playing leaf green right now, but yellow was my favorite as a kid and I'm completely bias to it still XD"
1038,isfp,"Nice. I dont consider myself as an overly religuos person by I do consider myslef a Christian. I like some of the messages and I like hanging out with the people there. Just out of curiosiry, do you know your SO's type?"
1039,isfp,"Nice, It's good to be open minded about those sort of things.
I was just curious to see what some of the types we are attracted to, Even though I am well aware that it shouldn't really matter what type they are in terms of compatibility and more based on the actual person themselves but I just wanted to see from other people experience of what type we can get along with. I know that, in the past I have fallen for, ENFJ's, ESFJ's (I've had one fall for me a while ago), INFJ's and even other ISFP's but sadly I have never been in a relationship anyone yet."
1040,isfp,"Don't feel bad, you'll find the right one! It's never too late in life to fall in love.
I've fallen for lots of people, but I don't think I ever really truly loved any of them until my SO. I think us ISFP just give everyone the benefit of the doubt to start with, and try to believe everyone they meet are genuinely good people until proven otherwise.
All the people I fell for were very extroverted and confident. I absolutely ate it up, but it was only sexual attraction, I discovered. 
Once I met my SO I knew almost immediately he was the one. I wasn't hanging out with him expecting sex, I was hanging out with him anticipating cuddles and video games and talking. I wanted to go places with him and show him everything I thought was neat. Sex was just an amazing plus!
Sorry for the rant XD I got a little excited"
1041,isfp,"Naw, thanks :) it's all good. As a male I used to sometimes feel envious towards extroverts because it felt like they were the ones who have no trouble getting a girl if they wanted because they would most the time have better social skills and social enegy compared to a guy like me who can be pretty shy around a girl I had feeling for. I used to feel very inferior because of it. I didn't like how I just didn't have the ability to talk up a girl. But I have learnt that it is sill possible for someone to like me for who I am. And because I am only 19 I just have to be patient and wait for the right girl and I look forward to that time that I can spend time with someone special."
1042,isfp,"Particularly abstract philosophy. Political I can stomach, but my boyfriend who studies it recently asked me to prove why I don't think a table has consciousness. 
I'm just totally adverse to that type of conversation, being so inapplicable to anything in everyday life. My first instinct was to give out to him for wasting my time :P 
There is however a really large part of me that has always, long before meeting my SO, wanted to be that type of person who finds philosophy fascinating and can quote Plato off the cuff. Intellectual dreaming I suppose! Anyone else find this?
I read a while back on an MBTI forum that INTJ's are the college professors who wish to be artists and ISFP are artists that wish to be college professors!"
1043,isfp,"Kind of infuriating. I graduated from the program, but too much time was spent on abstract discussion than the application of ideas in life. That's why I really liked the ancient Chinese philosophers when I got to study them. It was all about the path to a better life. However I did enjoy the process of abstractly breaking down ideas, but I prefer to do that alone in my head.
When people hear I studied philosophy, many of them actually get excited and launch into dense, abstract discussions at the drop of a hat. I don't think I'm going to tell people anymore."
1044,isfp,"I hated it when we would get/practice it in school and I still hate it today. First of all, a lot of philosophical questions are pointless and don't matter and, well, they have no answer. Mulling them over for hours or days won't create and answer. Go do something that has at least a bit of use to someone somewhere with you time."
1045,isfp,"Philosophy in general I think is cool, and there are a few things I can get into and discuss if the topic comes up, though it makes me feel uneasy sometimes.
That question in particular though (or one like it)? ""Infuriating"" is a bit strong -- I wouldn't get angry at that. But I would definitely shut down and refuse to move the conversation along. As I saw others on here say, there's just no point (for me at least) and the ultimate answer is probably that there is none. There are just certain things we can't know for sure."
1046,isfp,"Lol at your last paragraph. There's definitely some truth to that. You should check out the partially examined life podcast. They've done enough episodes you could probably find one you're interested in, and they're good about keeping the tone fun and somewhat light."
1047,isfp,"I find it kind of pointless to discuss things that don't have a definite answer and it just a point of discussion.
I have to DO things, I can't sit around and talk about them. I learn from DOING things not talking."
1048,isfp,"i think i have met several Isfps are overreacting for little things. For example, my ex classmates post if she should be friend with her ex, and he replied for long and tell her what he feels about it, and his post last about 20-30 lines. I don't remember well"
1049,isfp,"Do we overreact over little things? No - I personally wouldn‚Äôt say we do. I don‚Äôt at least. I think we‚Äôre pretty chill, relaxed and forgiving.
On the other hand.. you mention the writing loads part? Boy am I guilty of that. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs over little things; but if something bothers me or evokes feelings, I do tend to write big long paragraphs in an attempt to get everythingggg across. Hell - I‚Äôm probably doing that in this comment. I could‚Äôve just said ‚ÄúNo, but kind of‚Äù."
1050,isfp,"HOW DARE YOU SAY SUCH A THING WELL I NEVER  but i think that from a certain perspective it might seem that way. I‚Äôm introverted, my feelings are a big part of my life, and as a perceiver I like to ponder over and ruminate about things. It‚Äôs not always that I am actually having a strong reaction to something, it‚Äôs more likely that I just spend a little longer than average thinking about it and figuring out how I feel and why I feel that way. 
I think most people don‚Äôt analyze their feelings in depth as much as ixfps do, unless it is a big deal, so when an isfp sits there and goes into great detail about the who-what-where-why, other people interpret that to mean we are having a strong reaction.
(there isn‚Äôt a ton of info here but on a side note; posting anything about your ex in a place they can see it is... not my favorite thing... i generally try to maintain mutual respect with my exes and would be kinda pissed if they mentioned me but that may be just me.. i probly wouldn‚Äôt write out a big ol response but if if i was younger maybe I would have?)"
1051,isfp,"I see. Well idk the context, but perhaps the answer to your question is yes. 
Thing is, I wouldn‚Äôt call it overreacting in the way the word is usually used. I doubt he‚Äôs genuinely bothered, or angry/upset or frustrated or anything. Sometimes I can be unbothered by something but still write out a lot more than I should."
1052,isfp,"This is just my opinion, but I believe our true reason to be here is to simply live and fully be here in the present. It helps us understand ourselves better when we are isolated, alone with ourselves. We can extraordinarily feel the sensations around us, even to an intuitive level. 
This is what I‚Äôve noticed, but our interior functions really give us a benefit to living in the present moment.
Edit: we all kind of ‚Äòget it‚Äô, despite personality type. However, this is just a recurring thing I‚Äôve noticed often with other ISFPs."
1053,isfp,"I agree, but on the other hand, doesn't everyone have their own definition of ""I get it""? I mean I completely agree with your post, but an INTP might think something like ""I truly get it, life is about gaining knowledge""."
1054,isfp,"One of the peak moments in my life is when I am truly present in the moment while walking in nature. I immerse myself with the surroundings and all the physical sensations in their rawest forms. I felt truly alive for the first time. It felt so vibrant and rich... i would closely observe the rocks, trees, leaves and flowers and see their beauty... "
1055,isfp,yes. from my experience it seems we feel all the misery and pleasure completely through. no matter how much we try to numb ourselves to the experience.. it‚Äôs never over until we feel it. if that makes sense? totally agree

1059,isfp,"An mbti blog on tumblr called Funky MBTI Fiction pointed out that Luke has a lot of trouble when he first starts practicing using his powers because he's so grounded in the present, and can't just let his mind go. Sounds Se to me."
1060,isfp,ok so recently ive been really getting into philosophy and abstract nonsense (cuz im the most sensitive piece of sh--) . so ive retaken the mbti test to see if i had changed personality types and sure enough i did (although my iN and Se were nearly the same). so now i am an INFP slash ISFP. but both my N and S are equally strong I think. is anyone confused as well and is unsure about their identity. 
1061,isfp,"Actually I'm a former INFP turned ISFP. Still, my preference to sensing is around 10-20%, depending on the test. I'm still figuring out what this means, but as I understand it, the two types are very similar."
1062,isfp,"The main difference that comes to my head first is that ISFPs can sever ties with people more easily than INFP. This is because INFPs see the possibilities that they are wrong in their judgements, ISFPs see things for what they are, to them an asshole is an asshole."
1063,isfp,"The best way to determine your type is by looking into cognitive functions. That's how I determined that I am an ISFP even though I used to think I was an INFP, which I scored as on tests. I have a lot of INFP traits such as extreme hate of criticism, shyness, tumultuous emotions, love for all things esoteric, interest in philosophy, and hermitting. But I started questioning my type when I realized that I really am a realist. I have a hard time seeing how things are related (Ni rather than Ne) and I love nature and amassing life experiences (Se). Apparently INFPs are better at expressing themselves verbally. I've also noticed that ISFPs have a quirky sense of fashion. I personally find it very hard to blend in, fashion-wise. I just don't have an eye for it.
Bottom line: MBTI isn't a box to put yourself in. Not all ISFPs will be the same and it's hard to be certain of your type."
1064,isfp,"Ha, I NEVER burn bridges. To me, that means failure. Giving up. There's rarely so toxic a person that I want them COMPLETELY out of my life. I might limit contact...but I always like to keep something there.
However, this only applies to people I'm close with. And I guess I don't consider myself close to a ton of people. And I TYPICALLY don't get too close to assholes (although there have been a couple exceptions)."
1065,isfp,"This, exactly. I would say at LEAST half the time I test as INFP. Probably more often than ISFP. But sometimes I'll test ISFP with a REALLY high score in sensing.
For a long time I was unsure, as many aspects of both fit me. I always leaned a little more towards ISFP, even though I'm not terribly creative.
But as soon as I looked into the functions and the differences between how ISFPs and INFPs take in their surroundings and process information, I was POSITIVE I'm an ISFP. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind."
1066,isfp,"Mine are:

A soft orange red, like a red sunset or salt lamp 
The emerald greens of maple trees, preferably two shades together for depth
The light yellow before the golden hour hits, which is about the shade of very old paper
Brownish black
Cobalt
"
1067,isfp,"Similar to your cobalt, i'm liking the twilighty blues/blacks/purples lately. they feel like dreams. normally i'm more autumnal. i think it's so warm and bright now, everything's too clear. i like the incoherence.

1070,isfp,"Im not trying to be vain but i get a lot of attention. I am told that i am kind hearted and very sexy. I think its because i have a fit body but im not that pretty in the face IMO. I am very shy and dont approach or try to make conversations much. A lot of people said im very intimidating at first but once they talk to me i am very down to earth, a good listener, and overall very sexy? Ive watched a couple of videos and they even mentioned that isfp women are hot. Why?? What makes us isfp girls sexy to you?  Is it our energy or our appearance?"
1071,isfp,"As an ENTP, I have to admit both Fi and Se are strong alpha qualities. I had a debate with another ENTP on a Discord server about it and we both agreed that Ti and Ne are too passive compared to Fi and Se. You guys have set morals and good control over your bodies, which make healthy ISFPs really attractive in my opinion. Intuitives like me are great at hiding themselves in their head so that we compensate this by finding niches (which is where our arrogance about being unique stems from)."
1072,isfp,"I‚Äôm fat and I‚Äôm never called sexy sooo it‚Äôs probably the fact you‚Äôre skinny. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I‚Äôm assuming a big thing with you being called it often is because of how warm we are to other people. People feel more disarmed and from what I‚Äôve learned working in a male dominated industry, there are certain men (and women but more so men in my experience. It‚Äôs the way society has taught some ppl.) who feel entitled to comment on someone‚Äôs body."
1073,isfp,"ISFP guy here. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever been told I‚Äôm attractive üò¢. But personally I find the quiet, down to earth, go with the flow style that ISFPs tend to have attractive. I can also say that other guys don‚Äôt share this view so depends on the guy.  Honestly the most attractive thing regardless of type is just be you and be loyal."
1074,isfp,"don't think i've been called attractive either, probably because i'm not objectively good-looking/attractive/sexy? when i meet people, they often tell me i'm intimidating, which seems to be more of a reflection of my emotional reservations. because of that i'd have to add to what others are saying about ISFP warmth and empathy. it definitely helps to be objectively attractive but for the most part it seems to be our energy"
1075,isfp,"i have been wondering this too- I have been told I'm attractive/good looking too, but I don't think type has much to do with that. though I have read the same thing about ISFPs so it might have something to do with how we carry ourselves"
1076,isfp,"Yes.. a lot of people open up to me. I work as a nail tech and most of my clients tell me their problems. Marriage, kids, cheating spouse, ect. Sometimes i wonder why the hell are they telling me these things but i guess its because im attentive and willing to listen. Ive been told i have a welcoming energy. I have 2 small children and i get a lot of comments that they would never thought i had kids because of my body. I do yoga almost everyday and workout 3 times a week and eat healthy. Im flattered but its quite annoying and uncomfortable especially when i work with a lot of other women so all they do is talk about other people qnd assume i got work done. Lol"
1077,isfp,Lol ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Well I‚Äôve met a few girls which sound very similar to you but usually don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre attractive. At first you can‚Äôt pick it because they‚Äôre quite but once you get to know them it‚Äôs like üòç lol
1078,isfp,"Be genuine and authentic. Its a big factor for me. For me, I don‚Äôt like pretend stuff or small talks. Skip the small talks and ask them questions about themselves. Find out about their hobbies and interests. To instantly connect with me,  just talk about anime lol. And I wouldn‚Äôt stop chatting. 
Just show genuine interest in them, like they are the most fascinating creatures in the world and they will love it. I think. Can‚Äôt say this for every ISFPs. "
1079,isfp,"Be genuine and authentic. If you are empathetic, humble and considerate , I'll think highly of you. Basically people with high integrity and can give space. Also, you are going to have to be proactive, because we(I) dont initiate communication."
1080,isfp,Probably helps if you do most of the talking at first üòÇ but you can‚Äôt force a friendship. Talk too much and they‚Äôll feel like they can‚Äôt get a word in. Don‚Äôt talk enough and the friendship will never bloom 
1081,isfp,"What I like in a friend is when they don't jump to completely shut down something I say, even if they disagree. It's okay to disagree with me, but try to understand why I feel the way I do because I will do that for you.
Instead of ""Um, you're absolutely wrong!,"" I'll word it this way: ""Really? What made you feel that way?"" And I'll continue to ask questions. I show my disagreement in asking the questions versus blatantly calling them out. Sometimes the questioning changes my mind or gives me even more respect for their opinion. I like to find understanding and common ground with friends, even with things we disagree on. Let's talk about the things we disagree on, because it would be boring never to do so, but let's also move to the topics that are more fun. Maybe it sounds fake to others, but it feels invalidating to one's experiences and intellect when someone bluntly shuts you down. I see my ISFP approach to disagreement as focusing on common ground and striving for unity. All this advice is for someone who I want to be friends with, mind you, and I do like making friends. But if someone does not have the goal of connection, and it becomes obvious to me, I have no issue 'telling them like it is.' But I'll exit the conversation pretty quickly because I can't stand confrontation.
It's why I never enjoyed when a man was interested in me and teased me relentlessly about my likes, dislikes, and opinions. Or frequently tells me 'you're wrong.' (Insert jokes about women always needing to be right). The teasing approach does not work with ISFPs! Not that you asked for a romantic pointer, haha, but there's a bonus tip."
1082,isfp,"Make plans, but dont be disappointed if we cancel it. But if we do it consistently, it probably means that we dont like you. Take things slow, because we like to take time to get comfortable with you and anaylze if you are worth it.Also, dont be messaging constantly."
1083,isfp,Like does this person start talking about something I get excited about? Are they open and friendly and go out of their way to include me? I'd start looking for signs that they want to be my friend and then learn more about them to see if I like them. 
1084,isfp,"Hello everyone, true blue ISFP male here. I have identified my strengths and weaknesses - doing physical activities, being carefree, being slightly dreamy and mostly lazy, can't plan ahead for my life, etc. - typical ISFP personality. 
I am in late 20s. I have tried many solo sports. Only things that have stuck is tennis and powerlifting. Activity wise I have tried many things - cooking, woodworking, fishing, shooting, writing, listening to music, etc - I like most of them and keep switching back and forth. Career wise it sucks that after 1-2 years, I get bored and have to look for something new (have done it twice now). Currently trying my hand at startups but nearing my 2 year mark, so losing steam. Even though its going good but it will take another 2 years of hard work to earn any kind of real money.
I need to fill my day with activities proactively, otherwise I feel life is too slow and boring. Even though I am lazy, I hate sitting around. Day full of activities makes me engaged in the moment, but there is no unifying purpose to the whole thing.
So my question to you all - Do anybody else feel the same thing? How do we find a larger purpose & meaning in life when we find all tasks mundane after sometime? Will we be always hopping from one activity to another? 
Really looking for some good suggestions.
P.S. I am not depressed."
1085,isfp,"Just think about the things you want to do in this lifetime, your goals & ambitions. If you have none, spend some time to yourself to figure it out or just look at what other people are doing out there & pick what seems cool. 
For me it has been pretty easy to imagine which things I would ideally want in my life, but it might be different for other ISFPs. (I do seem to have trouble setting those goals in action, though.)"
1086,isfp,"For me, being outdoors helps alot.  The outdoors is always changing with seasons, weather, plants, etc.   So, I love seeing the changes and it makes it feel different and not boring.   
I dont know what to tell you about the job thing, never been good at it either."
1087,isfp,"Ok, maybe this isn‚Äôt the BEST solution, but it is a solution... but have you thought about joining the military?? I‚Äôm not sure if you live in the U.S. or not, but I‚Äôve grown up with a dad and brother in the Airforce and I can honestly say that there are benefits. For the Airforce specifically, the shortest contract is 4 years active duty, but that can give you more options to figure out jobs you like, travel, have a steady income, and once you get out, you‚Äôll have a GI Bill if you want to go back to school. Just something to think about??"
1088,isfp,"(ENFP here) I don't have any good suggestions for you, but I've always been told to ask yourself questions and to journal/write out all your thoughts until they become clearer for you and lead you in a particular direction."
1089,isfp,"I feel the same way. I'm 24 but the only things I'm really into are weightlifting and drawing, but career wise I'm lost. I don't have many marketable skills either so I am a bit stuck.
I'm not really sure about finding a purpose for life, right now I don't think there is much of one- I want to have a wife & kids someday and draw cool pictures, but otherwise I have no idea. I'm trying to give myself some time to think about what my next steps will be, but it has been very hard and I don't feel like I've made much progress. have been feeling very apathetic about most stuff lately,  maybe I'm a bit depressed but I don't know for sure."
1090,isfp,"Agreed. Thats how I went from book reading to activities man. Now anything bigger than just occupying with activities will require careful planning, focus, drive for a considerably long duration and most importantly desire/ambition, all of which seem lacking in me right now. 
Anything cool that I observe outside seems good in theory, but when I try to do them, I realize I dont give a shit about most of them.
Thanks though for your reply."
1091,isfp,"Hey you guys or gals. Wlw INTP here and I am wondering about how ISFPs come to terms with being queer. How long did it take? What possibly triggered it? How do you feel about the subject now? (Bonus points if you're a fellow wlw)
I hope I haven't offended anyone by asking such questions but I know that everyone's coming out experience is not the same and would like to know about what possibly goes on in someone else's head."
1092,isfp,"Several people I‚Äôve met during middle/highschool all told me it was pretty obvious I was the gay one even though I never asked anyone out directly during that time. Turns out Im the only one oblivious to my actions  at least until around 20 when I (what it feels like) suddenly had my brain expanded and started thinking about what kind of person I‚Äôve grown into and what kind of person I aspire to become. Before that I mostly observed others and thought about their motives, rarely analyzing my own. 
Once it was clear to me I was over the label pretty quickly. Having the need to identify with a certain group of people or community just feels like a nuance, I‚Äôd rather let people know me by how I act instead of giving them a list of nouns/adjectives that I want others to think of me as.
Anyways, the realization was liberating and I dont feel awkward for loving others anymore, male or female. "
1093,isfp,"To be honest, only a few people know of my bisexuality. I didn't think much of it when I was a kid, and only in college did I actually meet people who are open with their sexuality. I always found thrill in watching yuri anime though in high school, and once or twice I got quite attracted to some of my girl friends. So in college I met this intp (he is a trans boy but he didnt tell me about it yet of course, and physically he's still female). He intrigued me so and I was always very aware of him whenever he's around. I shrugged the feelings off because I've never thought about being together with a girl before. We grew close, and it kinda developed. I couldn't deny it anymore. Little did I know he was feeling the same and we got together the summer before our 3rd year in college started. He came out as trans before we got together, and my feelings decided it doesn't really care. Well I got attracted to him not knowing he was trans, so pretty much I got attracted to him as a girl, but when he told me he was actually a boi I decided it didn't really matter. That's when I realised why I seem to get butterflies back then when I steal fleeting glances at women. But when I start to ponder about it my attraction to other people actually goes beyond them being either male or female. I like them for who they are, and up until now I am conflicted with the term 'bisexual' but I still use it for lack of a better term, although 'queer' might be better. I don't know, hahah! There's still a lot to realise.
This might be a very boring story, this post isn't even asking for a love story holy shite, but that intp of mine has been a pivotal part of my life. My life has been a blur and an endless coming of going until him. He's my breath of fresh air."
1094,isfp,"Hey fellow queer lady here! 
I feel that deep down I always knew I was queer however, I pushed it aside and thought it was something I didn‚Äôt need to deal with until I was older. I was 18 when I came out to my friends, and it was when I settled in at university. I found fellow queer friends and also the people I was surrounded with were chill af, so everything went smoothly once I figured out my sexuality. I was absolutely certain when I drunkenly kissed one of my uni friends on my birthday. Something clicked in my head and It was like fireworks went off and I had found the missing puzzle piece. After that - being all excited and happy that I‚Äôd found myself - I experimented, before settling in with my long term girlfriend. 
I struggled to deal with being queer in high school quite a lot because I kept thinking ‚Äòbut what if I do like guys and I just haven‚Äôt found a one I‚Äôm attracted to‚Äô. I knew I was definitely attracted to girls but I didn‚Äôt know entirely what my sexuality was. I also couldn‚Äôt really judge how my friends would react to me coming out because they were all female, never really expressed any views and one of them was a devout Christian. I thought maybe I‚Äôd make them feel incredibly uncomfortable or something. 
Fast forward to 2 years after my uni graduation and I have a girlfriend who I live with and I‚Äôve come out to my high school friends and my family. Everyone is incredibly accepting of me, and happy for me. I have one aunt who is uncomfortable with it but I don‚Äôt see her often and she‚Äôs outnumbered by my accepting family members. Everything is great and I am comfortable and happy with being a queer lady. Overall I think the biggest struggle for me was thinking about what people would think of me if they knew, but once I overcame that and found the right group of friends, I am confident, happy and as queer as can be. :) 
Edit: (also my girlfriend is an INTP :))"
1095,isfp,"that's really sweet imo. as a trans person i don't see what would be wrong with calling yourself bisexual. because you are attracted to some women by definition you are bisexual, and identifying that way doesn't mean you see him as a woman."

1098,isfp,"So continuing off this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/5kvsvj/any_isfp_group_chats/) I've decided to come up with a ISFP Discord chat where we all can mingle with each other and chat, you know? I know we're small but I hope we can find some common ground and a place to chat :)
I won't make this a hard and fast rule but I'll trust y'all with the link here. As far as possible I'd like to keep it to people within our type though, (since I believe there are already other avenues for other types to talk to each other) I hope you don't mind? :)

1099,isfp,"I find that I learn quickest through visual learning. I like graphs and charts and if I can see it, I can probably learn it. But I find that if I learn by doing, it takes me a while but I get an overall better understanding of whatever it is.
How do the rest of you isfp's like to learn? The three main ones are visual (seeing), auditory (hearing), and kinesthetic (doing), but you may have a specific way that is unique and works best for you."
1100,isfp,"Flash cards! I'm a flash card queen. Maybe it's because I'm in school for nursing and it's mostly memorization. When I'm trying to understand a concept though, I'll draw a picture with blanks missing so I can fill them in. It definitely takes me more than just ""skimming"" information. "
1101,isfp,"Visual and kinesthetic are the two for me. If I can watch someone do something, or do something myself, I'll have it down near instantly. (As long as it clicks in my head)
For auditory, everything just passes straight through from one ear to the other. And for reading, ¬Ø(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø pretty much the same story there, except eyes rather than ears.
Not sure why it happens, and I'd love to be able to get better at retaining stuff I read or hear, but I wouldn't know where to start with that."
1102,isfp,Definitely a combination of both visual and kinesthetic. I have to see whatever im learning being performed(like holding a fork properly) or being written out(like a math equation being solved) and then after that I solidify whatever it is by doing whatever I learned.
1103,isfp,"I read that ISFPs are the most likely to be unemployed. I have a crappy part time retail job whilst looking for something more in line with my qualifications. I can't find anything. Could this be an ISFP thing? It's hard for me to stay motivated and I just don't find myself finding my -thing-
Maybe I should go back to school but then I wouldn't even know what for. "
1104,isfp,"Facing the same issue here, except I'm currently in school about to graduate. I don't even know what I want to do with my degree in terms of careers, let alone finding my first job outside of college. No motivation to work toward anything in particular, making it really hard for me to commit to getting any job besides the simple retail ones."
1105,isfp,"NO, I find it really easy to find a job - I just don't feel like going and I waste a lot of time while I am at work. I get things done, but am not a real go-getter. Fortunately, most people like me and I get along with others well... LOL - I am lazy..."
1106,isfp,"You need a guard card. Usually that consists of about 50+ hours of training including CPR and medical training. The class fees for a guard card are anywhere from $120 to $300 I think? I was actually given a sponsorship for a guard card for free. I had over 10 years martial arts experience+my college degree so they waived the guard card fees for me.
It's possible to have the fees waived, but you just have to find the right organization/sponsor for that. But even paying it is not much, since you'd probably make enough to pay for your guard card over two days overtime. And there is a lot of overtime in security if you want it.
As for the social stuff. When I say I'm a strong/hardcore ISFP I'm not exaggerating lol.
I was distant from society to begin with even before work. That's part of the reason why I looked for security work.
Because I like working without many people, or dealing with bs. 
I'm introverted to the point of almost being a hermit, even though I'm just 30. I have about 3 good friends, and that's pretty much it in person, rest of my friends are online. So I don't really feel too alone, as I talk to people online often, as well as get together with my rl friends sometimes. I also live alone, but I enjoy playing games, reading, watching movies/shows. I have hobbies and things that interest me that I work on often.
So really, I don't get bored, or ever feel that lonely. I'm pretty socialized, and I do get out for work, and for running errands, but like as for clubbing, parties and other social stuff like that it really doesn't appeal to me to begin with lol. Also I do recommend online dating, meetups and classes, for people who are true introverts, as they're good mediums to make more friends or just meet more like-minded people."
1107,isfp,I feel like this is because isfps are not strategists - instead we are tacticians.   Not ant expert or anything because i just found out about this MBTI thing at work a few weeks ago when we all took a test.  But I find it annoying when I am in a role where nothing is really defined and I dont really have a good idea of what I'm supposed to be doing. 
1108,isfp,"I've been seriously dating this girl for a few months, and just made it official recently. I believe she is an ESTJ. I think I am more sensory and go with the flow, but she is more detail oriented and schedule based.
When things are good, it's great. I think she's smart and funny and I like spending time with her. But something that worries her a lot is that she says I don't really know her. We were playing a game recently where you ask a general question, like, favorite food, and you both answer at the same time what the other persons is. She started getting really sad that I wasn't able to answer those questions, like, favorite dessert, food, etc. She said if you really like someone, things like this are just basic things you should know about someone, but I don't know, these are just things I don't really think about.
We also have a schedule when we see each other during the week, which is something I have to comply with, I'd rather see her when I want to see her, but this is just how she is. She says it helps keep her life more organized.
I'm guess I'm not really looking for advice, just wondering if other people have been through this. I do like her, and I tell her that I just think a little differently, that while something like that may be basic and natural to her, it's not something I think about normally, but I'd work on it.
EDIT: And also, when she asks for the reasons why I like her, she isn't satisfied with my answer. She wanted me to name 10 things about why I liked her, and I struggled to get to 10. I don't know, it's just, ugh, I do like her but it's hard for me to describe it to her."
1109,isfp,"/r/relationship_advice is probably a better place to ask this but I'll give you my thoughts.
I'm an ISFP and my husband is also introverted, likely an INTP. He's like you, he often cannot remember certain things including our wedding anniversary date or my birthdate. I don't mind, though. I know that he loves me, I don't need him to be able to rattle off a bunch of facts like a robot.
I think your SO sounds quite insecure and she is afraid that you don't really love her. And the scheduled hanging out time sounds really strange as well.
I think you need to sit down and really talk things out. A good relationship is 90% good communication."
1110,isfp,"I've had this too..  the person in question didn't really seem to mind but I was a bit embarrassed about how much stuff I was forgetting.  I came to the conclusion that it was just a shallow relationship and there wasn't much good in it for either of us except for the few fleeting moments of whatever that kind of sparked the whole thing in the early days.
I'm not going to say that your relationship is shallow.. but I think this is something you should read into.  I do feel that there could be some tendancy for ISFPs to not retain information if it isn't at all profound or compelling.  I know we can be very protective of our minds in the presence of dark, unwanted thoughts and feelings, retreating into some kind of bomb shelter rather than face the truth at times. "
1111,isfp,"I'm not sure whether forgetfulness is an ISFP thing. In my relationship, I'm better with details and my SO (probably an ENFP) tends to have his head in the clouds. His forgetfulness doesn't bother me because I know it's his personality and I know that he loves me. Sometimes I'm surprised by what random things he does remember.
But I do think ISFPs tend to be more ""go with the flow,"" which you seem to be. You and your SO might just have a clash of personalities if she's that detail-oriented and focused on facts and schedules. It sounds like you're trying really hard to meet her in the middle. I hope she can do the same for you."
1112,isfp,ESTJ is fucking hard to deal with. I sometimes wonder if they are actually human robots. They can't get out of their way of thinking. IMO ISFP and ESTJ make a horrible match. ISFP is like the wanderer and ESTJ is like the no fuck you stay put and do what I say.
1113,isfp,"It's a little relief hearing this, thanks, although anniversary is a big one haha. Yeah I tell her that my actions speak louder than words, and through my actions I treat her well and show my appreciation, but I guess it'll be awhile until she understands that. Thanks."
1114,isfp,"Ohhh :/ how did that relationship turn out? Yeah, I told her I was sorry and that it's something I will work on, but I guess I'll see how well I do.
I don't know your relationship, but I don't know, if it was shallow for you, as long as you guys got some fun out of it, at least there was something. "
1115,isfp,"He just gets the numbers confused sometimes. He can't remember if my birthday is in August or October but he knows both months are important (one of them is my birth month and the other is our anniversary) so he gets them confused. I swear, he can rattle off Pokemon stats like nothing but he gets dates confused all the time."
1116,isfp,"It was short and kind of messy due to my insecurities getting the better of me.. But I learned a thing or two.
I guess the reason i told you this is because reading your post kind of reminds me of my own experience and i saw ot as a rare opportunity to impart some of my own wisdom to you about something I have learned from a rare personal experience for me.  I want to emphasise again that it's just speculation and i could be wrong about the situation, i just wanted to share my opinion.  And now i'm starting to kind of regret it in case i am right because that would make my telling you this kind of redundant if things end up going down that path..  I just dont want you to make the same mistake as me and be in fake love..  sorry.  
But if you do love her then please ignore this message :)"
1117,isfp,"I'm wondering if there's anyone else out there who consistently has deep conversations with themselves, I do it myself quite a lot. there's a fifty fifty percent chance every night before I fall asleep where I'll have these conversations with myself not about how I did something stupid that day, but like I analyze everyone I interact with lives. like beyond even their interactions with me, I'll think about what they do, why they do it, what they should do (based on my own opinion) to make their lives better. I'll do this with everyone I'll know. I feel like I super analyze everyone's lives,  (and for, I guess, poetic justice) I can't analyze and ""solve"" my own problems. I don't know, I have more to say and could probably say what I've already said, better, but I should end soon. 
also just wanted to say I love you guys,"
1118,isfp,"Yea, i do! In fact there's a constant monologue going on inside my head whenever I'm bored or not occupied. And yes, some or the other kind of analysis about things or people is in process in my mind. Glad to know there are people like me! 
Have a good day!"
1119,isfp,"If I have anything important coming up or happening in my life, I try to set aside time most nights to go on a 1-2 mile walk and talk through them with myself.  I over analyze people all the time and feel like I generally know what's best for them, but I always keep it to myself unless they specifically ask for my opinion on the matter.  Much of my free time is spent thinking about recent interactions I've had with people."
1120,isfp,"YES. All the time. Everything you mentioned. I hyper analyze people and their lives all the time. I often try to guess the motivation behind people's actions based on things I've noticed about them in the past.
 On the contrary I generally tend to avoid having deep conversations with other people, because it never gets to the level of depth I'm use to having with myself.I usually find the conversation almost basic and boring. Maybe I'm not talking to the right people?"
1121,isfp,"So for the past few months we've been training for a tournament for a sport called ""captain ball"". And on our most recent training I had a mental breakdown. I'm the captain of the team and for the past few months I was handling all the stress that comes from being a captain pretty well. It has never passed by limit but I always been so close to exploding due to amount of times I've been hurt emotionally by my teammates not caring or fully relying on me to give them the support or motivation. On that recent training, my girlfriend and I had a heated argument before it and because of that I couldnt get my mind off it during training. I couldn't focus on the game at all and as a team captain, I couldn't do my job to guide my team. I passed my emotionally limit and I exploded (exploded internally :( ofc). I ran off from the field to one far corner behind a bush and I sat their for around 2 hours crying non-stop and couldn't stop but just feel so helpless. I wanted to be alone for as long as I could and I didn't want anyone to see how useless and emotional I was being.
But I really wanted some sort of support, some sort of understanding from my team that the job I've been doing has come with so much sacrifices. I wanted some kind of return or just someone to tell me I did a good job. In the end a few or them messaged me after the training and it did really help make me feel better but not entirely. The fact that only 2 out of 13 really seemed like they cared about how I feel, I start to question myself if this even worth it ? Giving my blood, sweat and tears for people. Just being there for each of them and trying my best to make them feel their best so they can give it their all for each training we have. I feel like I have just been stepped over and been taken advantage of. Doing so much for people that barely care for how I feel and think I'm overreacting. It just feels unfair and worthless. The tournament is in a week and we will have our last training in 2 days. 
How do I go back to them after me being their team captain ran off and left them during training, feeling so demotivated to play the game and just feel confident as the team captain again ? I just don't feel like I'm capable anymore. I feel like just running away from all of this and not face it. The fear of being emotionally hurt again is stopping me from doing it.
‚Äã
Thank you for taking your time and reading. (It means alot)"
1122,isfp,"Hey mate! Firstly I just want to say well done for stepping up to team captain. That‚Äôs hard for anyone to do so give yourself credit for that!
It‚Äôs a bit hard to understand the context of how everyone is behaving etc but I‚Äôll give you what I think might be happening. 
From what you have said it sounds like a pretty reasonable response really so don‚Äôt beat yourself up. With people not contacting you to find out how you were, I‚Äôve been guilty of that too. But not because I didn‚Äôt care but because I thought they probably didn‚Äôt want to hear from me or tell me what was going on so just because they didn‚Äôt message you, don‚Äôt think they didn‚Äôt call. 
Also I think people take it for granted what people in leadership positions do. So don‚Äôt knock yourself around too much. 
Also have you made up with the girlfriend?
As for facing them, I can‚Äôt really tell you what to do as I don‚Äôt know anything about them and very little about you but I think you have 2 options to choose from. Well firstly you should go back. It won‚Äôt be as bad as you think it will. I guarantee they are not thinking about you as much as you think they are. Your choice is really do you want to say something or not. I think the easiest would be just say ‚Äúsorry about last week, I‚Äôve just had a lot going on and trying to captain the team just became too much‚Äù. The other extreme could be addressing that some of the team are undermining you but don‚Äôt do this out of anger and only if you think you should. Ie if it‚Äôs a professional team then you should buy if it‚Äôs a casual thing then probably not. It depends on so much. The other option is just rock up as usual and if someone says something then say the line above or a better version of it. 
I guess the biggest point is it‚Äôs not as big of a deal as you think and I understand that. I‚Äôve been there too. That was the past and the future is what you make it more then you think. 
Anyway I didn‚Äôt want this to go so long and there‚Äôs so much I could say but feel free to pm me if you want. 
Good luck ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1123,isfp,"I have no fucking clue what Captain Ball is, but it sounds like you just need to PLAY some Captain Ball. Not Captain it. Just play it. If you aren't having fun then what the fuck is the point? Try to refigure out why you're there and the emotional stress of Captain might ease up a bit. I realize this whole paragraph can be summarized as just chill the fuck out bro, but really. Just chill the fuck out. Play some Captain Ball. No point being so competitive if you arent even having fun.
Relationship stress is the worst. That attacks you where your'e most vulnerable. I hope the best for you."
1124,isfp,"Letting out a tortured yell, I slammed my foot as hard as I could into the street sign. My shoe became dented. My toes began to ache. The sign stood unflinchingly erect, mocking my vain attempt to turn back time.
A few years ago near a bus stop, I happened to run into a girl that I used to have a massive crush on. I'm fairly certain that she liked me too back then but nothing ever came of it. We met each other at a weekly gathering held near where I lived but we lost touch when the event was no longer being held. My heart skipped a beat when I saw her.
""Molly?"" I asked. She stared at me for a few seconds before a smile started to spread across her face.
""Oh my God, Tomato91!"" She ran over and gave me a huge hug. 
""How have you been?""
""I'm good. How are you?""
""Good, good""
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù
She stared back at me and I suddenly found myself panicking internally. How do I keep the conversation going? What do I say next? Do I make a joke? Should I comment on how she looks? 
Darn it, think Tomato91 think!!
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶the weather‚Äôs pretty nice‚Äù I muttered.
‚ÄúYeah‚Äù she replied.
[The weather? Really Tomato91? Really???]
We stared at each other for a few painful moments, neither of us saying anything and our smiles becoming more and more forced. After what seemed like forever she broke the silence.
""Umm, my bus is here. I need to go.""
She stepped onto the bus and my heart sank as I watched it grow smaller in the distance. I took out my frustration by kicking the street sign as hard as I could, wrecking my foot, and ruining a perfectly good pair of shoes.
I struggled with women for a long time, and up until that point I had been awkward around women for longer than I could remember. This one time stands out in my mind perfectly, though. I had the perfect opportunity to reconnect with a long lost crush and I completely messed it up. If I was ever going to get into a relationship, I realized that I needed to get better at talking to women. My social skills with women needed an overhaul.
Successfully talking to women doesn‚Äôt have to be reserved for those rare people who seem to be born confident or are more extroverted. I‚Äôll show you how to talk and what to say so that you never have to be awkward around women again.
Be Your Best Authentic Self
Okay, raise your hand if any of this describes you:

People ask you ‚Äúwhy are you so quiet?‚Äù like, 10 quadbillion times
You tend to want to leave the party early (or hide in the bathroom) and no one else understands why
You carefully think through what you‚Äôre going to say or do before you do it
You feel tired or want to take a nap after socializing with others for too long.

These are some of the classic character traits that describe introverts. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre the type of person who actually‚Ä¶enjoys‚Ä¶making small talk with strangers then you might be an extrovert. If so, you probably don‚Äôt need to spend your time reading this post. Seriously, r/extrovert is that way. What are you still doing here?
As introverts, we face a lot of pressure to conform to what Susan Cain calls the ‚Äúextrovert ideal‚Äù or the belief that you ought to be ‚Äúgregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight.‚Äù For a long time, I always thought that something was wrong with me because of my introverted qualities and that women would never find me attractive.
After all, one of my friends fits the extrovert ideal almost to a tee. He loves to surround himself with people all the time. When he talks to women, he is very aggressive and makes the conversation explicitly sexual very quickly. On the other hand, I have almost the exact opposite personality; I'm introverted, reserved, and gentle. After watching my friend succeed seemingly all the time while talking to women, I started to become afraid that I would have to drastically change my personality to be more like his if I ever wanted to get a girlfriend.
I tried to behave more like my friend and act more aggressive, more overtly sexual. However, I didn‚Äôt achieve any success even though I was basically doing the same things he was. In addition, I started to feel like I was being an actor by going against my own personality. What was I doing wrong?
As it turns out, the reason was that I wouldn‚Äôt naturally behave that way and women could sense that I was being inauthentic. That‚Äôs the equivalent of biting into a sour lemon and trying to convince someone else that it was the best thing you‚Äôve ever tasted
Yes, there are a lot of women who enjoy his renegade Han Solo-esque personality and would turn me down because I was too quiet. However, there are also many women who take a liking to the charming introvert and who would never go for someone like my friend.
I found myself succeeding when I behaved authentically. When talking to women, you should be your best authentic self. In other words, you should be the version of yourself that your friends and loved ones enjoy being around.
How do you behave around the people you are comfortable with and what is it that they like about you? Are you bubbly and energetic? Perceptive and down to earth? A renegade and aggressive? Or maybe you‚Äôre more of a quiet listener? When talking to women, that‚Äôs the side of you that you want to display. By being your best authentic self, you‚Äôll attract women who would be a good match for you while helping to ward off the ones that might not work out so well.
As for what to actually say to her, you should‚Ä¶
Talk to her about what she‚Äôs interested in (and listen to what she says)
A while ago, I was at a gaming meetup which was held weekly near my place and I met this cute, quiet girl wearing a pair of glasses. After I introduced myself to her (‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Tomato91‚Äù) she told me her name (‚ÄúI‚Äôm Molly‚Äù) and she started by admitting that she was somewhat of a quiet person and that she hoped I didn‚Äôt mind.
‚ÄúOh, good‚Äù I thought to myself, ‚Äúbecause I sort of am too.‚Äù
To my surprise, we ended up talking for almost an hour! She told me all about how excited she was to see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World‚Äôs End when it was in theaters and how she enjoys playing as Yoshi and how she was anxiously waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out. She explained how she was trying to create her own RPG computer game.
All of that from a self-proclaimed quiet girl.
As Dale Carnegie wrote in his book How to Win Friends and Influence People, becoming a good conversationalist involves talking in terms of the other person‚Äôs interests and listening to them when they talk about themselves. Doing this sends the message that you‚Äôre interested in her values, attitudes, experiences, and beliefs. You‚Äôre interested in who she is as a person.
So, try to find something that she would be interested to tell you about herself. A great way to do this is by asking open-ended or ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù questions. When she tells you something about herself, listen to what she has to say. Then, ask some follow-up questions based on what she just told you or relate it to yourself (as I explain in the next section).
If she suddenly changes the subject during your conversation, typically it will be to something that she is interested in telling you about. Ask her to tell you more! 
Talk about the things that make you interesting
If she is interested in you, then she would probably like to learn more about you too! Just like how we looked for things that she would love to tell you about herself, she will be looking to talk to you about the things that get you excited.
Does she ask you open-ended questions about yourself? This basically means ‚ÄúI want to learn more about you.‚Äù Tell her about some of the things that make you an interesting person. Do you have an awesome job? An adventurous story? Read something unusual recently? If she asks you what your job or hobby is and you happen to do something cool, talk to her about it!
As a bonus, try to find something that the both of you are passionate about or have in common. Do you both like Katy Perry? Hate Justin Bieber? Loved the new Star Wars? Have the same hobby? One of my friends is a huge bookworm and reads 3-5 books a week. When he met his girlfriend for the first time, he discovered that she also really enjoyed reading. They spent a long time talking about the stories they read and trying to convince the other person to read their favorite book.
However, just make sure that she is actually interested in what you‚Äôre telling her about yourself. Several times I found myself talking to a ‚Äúme-monster‚Äù who dominated the conversation by talking about themselves and left me feeling bored. Pay attention to her body language. Is she hanging on to your every word? Or is she unenthusiastically listening to you talk about yourself? If she is zoning out, change the subject or let her get a word in.
Being Successful Talking to Women
Looking back, there are about a million different ways I could have handled it better when I ran into Molly at the bus stop. I could have asked her where she was taking the bus to (or where she was taking it from). I could have asked her if she ever finished that game she was trying to make, or if she ever got around to reading the latest Harry Potter. 
Better yet, I could have asked her out years ago when the weekly gatherings that I met her at were still being held.
I never spoke to her again after that incident. Recently, I saw her Facebook profile and she‚Äôs in a relationship with a great guy. At least, I think he‚Äôs a great guy. I guess I‚Äôm happy for her and I‚Äôd like to think that she‚Äôs happy for me too. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know if she even still remembers me anymore. I want to imagine she does.
Being able to talk to women is something we can all get better at no matter how awkward or uncomfortable we may feel. I can tell you from experience that it sucks missing out just because you don‚Äôt know how to talk to her. And I don‚Äôt want that to happen to you.

1125,isfp,"I'm kinda sad that i found this today. After I started smoking weed and relax a little, almost all of these points came to me naturally :D
but fuck it, ill save this if I'm starting to lose my grip on reality :P"
1126,isfp,"This post would be much better suited for a non mbti personality forum. The introvert you described is explicitly NOT the way an introvert is to be described in MBTI. It's just wrong that you are generalizing introverts as shy and afraid of women. Why that might be the case in other theories, in mbti, introvert simply means your primary function is inwardly focused.
I mean advising isfp's to be genuine.. .... .. desiring to be genuine is a hallmark of ISFP's. You don't need to advise me to be what I already am. Maybe we have trouble with girls, but this sort of advise is better oriented toward the general population of shy people, not introverts.
I would appreciate if you deleted the post or made an edit acknowledging this fact."
1127,isfp,"I like a guy with black or dark brown hair that is a little shaggy, brown or black eyes, and facial hair. A guy looks more laid-back when he doesn't cut his hair too punctually or shave too often, and I definitely need someone relaxed.
I like it if his eyes crinkle or squint when he smiles/laughs. So sweet.
For some reason I am intrigued by tired-looking eyes, I think they hint at some kind of tortured soul that I could relate to :p
I'm a girl with blonde hair, maybe that's why I find dark hair and eyes so magnetic."
1128,isfp,"It‚Äôs weird, none of the guys I like really look the same or have the same personality, but I definitely have a type, I just don‚Äôt know how to explain it. Usually I see someone‚Äôs eyes first- not like what color they are or whatever- but I swear one of the best feelings is when you look at a guy you think is attractive, and they‚Äôre already staring at you with this look and then they immediately look down or away. They look like lost puppies and I just want to go hug them lol. Also, HAIR! A guy could be pretty ugly in the facial region, but have nice hair and be super hot, it‚Äôs insane. For body stuff, it kind of varies. I don‚Äôt pay a whole lot of attention to height (because I‚Äôm fairly tall myself at 5‚Äô8‚Äù so a lot of guys are about the same height as me) but at the same time, it‚Äôs definitely a bonus when they‚Äôre taller than me, mostly because it makes me feel a little more feminine since I‚Äôm constantly taller than others. 
I also love when guys dress nicely. They don‚Äôt have to wear suits or anything like that daily, but even something like wearing their own kind of uniform (like a black or white T-shirt with jeans and vans or something) is really attractive, just because it makes it seem like they kind of have their life together lol. Basically, when they dress in their own way instead of just dressing to be trendy. This guy I know where‚Äôs pink shirts or black sweaters with floral print on the shoulders, and still manages to pull it off. Idk, there‚Äôs lots of little attractive things, and honestly, I could go on lol."
1129,isfp,"Mmm, not necessarily. I just tend to like guys who are confident with others but shy when it comes to crushes. It‚Äôs kind of obnoxious when a guy likes you so he treats it like some kind of prize he needs to win..."
1130,isfp,"That's the question I ask myself every day. On one hand I want to rock the world. I have tools to do it (software developer). But every time I try... I ask myself, why would I do it? Why? For what? And then I want to just sell everything. Run away and eat potatoes that I farmed myself..."
1131,isfp,"Relaxation. If I was a high stress person who was very busy all of the time, constantly planning and having a million things on my schedule every day I would go bananas. Seems like a lot of people thrive when they are always busy. Not me. If I don't have time to chill out I cannot function."
1132,isfp,"This is a tough question to answer. I guess I would have to say hope. Hope for the future, hope that I will turn out a better person, that my life is worth something and I can actually make a difference in this world. For that matter, faith. Faith is important to me, too. "
1133,isfp,"INTx types are my type, apparently, as pretty much every dude I've been very attracted to has been one. My current boyfriend is an INTP. I have dated INTJ's in the past but I don't think I could ever be in a serious relationship with one. I am a hardcore P type and J types in general are just way too structured for me (and conversely my lack of organization and planning would probably be really annoying to them). I like the NT combo though, I feel like they help round me out and get me to think about things more holistically."

1135,isfp,"Hello friends. I'm someone who doesn't think and gets caught up in the moment. Then afterwards, the logic slowly creeps in retrospectively and it can reappear for months at an end, similar to post-traumatic stress disorder with flashbacks and anxiety. I then get depressed and ruminate and it's a very painful cycle that's gone on for years. I've been to see a psychiatrist who said I suffer from mild depression and ruled out bipolar. Is it an ISFP to act first and think later (I've read that rumination is a thing), or could this doctor be wrong?
I read as much as I can about psychology and then forget it. It's exhausting trying to live without bad feelings that gnaw at your brain...
Thanks for reading x"
1136,isfp,"understanding your cognitive functions is essential to this problem.
the ISFP's primary function is Introverted Feeling (Fi), which seeks to make an impact on the world around us, and to express ourselves through our morals and beliefs. at times, the Fi dominant user can appear to behaving selfishly or emotionally, but this may not always be the case. Fi is a nebulous and sometimes misleading function, because it depends so much on the individual's feelings. this pairs with the auxiliary function, Extroverted Sensing, which is attracted to following impulses and enjoying action in the present moment, creating new experiences to add to its pool of information to reference later. when these two wild and potentially unstable forces combine, beautiful works of art, music, dance, etc. can be created...or, we might get caught up in the moment and say or do things we later regret. this is where the tertiary and inferior functions cause the ISFP to tear himself to pieces for long after the fact. the tertiary function, Introverted Intuiting (Ni), sorts out abstract information into the user's internal map or framework of how things work. Ni users remember the essence of a situation and how the world might perceive those words and actions. as a tertiary function, it is still a strong psychological force, but the ISFP is less aware of its influence on his thinking. this is important in its relation to the inferior function, Extraverted Thinking (Te). Te is often repressed in ISFP's and INFP's because it is very rigid, dealing with organizing and empirical thinking. it may manifest in stressful situations by making a detailed critique of the specifics, excessive cleaning or organizing, focusing strongly on exactly what was said or done. 
The cycle you are describing: Te sorts through Ni's memory of a situation, which is full of rich details pertaining to decisions made in the heat of an exciting moment, and criticizes the living shit out of those memories. The moment is too far gone for anything to actually be done about it, but these strong feelings are there, so Fi and Ni struggle to deal with and understand this new wave of questions be posed to them: why did i say that? why did i act that way? why would i have done something so clearly foolish? and so on. i've been through this cycle a million times, and honestly the best thing you can do for yourself is understand these functions better, develop Se and Te, maintain awareness of Ni and Fi. hope this helps."
1137,isfp,"Have you ever considered you've been mistyped? The way you describe your cycle makes me think you're Fi inferior not Fi primary. Using Fi and obsessing over it causes you stress and makes you uncomfortable.
Personally I'm comfortable with the bounds of my Fi and know when to stop because it's my dominant function.
I would like to say you're an intj if it fits. Or istj considering how past focused the process is described.
However, I can see why an ISFP with underdeveloped Fi would be depressed."
1138,isfp,"Hi Fingersticks, thank you so much for this reply, I've been thinking about it all night. It makes so much sense from what you've described. When I was 18-20, I did everything thinking 'hey why not'. And it wasn't until someone judged me with a horrible name that I saw it all clearly - then depressive hell broke loose. Over 10 years later and I'm still beating myself over it, analysing, revising. Overthinking has driven me insane. I sit in work and my mind wanders and I'm back there again as if it was yesterday. I even feel somehow 'wrong' for revealing this right now. I now use psychology and books as a way of understanding but... Given half the chance I'd probably do it again. I go round in circles of judgements, anger, sadness and then 'Oh f**k it, life's too short'.
How do you get joy from life Fingersticks? Are you creative and artistic? Thanks for sharing :) x"
1139,isfp,"Hi MrManicMan, thanks for sharing. Tell me more about your experiences, I love talking to other ISFPs. I still question things I did over a decade ago. I think pick apart at them, these things can't be put to rest. And does it stop me from repeating them? No :/ I get highs and then mind-numbing weeks of depression... The psychiatrist said that it was 'mild', I thought 'there's no way that can be mild'. Now I'm wondering if it's so self-induced coming from my ISFP brain, that it's almost like accepting the colour of my eyes - it won't change. That it just is how it is. Hug x"
1140,isfp,"Oh no, I hope not :( I am definitely not strategic enough to be a TJ. But do you think it's possible to be an  unhealthy ISFP suffering with something clinical? Recently I've been under a lot of stress and living with an ESTJ who has made me think like him (against my natural state). When I lived on my own, I was wild and free. Now I feel I have to worry about judgement because of my repressive strict partner. Could it be something external affecting me? I can't tell anymore :/"
1141,isfp,"Glad to hear it!  Its very important to direct that mental energy into creative activities: writing stories, poems, drawing, painting, sculpting, playing an instrument, singing, dancing, boxing, grappling, etc...I find that if I go too long without being creative my mind will find something else to chew on, and it's usually past experiences, and that is always agonizing. There are some really good articles out there about tertiary Ni and inferior Te, those functions are at the heart of what you're describing. Best of luck."
1142,isfp,"I too over analyze things I did years ago, and I luckily somehow deal with it very well. there were a couple times in my life where I was really depressed but had no one to talk to or anyone that would understand, I would hold my anger well sometimes but other times take my anger out in small acts towards anyone. I would yell and scream stuff like that, I don't know how but I've gotten over it. 
as an over analyzer I think I've come to the point where I can say to myself, that the things that are in the past have stayed on the past (things that are years old) and I don't have to worry about them, but I still worry about stupid things I've done or said withing the recent past. I guess I get over it slightly by just laughing at myself, obviously this doesn't work for everything but most of the minor stuff it does. I'm sorry that depression is something you have to experience, I don't really know what the is left to say, but I hope it gets better, takes some rest time do the stuff you enjoy and enjoy life, fight through the bad times so you can enjoy the good"
1143,isfp,"Having your personality distorted by others makes it much harder to be typed however you talk like an isfx. Ya you could definitely be an isfp!! I just thought I'd mention it because it's not uncommon for people to be mistyped. And that doesn't seem like a very healthy relationship to me sea horse. I certainly need a ton of freedom in plans and in lifestyle choice to be comfortable, fortunately my partner goes out of her way to give me that. But fighting for it isnt something that comes naturally to many isfps. I'd try typing out how you feel about it. Don't need to send it, but it will probably make you feel more validated and help you find the right words to express yourself with. Not that you need some random on the internet giving you advice."
1144,isfp,"I've been looking at threads here, and in all the ones about music, not many old school rock and blues songs have been posted.
I fucking love thus kind if music and I really don't know why. So I'm just wondering if any other ISFPs here love rock. Not alternative, not metal, not punk, ROCK."
1145,isfp,"I love all kinds of music, and all the music is for different moods. Classic Rock hits me when I'm in a really good mood and I just want to jam out. I've probably listened to classic rock more than any other genre of music."
1146,isfp,"You gotta be more specific. You said not punk or alternative, but those ARE rock. Punk rock. Alternative rock.
Do you mean classic rock? Hard rock? Rock'n'roll? Pop-rock? Piano rock?
Your question comes off like ""Who likes the color pink? Not rose or fuchsia, but pink?"" Which makes no sense because those are both shades of pink.
That being said, I like MOST music. There's very little music I actively dislike. Most music falls anywhere on the spectrum from indifferent to love. Most types of rock I tend to enjoy. I often dislike the way classic rock vocalists sing, but I like the music...so I hardly listen to it on my own, but I generally don't mind if it's on (depending on the band and how annoying the vocals are). Hard rock, again I enjoy but don't often listen to of my own choice, but it's higher up there. Punk is hit or miss. I tend to like poppier punk...otherwise it's just a lot of yelling and wailing on instruments.
I tend to absolutely love alternative rock and pop-rock. And pop music in general. (What can I say, I like fun, feel good music and can appreciate simple, uncomplicated things.)
I really do need to listen to more blues. And funk."
1147,isfp,"As an ISFP, my tastes shift pretty often. I think I can relate to having a keen sense of what is/isn't part of a genre or subgenre. That said, ""rock"" is an umbrella term, so you'll have to be more specific. What bands do you like? If you're on Spotify, check the ""Related Artists"" tab. Also, you might have better luck in a music subreddit since this sub is devoted to the ISFP Myers-Briggs personality type."
1148,isfp,"I mainly listen to electronic, hiphop, and rock/metal music, but I don't really listen to rock that often anymore. Now it's usually one rock/metal song to 10 electronic/hiphop songs or something. I think it just usually requires a different mood for me"
1149,isfp,"im similar to you in that my musical tastes are all over the place. i have:
100.7 hours of rock
13.6 hours of electronic
365 hours of hip hop
4.6 hours of jazz/blues
42 hours of metal
9 hours of trip hop"
1150,isfp,"In the next two weeks or so I will be dealing with really high levels of stress and anxiety brought on by tons of school related stuff I gotta do. It's really hard to keep myself from shutting down and turning into an emotional mess, and because I am so busy as it is I barely see my friends and family, and when I do I feel guilty because that is time I could be using to get stuff done. Any ideas or tips on how to get through this really hard period in my life?  "
1151,isfp,"INTJ here.
First off, sorry to hear that. Your situation sounds extremely stressful and honestly, you're having a totally normal reaction to this. 
Now, here's what I'd suggest.
1.] Prioritize. Sit down and think about what you need to do and when you need to do it. Grab a piece of paper and write out a list, with the most urgent task at the top and the least urgent task at the bottom. 
2.] Tell your family and friends that you are going to be unavailable for the next two weeks. They should understand and respect that. It'll also help you feel less guilty about not spending enough time with them. 
3.] Work in blocks. For example, let's say that you're writing a paper. After an hour and a half of writing, you take a thirty minute break. You can, of course, work for longer or shorter stretches of time and your breaks can be as long as you want. 
4.] Sleep. I know that sleep might seem like something you can take a bit of time away from, but trust me; inadequate sleep will make everything seem much worse. Most people need eight hours of sleep every night, but that number usually ranges from seven to nine depending on the person. You should also try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. For example, you could try to go to bed at ten and wake up at six. Avoid using electronics and keep away from bright and/or 'cool' lights a few hours before bedtime; the wavelengths of light those items emit can interfere with your body's production of sleeping hormones. If you can't fall asleep because of how stressed you are, I'd suggest considering an over-the-counter sleep aid. Low dose melatonin is usually effective and rarely causes grogginess the next day, but it takes an hour or two before it starts working and the quality of melatonin supplements is highly variable. If you are more willing to take a gamble, I'd suggest using diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom). I've never tried doxylamine, but I know diphenhydramine knocks me the fuck out within thirty minutes of taking it. In addition, diphenhydramine is dirt cheap and can be purchased in most grocery, convenience, or general stores. Unfortunately, diphenhydramine and doxylamine are more likely than melatonin to cause drowsiness the next day; in addition, doxylamine and diphenhydramine are more likely to cause side effects than melatonin is and they may loose their effectiveness after a few days. 
5.] Be mindful of caffeine. In small amounts, caffeine is an amazing tool. Moderate doses of caffeine can help increase your attention span, energy levels, and overall motivation. That being said, caffeine needs to be used wisely. Too much caffeine can make it hard to focus or to sit still. You should also be aware that caffeine's half life is five to six hours. Let's say that you take a 200 mg caffeine tablet at 10:00 am. By 3:00 pm or 4:00 pm, 100 mg of caffeine will remain in your system. 
6.] Remember to eat -- and eat well! I know that you might not have the time to make yourself three solid meals a day, but prepackaged and canned foods are simple, fast, and surprisingly decent. They're nothing to write home about, but they'll get you through. And don't forget: a little bit of chocolate can be very helpful. It turns out that the brain burns glucose as fuel, so a little extra sugar in your diet would actually be beneficial. 
7.] Get up and move. I'm not saying that you have the time or the desire to go to the gym, but even taking a half-hour walk every day can be an immensely effective way of countering the physical and psychological effects of stress. 
8.] Laugh a little! I know this is fairly obvious, but laughter is one of the best ways to reduce stress. Do you have a funny TV show you enjoy watching? Why not watch that when you're taking a break? 
9.] Plan a few steps ahead and reduce inefficiencies. If you take ten minutes to lay out the clothes you'll wear tomorrow and to figure out what you'll eat, the amount of time you'll save is rather substantial. Forcing yourself to take short showers (no more than six minutes) and forgoing extraneous  grooming activities (like using a hairdryer) will definitely save you a shitload of time. 
Again, I'm sorry you have to go through this garbage. If its any consolation, though, at least this shit will be over with in two weeks. 
I know it's difficult, but keep your chin up. Things will get better soon. "
1152,isfp,"If you like to draw or make art of some kind, I'd suggest that. Immersive activities like painting, reading something I really like always help me deal with moments of high stress. It's good to be able to turn your brain off and have singular focus on something."
1153,isfp,"If your schoolwork doesn't involve heavy brain-crunching, I'd suggest playing music that you find relaxing or are familiar with in the background. Since it won't be very distracting, you can pay attention to your work. Whenever your mind wanders, you'll pay attention to the music and get to rest a little before getting back to work.
Self-care is definitely important, so remember to do that too!"
1154,isfp,"See, I think that's the kind of attitude I would've agreed with a while ago, but. Well. School work is important, at least to me, and I know that if I just tough it out for these two weeks I'll be fine. I don't know how I can manage my stress properly, but I know that if I can find some decent techniques I can do it. 
Experience has taught me that schoolwork is a necessary evil. It's not very nice, but at least it won't take forever "
1155,isfp,"I dont think its abnormal, clearly he has been hurt and now he is hesitant to do something due to the indecent with the other guy. I guess you have to lure him back with sometging that shows him you care. A bit like luring a cat. First thing that came to my mind was for you to physically go to him. Idk how he works and if he is busy and all. Don't force things.
Another part of me says to leave it. Dont feel sorry for him. I guess that's worse, as in he needs to be able to deal with his insecurities. But if you are interested in him and the relationship then carry on. I know it seems harsh but you will actually be helping him in a way. 
I know I have worded this weird. Hopefully it gets through as intentded. "
1156,isfp,"My first time being hurt I was like this too. It was during my highschool years so my recovery/healing time went alongside me gaining maturity from teen to adult so it was less painless. Anyway here's how ISFP's work, at least for me. If we aren't in a relationship, we crave to be so much. The second we find one, we tend to cling very strongly to our SO. Our relationships depend on trust and the second that trust is broken even the slightest, you're fucked. It takes a lot of time for me especially to accept you back to my good side. If you see a sad ISFP let them know you care. The easiest way to get to our hearts is too love the fuck out of us. Not too much, but back rubs aplenty we love being loved. If anyone tries to break up our relationship by taking our SO's away or for themselves, we either have the balls to fight to the death for you or we don't and we become depressed as fuck. We rely on trust because we love feeling that sense of importance and meaning from others. That feeling especially is what drives me, the ""I can make anyone happy and make a difference in the world"" feeling. If I were you I would evaluate what you want in a relationship and how much you like this ISFP. He's going to take some time to heal and he's definitely going to take more time to be understood by his SO. Nothing's worse than a relationship where two people don't understand how their SO's think. If you want to be with this person you have to be devoted and see him more often."
1157,isfp,"He sounds emotionally unavailable.
This would be a red flag for me if I heard this from a girl on the first night ""you won't leave me will you?"". It signifies a potential  neediness and a broken self-esteem to mewhich is always a slow-drip disaster over time. 
Although I don't know a ton about MBTI (I'm an ISFP male) For me, I have to ""allow"" someone to get close to me before It'll go any deeper. I hate it, honestly. Very few people, let alone relationship targets, ever get that far. shrug.. I know very few ES, but they do have a way of unlocking that barrier at a faster rate.  My daughter is an 18-year old ESFP and she's the closest person to me. Not just because she's my daughter. 
If I let a person close then you're in, but if I get betrayed then it's that much worse. I shut-down, and become unavailable for anyone. After 2 EN's burned me, I'm not sure I can connect to anyone anymore. I have interested attractive options(not bragging), but I just am unable to connect. I stopped dating as a result because it's not fair to me or anyone else until I feel I can. 
As far as the other person, depending on what happened I'd definitly withdraw some. I'd think I was another option possibly. But like I said, it depends on what happened, how it was portrayed, and how your actions lined up versus the ""story"". Being open and reassuring will help, but I know in each case I've been burned there was a situation early on in the relationship that should have been taken as a red flag along certain ""just a friend"" lines, so I'm much more likely to withdraw depending on the situation. 
He just might not be that interested? I'm indifferent for the most part unless I'm in to someone... "
1158,isfp,I don't really think this is a type thing...he just sounds reaaaallly not ready for relationship.  I think it's in your best interest not to try to fix him.  The dude has some issues and he needs to be responsible to sort them out himself.
1159,isfp,Ok I'm really trying man. I sent him a playlist I made. I'm drawing him a picture. I tell him how cute he is and shit. But yeah I can't be playing this game forever. I know I'm helping him which is why I wanna stay. I don't think any other girl would help him thru this.
1160,isfp,"Lol I've definitely been doing that, I'm surprised he hasn't told me to fuck off already out of annoyance
This was really insightful. I really wanna see him more. He's just either busy or I am and stuff hasn't lined up right."
1161,isfp,"hmm. Ive been thinking of this for a while now and I still am not sure how to word it. It isnt your or any other girls job to help him through this. You clearly care about him and dont want him to go through this, but you can only lead the horse to the water. You can always just keep an open mind, stop messaging him and wait for him to come to you. It wont be your loss but his. And then when he comes back have a different kind of relationship. "
1162,isfp,Yeah I can't help him. He isn't ready he was literally looking for reasons to push me away and found one. He did everything he could to stay emotionally uninvested his trust issues are so hardcore. He's beyond help at this point
1163,isfp,"They're kind of a morbid obsession of mine, generally I really dislike them, but I'm also very intrigued by them at the same time. Kinda like how a villain in a game or anime usually takes most of my attention.
But anyways, I generally find them rather odd. They kind of feel like real people acting like characters from fiction, just not.. real.
First off there's that childlike and playful vibe they have, kinda like an ENFP, but with a very mean bite behind it all. Kinda like how in some media there are villains that act cutesy, cheery and bubbly, but deep within they're just thinking of ways to kill and torture as many people as possible. It's almost like they're some sort of evil robot that's disguised as a teddy bear.
What also really mystifies me is how they tend to be so well-liked by others. I mean, they say pretty much everything that comes up in their heads, whether or not it's appropriate. Heck, as far as I can tell they enjoy it even more if someone does get offended. It's almost like only ISFPs can see their ""real form"", whereas they wear a disguise that makes them seem acceptable to other people.
Their lack of Fi is also really weird to me. Then again, as a Fi dom I guess that's natural, but I don't really seem to notice this all that much in ESTPs. ENTPs are pretty much the Anti-Fi. We can talk about this all we want, but I guess this is just something I will never get, so whatever.
Also, something I find really funny is that I tend to share interests with ENTPs a lot, even though as people we couldn't be more different.
Buuuuuut I've also seen a couple of ENTPs that just act rather formal and don't really try to step on your toes. I guess those are the more mature ones? They seem alright."
1164,isfp,"They can be very harsh, but that's their nature. They'll value facts over feelings and I think that's okay, that's how I make decisions although it hurts. But I would never date an ENTP. As a friend they sound really nice to talk to, though."
1165,isfp,"I dated an ENTP for 4 years! It was a healthy and fulfilling relationship for the most part. He is still one of my best friends who I love unconditionally and see weekly. I‚Äôm really glad we are not dating though because we were very different and towards the end I think I was bringing him down. 
I think ENTPs get a bad rep because emotionally immature or unhealthy ENTPs are insufferable. But ones with more developed Fe are wonderful and creative and dynamic! They do talk a lot. Living with one was a lot of noise.
I see why ISFPs wouldn‚Äôt get along with ENTPs but I also think we align on a few things. For example we both loved novelty and experiencing new things so we travelled really well together. I liked all the sensory experiences and he liked the ideas and inspiration from the novelty. We lived well enough together but he needs to go out with friends constantly and I have to balance nights with people and nights alone. We both liked science fiction movies and the idea of time travel. I got him into politics and he ended up getting so into understanding political systems and taught me a lot and helped me broaden my understanding. 
I think we naturally clash with ENTPs but I think people can form a healthy relationship with any type, if both people are mature enough. "
1166,isfp,I was in a majorly unhealthy relationship with one for a few years. I was completely obsessed and they were constantly reeling me in and then ignoring me for days. I think they liked how willing I was to direct all of my attention toward them and I was fascinated by how creative yet detached from the world they were. It was awful- do not recommend hahah
1167,isfp,"My brother is an ENTP lol He has his moments of being extremely dislikable, but he also has extremely sweet moments. In my hyper moments we both talk a lot, go in adventures, or watch tv. I just know that wecan't spend too much time around together or we'll get into in argument. Hanging with him once a week is about as much as I can take since we have such different outlooks on life, but I love him."
1168,isfp,"Yes, we can see right through them, and they're so fucking rude. The guy I know acts like he's in the mafia after he watches too many gangster movies. When I first met him, I fucking hated him, but now I pretty much fuckin love him. We have a lot in common, he's just more extraverted, and that's really fun, and takes me out of my shell! At first glance, he seems really pretentious, but I mean, we are too, just on the inside. And he's so loyal, he will fucking defend me until the end when he thinks someone is messing with me or giving me a hard time. If he was a girl, I'd kiss him. Yeah I think he's just playful and doesn't take life too seriously so he acts however and says whatever he wants, which is I think how we all wanna be, right?"
1169,isfp,"I have an ISFP family member who is married to an ISTJ. The ISTJ ALWAYS decides what to do, shouts orders, and just generally bosses the ISFP around. I'll set something up for the ISFP like some Youtube clips on my laptop and the ISTJ will say, ""C'MON, LET'S GO"" and that's it--they have to leave. All of our family members know about this.
I was thinking, ""this person is a mature human (70+ years old), it's sad but not my place to intervene."" 
Then, recently, a friend who's an art analyst analyzed some of this ISFP's art (just casually, without them knowing) while we were dining together. She doesn't know ISFP personally, but said, ""you know, while it's beautiful--there's a lot of anger in this work.""
It's not like there are slashes in the canvas here--so I was jolted out of my friendship slumber. But I totally see it now. This person is definitely angry inside, and heck, I would be too.
What can I do to help? I know some people like to have relationship problems to chew on, but IDK, this has more of a ""I'd rather intervene than see this person die being bossed around"" feeling of it within my heart.
Ideas? It's not a chatty relationship for us at all so I'm wondering if there are actions or specific things I can do to help make it better. Not looking to break up a relationship so much as help this person feel happy. Thanks!"
1170,isfp,"Thanks, I'll do my best but that will be like pulling off a bank heist or something. His friends talk about ""secret tricks to make him talk"" and things like that. lol. When I talk to him, I can only tell that he feels comfortable talking about external objects. Paintings, landscapes, etc."
1171,isfp,"I have a best friend that is an INFJ (well I consider him as a best friend, maybe not for him)
So I do love INFJs, I think they are amazing.
I have recently fallen hard for an INFJ. Wanted to know what you guys experienced?
Male ISFP female INFJ"
1172,isfp,"Kinda. I also fell veryyy hard for one. Was perfect for a few weeks, then fell to pieces. Which seems to be a trend with all INFJs I‚Äôve met. She withdrew one day and that was that. Hurt a fuck ton. I still blame myself, but she just couldn't quite decide what she wanted; and I didn't quite know how to handle that. I still think they're amazing, though the two types just don't seem to work. But that's my experience - don't let it put you off! Good luck to you! 
‚Äã"
1173,isfp,"It‚Äôs probably not the type of relationship you‚Äôre talking about, but my sister is INFJ, and she‚Äôs one of the people I‚Äôm (ISFP) absolutely closest to. Even though things that are analytical and philosophical make my hair stand on end, we still have amazing conversations. It‚Äôs like are conversations meet in the middle; mine get a little deeper and hers get a little less deep. We talk more about life (real events, more Sensor style), and how we feel about them (more Intuitive style), without having to delve deep into them. We seem to be very balanced that way, and we can talk for hours. I can share things with her that I‚Äôm reluctant to share with even others I‚Äôm close to, and because of her personality type, I know that anything I tell her is safe with her, and I also know that she will be very gentle and even try hard to understand my point of view, and it‚Äôs easy to follow her lead that way. INFJs are great. "
1174,isfp,"I have an INFJ friend. While he is an amazing person and really considerate of others, I find that he's very guarded and doesn't open up much. This makes our friendship very unfufilling. He seems to have really high standards for people and recently, I've accidentally stepped on his tail. I feel like he is avoiding me and our friendship feels kind of tiring :/"
1175,isfp,"Hi, 
I stumbled across this and just wanted to say that I am INFJ (25F) and my partner is ISFP (25M). We previously thought he was INFP and just realised today he's ISFP and the description is a lot more fitting. We have the most complementary relationship and it's fulfilling and full of so much love, care, kindness and passion. Due to both of our sensitivities towards other people's feelings we are so considerate and in tune with each other's emotions and empathetic af. It helps that a lot of our interests over lap, so we can comfortably do things together quietly or laugh about them and discuss them passionately. We are both very justice/rights driven and I've never met another person I've been able to connect with in this way in terms of valuing the same human rights issues in society. I definitely am more of the talker in terms of everyday conversing and random musings, but he is such a great listener and he always has interesting, funny, insightful things to add. 
I can definitely see the one main '''issue''' being how I'm so persistent on us planning for future (we've been in a 2 year mostly LDR with huge financial/career, familial, and logistical difficulties standing in our way of closing the gap), and he is a bit more like 'everything will be okay' 'we'll take it one day at a time', but the problem is it won't be okay if we don't take concrete steps because it's not easy at all (I have a 'bad' passport meaning it's so difficult for me to go places.. whereas he is from a Western country so it's a lot easier). This also frustrates me because I am the more career driven one (not a good or bad thing) and due to life struggles he is still struggling to get on his feet in a career that suits him. So this all factors in... but I would say that's the only thing we really 'argue' about like, money and our future, though he is super passionate about building a relationship and future with me and wants to marry me but at the same time finds it hard taking the necessary planning steps to actualise it. And I think that's where I need too hone in my Judging-ness because I really hate to hurt his feelings when I'm just trying to see the most 'practical' steps to take to make his life better in the long run (regarding career struggles), whereas he isn't comfortable with thinking of how to plan ahead. But for me it's all I've ever known to do... 
But the SAME trait that makes us quarrel over future and career stuff is actually one of the best part of our relationship (him being more laid back and me being more I guess uptight). I live in a city that's sooooo study-focused, fast-paced, career driven, and as an INFJ that also wears me down quite a lot. It makes me feel like if I'm not doing something all the time, I'm useless, and my mind is always running like 1000mph and I constantly feel as though I'm not good enough as compared to my peers. My ISFP helps me slow down, enjoy the now, and breathe, and realise that I am enough. I've never had anyone do that for me before and I cherish every moment I have with him whether it's coming home to our daily Skype call or the rare occasion that we get to be together in person. 
I love our relationship and I've never been able to connect with anyone the way I connect with him, and vice versa. I love his mind, his heart, his soul, and everything about him, and he's the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. 
Anyway, sorry this got long but I hope it helps in some way? :)"
1176,isfp,"Holy moly. This is so accurate!!! It really resonated and man, it's good to know I'm not alone. The difference in actualising plans, the INFP mistype, the deep connection, all of it! 
Lately my INFJ Fe versus his Fi has been a point of conflict (or avoidance thereof). I neeeed to talk and he hates it. 
PS I moved to the country to escape the rat race. Did my mind a world of good :)"
1177,isfp,"Well, he gradually stopped responding to my texts, or sent me one word replies and when I tried to talk to him about it he said he couldn't keep up anymore (we were in a LDR). Then there was a period of silence (I didn't want to bother him because he said he was stressing himself out) and then he made a post declaring himself single on Facebook üôÉ
It really sucked for me though, because we were having an absolutely fantastic time before that. I'm in terms with it now because I actually enjoy being single"
1178,isfp,"Reading this made me smile!!! So incredible to find likeminded people! I can definitely understand the Fe Fi 'conflict'. I definitely talk sooo much and I always feel like a few years down the line he'll be like more 'are you done' than 'heart eyes I love listening to you' but ahhh. He seems to never tire of it haha :D 
OMG! That is goals!!! I honestly feel burnt out already at 25 I can't imagine like 40 more years of this city lifestyle haha."
1179,isfp,"I guess something switched in him, he didn't want keep being in a LDR, and I guess he had some self-love issues and overall stress in life
edit: as for how long we were together, I can't remember it outright but it was less than a year."
1180,isfp,"Which general region of your country do you live in? I used to live in the midwest and the colors sucked, but in the east they are breathtaking.
Comfy clothes are always a justified option in my life..."
1181,isfp,I've always wanted to go forging! Last backpacking trip I did a few weeks ago there were all sorts of mushrooms. I need someone to help point out the edible ones because I had no idea what I was looking at. 
1182,isfp,Yup. I have loooaads of stuff backed up that i need to do and yet day after day i continue to do none of it. Still waiting for the sense of urgency to come and motivate me to work but its been several weeks now and it hasnt come.
1183,isfp,"For me, some of my better friends have been with all the SP types, and I have made good friendships with ISTJ and INTP personalities. I don't care much for ESFJ types, and have never been interested in making friends with anyone so far from the NF category. What about you guys? "
1184,isfp,"In my experience as an INFP I don't gel with ESFPs, ISTPs, or ESTPs but I love ISFPs. You all are my favorite out of the S types (ISFJs are a close second) and I usually only gel with N types. I see some ISFPs as perfect conductors of a symphony orchestra and all ISFPs as incredibly free spirits. "
1185,isfp,"Almost all introverted types, really. I prefer feelers and intuitives, but can spar with the thinkers just fine.
I can chameleon myself into the extroverts' sphere for short periods, but the only extroverts I can deal with for extended periods of time is ENTPs and ENTJs (at least the two guys I know) -- but there's a limit there too."
1186,isfp,"My two best friends are ISFJs and so is my mama. I just tend to get along really well with them because they understand me and I understand them. Yet they keep me organized and I make them laugh. It's a good combo. :)
My boyfriend is an EN/SFP and we've been together for almost 2 years. He understands my FP so we connect really well there. But we've been called ""the derpy couple"" more than once because we kind of go everywhere all at once. (Mostly me...) Just unpredictable. But I like it that way :) 
I am friends with a couple INTJs too and I tend to adore them. They make fun of me in a light-hearted way for being weird and I enjoy their stability and intelligence. They're able to put logic to my worries which calms me since ISFPs tend to stress easily. I think I also help them be more spontaneous too because we like adventures. "
1187,isfp,"Interesting! According to David Keirsey (author of Please Understand Me), NF's and SP's have the least in common. I haven't met very many NF's, but the ones I did meet seemed to be a bit too emotionally abstract for my taste, if that makes sense. "
1188,isfp,"Hi I'm an ISFP. (M) (20)
Anyways having super hard time in college algebra math classes. 
It's so frustrating because I really don't wanna do any of it, I have absolutely 0 tolerance for math. I have a hard time concentrating for more than 5 minutes, without music on ....... But when I do have music on I'm not concentrating lol.
I'm probably going to fail my math class this semester. And after this financial aid goes away and my parents will have to pay out of pocket............
But I don't think I will pass even if I get another chance, math is too stressful for me........
I don't know if this is all ISFP's or that I just have low IQ ,lol.
But I'm really not stupid at all.......  I'm actually pretty smart when it comes to decision making and thinking for myself and doing things I love etc......... I think the main problem is my tolerance for math. I just can't tolerate any of it........
But  the thing is that I'm scared to give up college, because I fear that I won't be able to make a decent living........ I don't wanna live in an apartment for the rest of my life......... My parents are middle class but they can't take care of me for the rest of my life......... 
Is there any other good paying jobs that isn't blue collar labor based? That accepts people without college degrees?
Maybe a manager at Walmart, Kroger?Do they require a college degree? I'd would love to be teach instrument lessons and other things music related ? But I'd imagine it wouldn't be consistent ...........
Question for ISFP's here , do you have a college degree? Yes or no? And what job do you currently have? And does it pay good? (Howmuch?)
Thank you. Please help."
1189,isfp,"I've always struggled with college. I cant really see myself in a regular job so decided to go back to school for something I love. I'm back in under a pretty worthless degree just to finish and learn more about the equine science world.
That being said, get over it, buckle down, get a tutor. Not finishing school the first time around was one of the most stupid and expensive mistakes I've ever made. Either finish and buckle down, switch majors to something you love, or go to trade school. Dont wallow around for 5 years like I did. You can totally do this and its early enough to change things. My BIGGEST advice for you is to go to your teachers during office hours and ask for ways you can help learn more effectively. In my experience I've gotten great help as well as surprise bonus magic points for making an effort."
1190,isfp,"I graduated college with a degree in Spanish and a minor in Business - I was actually an art major first (staying up all night for weeks on end, though? yikes) then switched to business (numbers all the time? yikes) and anyway, I really only had problems with math a handful of times and I ended up being tutored.. have you looked into that?  Anyway, don't give up because math scared you away!  - a fellow isfp"
1191,isfp,"Graduated with a BA in media studies and minor in art. I struggled with math since High School. I absolutely hated it... Usually, I sucked it up and went to tutoring even when I felt it was a waste of time. Ask the professor for extra credit and DO them. Do whatever you can do to just pass! Also, I took the bare minimum math requirements majors to graduate. Just excel in the other courses. All my media and art courses I got As and B+. Ended up being a graphic/web designer. 
Tutoring helps a lot, especially if you have a great tutor. I was forcefully tutored since elementary. Parents knew I was bad, so I had to be tutored nonstop. Had few great tutors, but a lot of bad ones too. Everyone can learn, but everyone learns differently. Just figure out what's your method of learning. Algebra was one of the easier subjects for me since it's all memorization of formulas. Plug in numbers and follow the steps. Yeah man, I can't tolerate math either, but take school seriously. My biggest regret was not going to real art school instead I choose a liberal arts school. "
1192,isfp,"My only bad grade in college was from some horrible pre-calculus class. I would go to class and just doodle instead of taking notes. I didn't think I'd make it but somehow I did and you can too!
Also, when I was around 20 I thought about dropping out because graduation just seemed SOOO far away but time flies and it got easier when I started taking classes in my major.  "
1193,isfp,"I went to college for illustration, I dropped out due to stupid things I did. I also hated math, but my problem with school was too many drugs. I work in food service for 10/ hr. It isn't great but they give me health insurance. I plan on going back for a 2 year degree next year. 
I would suck it up and get a math tutor, I very much regret not finishing school. If you don't have time to get a tutor drop it immediately and take it another semester."
1194,isfp,"I'm planning on graduating before the end of this year, I only need to finish my master's thesis. I kinda wish I never went to uni to be honest. I'm a curious person and I'm reasonably intelligent, so it seemed to make sense at the time. I also wanted to make my family proud. However, all entry level jobs in my field (cognitive psychology, human factors) seem terribly boring and my internship was a nightmare as well. I'm thinking about saving up some money with my current job (I work in a bookstore, which is pretty nice) and maybe becoming a professional makeup artist next year. Going into translating is also a possibility, I've discovered I quite like that as well."
1195,isfp,"You can do it. I have had similar thoughts of dropping out of school, never really been into formal education. I'm assuming you are only half way through the semester so you should have plenty of time to get your grades up! Just take advantage of office hours and get a tutor. Its just one class and after it you will be done. It's really not worth it to drop out, I mean at worse, you will be 22 when you graduate. And you will just have so many more opportunities with a degree than without one. My parents had to tell me this when I had similar thoughts."
1196,isfp,"I was in your exact position, but I stopped going to college. The classes I needed were all just general education prerequisites and didn't even count as transfer credit(I went to community college), and I had 2-3 left before I took a class that actually counted.  I couldn't learn any of the math and it sort of ruined my semesters at college, and caused way too much stress. I tried getting tutored and a bunch of different things, but it didn't work out for me. I guess I'm just not made to be able to do it, and I think that's fine. Even though I did well in everything else, I progressed so slowly that after 2 years I only had around 33 units. It just didn't seem worth it for me to keep going. 
I decided to drop out this semester and now I'm looking for jobs. I probably won't get anything that pays too well, but I don't really care about that as long as I can live comfortably. I'm also spending more time writing and making art, which  I really like. I'm going to try to get some job that involves art or writing, but I'm fine with a job at a fastfood restaurant or retail store for now. 
I also was thinking about teaching English abroad. There are some countries that don't require teachers to have degrees. I was trying to study German(and maybe Russian) in college, so I'm really interested in language and I think I'd really like teaching English and experiencing what it's like in another country. I'm pretty bored of where I am now and would like to leave eventually, so I think teaching English abroad would be a nice experience.
This isn't really good advice, but it's my experience in your position. Honestly I sort of wish I could stay in college, because I liked taking some courses, but it was way too stressful for me. I felt like my life had no direction, but it definitely had more than what I have now. I guess I'm still figuring out what I really want to do, now that it's not an option for me."
1197,isfp,"Edit:I just read your comment on another similar reply...did you tell the tutor you were having a hard time following their explanations? A really good tutor would work with your learning style.  Also, sensors learn best with a lot of practice, imo."
1198,isfp,"Hey I'm a Spanish major and business minor too! :)  I agree that the numbers in business are only tolerable up to a certain degree. OP- /u/The40I If you're at all inclined at languages I'd recommend getting a degree somewhere in that realm. Language in college is like English in highschool. It's mostly fun, you get to be creative, there's numerous ways to study (watch movies in your foreign language, go to plays, read books, learn about the culture, etc) and you'll have a degree. If you like music, why not try music theory or something? I don't know much about that field of study but I can't imagine it requires much math. I only had to take one math class all of college because of my major, and it has been great. 
If college isn't something you want to do, and you're happy at a lower wage starting out, then maybe look into those music lessons either out of your home or at a local music store in your area? I think school is pretty important but can also be a waste of time and money if you're never going to be able to commit to it. "
1199,isfp,"Ooh, what are the odds?  Haha.  But yeah, one of the best thing about studying languages is that there are many ways to learn. I've always been an aural learner and I still remember the lyrics and meanings to every foreign-language song I learned in class, haha.  
Basically the only downside to majoring in a language is that you have to do a lot of presentations.  I was a pro towards the end, but that was merely a function of having presented so many times before, haha.  That can be hard for us introverts.  :P"
1200,isfp,"lol I totally get what you're saying, it's like wtf no one told you there was another way to solve this problem... Practice and probably finding someone who can tell you what is the correct way to approch the question. Don't forget to ask a lot of questions. Especially why the way you approached the question was wrong.  "
1201,isfp,"I can play the piano, but I'm piss poor at it. The only thing I can really do is Ode to Joy and that's only because I listened to it enough to have an idea of which keys I'd need to press in order to replicate it. "
1202,isfp,"When I was in primary school I played French horn but my brother made fun of me when I was practicing so I quit. Since then I've always been self conscious about taking up another instrument although I've always wanted to. Guitar, sax, or trumpet would be my picks.
Recently my boyfriend lent me his ukulele and I've been playing that and learning some different chords and songs. It's pretty easy to pick up the basics."
1203,isfp,"i can play piano and guitar. ive played piano for... maybe four years now? bad memory. guitar, uh, im self taught and ive been playing for a few months. can play most chords and easy tabs
i tend to enjoy indie and ive recently found out i really like lo-fi. favourite bands are metric and daft punk aaand maybe arctic monkeys?"
1204,isfp,"I've been playing trumpet, side drum and marching flute since forever. Started with trumpet at 8 (40 now), took up the side drum in my early teens, and then when I joined the Royal Danish Lifeguards' drumcorps I only needed to learn the flute to be able to play everything they have. 
I've since experimented with the pipeband style drums, but I'm back in a drumcorps-like setting now. Mostly because there aren't any pipebands near my location."
1205,isfp,"Not a clue. I can't play the guitar to save my life, but that one tune just resonated with me. I actually didn't realize I was playing Ode to Joy until I had finished messing around with it.  I wish someone would teach me to actually play the instrument. My brother gave it to me but doesn't have time to teach me and I want him to know I appreciate it. "
1206,isfp,"Well, what I'd suggest is looking up youtube guitar tutorials. I mean, I'm currently trying to learn how to play A Cruel Angel's Thesis and, if my calculations are correct, I'm learning how to play one second of song with every 90 seconds of practice. I've got the first ten or so seconds down right now. And hey, if a musically incompetent INTJ can figure out how to use an instrument from online tutorials, anyone can. So yeah, online practice is a good idea. 
If that isn't your cup of tea, though, I'd suggest checking to see if any of your friends know how to play guitar. Chances are good that they'd be happy to help you learn. You could also go to events where people are playing guitars and, after they're finished performing, you could ask them to explain the basics to you. You wouldn't be able to do this with, say, Slash, but the college kid at the bar would probably be willing to help. "
1207,isfp,"when I'm with friends and in the moment, I tend to be a bit oblivious to my own annoying tendencies. it's not until I look back at what occurred and I realize, ""oh I guess I came off as petty/self-centered/annoying/etc""
for example, I experience fomo a lot and get salty being left out of social situations, most of which are usually pretty trivial. but I tend to blow up my hurt feelings and I feel like it annoys the people around me when I keep making pointed and hurt comments because of it. another example is when I get so excited talking about myself and my own experiences that I probably make it hard for others to chime in into the conversation. or when people interject and the topic changes I'll steer it back to continue talking where I left off.
self-reflection is pretty important to me but no matter how aware of my faults I am, sometimes I get too excited and still commit these above tendencies. pretty frustrating. 
what are some of tendencies that other people might find annoying? how did you overcome them? or how are you working to overcome them? "
1208,isfp,"Same way although I would say it has gotten better
I try and talk less but say more meaningful things and realize I will always and everyone will always have fomo, it's just life
Good supportive friends help 2"
1209,isfp,"An ISFP perceiving things as they want them to be. My mother is an ISFP, and while she does mean well(seriously), she comes to believe things that never happened and are not true. She'll sit on things for a long time, somehow come to a conviction about something, and then- that's it... that's it- it's done....... decision made. At times, I would know exactly how she's feeling as after 2 decades I picked up some patterns, and when she doesn't respond to others than clearly she's upset.... but should I ask about it I know it'll give her reason to just let it out all and tell others that other people are wrong and not her(Not all the time, she would have -I felt- genuine concerns at times.) The victimization of ISFPs is very, very annoying, because their loved ones might have no idea what's even the problem should they happen to not see the ISFP for a couple days or so.
And should she finally build up the courage to disrupt the flow of things, then she expects everyone to fall in line as it took a lot to come bother people with her problems, and that she only held back out of kindness and consideration for others...... No. Time taken out of consideration for others does not make one right. And then should anyone offer another opinion on the perspective, even my grandparents, than she reverts to a couple versions of ""I can't even."" Some of the things she'll say: ""That's just your opinion"" ""Well, that's just my opinion"" ""It was a miscommunication(not admittance of fault, which would make the other person feel better)""... or at times she just CANNOT be in that room any longer if anyone slightly tells her No on certain days and on certain issues, and then the rest of us are like, ""?????"" Literally, it's a very common IFP thing to believe that the feelings are just SO CLEAR- they are not. Also, her feelings change literally every day and the rest of us don't do that, and if not for my understanding of the system and watching a David Bowie(ISFP) interview than it's likely I wouldn't bother to tell you these things. I understand that Fi will never be Fe, but it's annoying that she would never take fault through that self-righteous value system.... but if she never takes fault, why would anybody else around her?
She has an ENFJ best friend, and my mom doesn't know about MBTI(not without trying on my part though), but so often I found myself biting my tongue to not just tell her that she ought to just talk to the only person who seems to care about her(since apparently her children might as well be watching her drown to the beat of slow jazz)- the ENFJ. It's annoying that when she doesn't feel that her emotions are heard she forces them onto others instead of getting over her initial fears of confrontation; which would solve everything(at least in our family.) It's one thing to want to be left alone, to be respected, and to have one's feelings heard.... but it's an entirely other thing to force those values onto others. If you involve others then expect backlash as one knows an ISFP, at least this one, would do the exact same. Being apart of the problem will never be a solution.
Many times my mother would burst out into tears when she pulls a lot of this stuff, and do you know the worst part about it all? I believe her. It hurt me, a lot. It's annoying that by an ISFP's self-righteousness that they don't realize that people actually do care about them, but that they have lives to live as well. I'm currently on the outs with my mother, have been for a little over a year now, and when my sister gets old enough she likely will be as well as she funnels deeper and deeper into her feelings. 
I do hope you can relate to something in this seemingly over-dramatized backstory of mine, and I wish you well in your quest for self-growth. I would not want to see an ISFP, or anyone else, reach such a point with their loved ones. 
‚Äã"
1210,isfp,"you're right, everyone will always have fomo. I definitely need to mature more in that aspect
and around newer friends I just worry what they might be thinking about me. it frustrates me when my intentions don't directly match my actions or words"
1211,isfp,"I don't trust that Celebrity Types site much. A lot of them seem based on shallow/stereotypical reasons. Just based off interviews of your favorite stars, which ones would you guess ISFPs are?
Princess Diana (somewhat naive in her blunt honesty in that awesome Fi-Se combo)
Lana del Rey
Bob Dylan
James Dean
Johnny Depp
Britney Spears
Marilyn Monroe
Jacqueline Kennedy
Historical figures... All I can name off the top of my head is Martin Luther."
1212,isfp,"Haha. But nah, to answer your question:
No small talk. Just hate it. It's awkward, pointless and honestly kind of stressful. I quite enjoy deep topics, though they can also be quite draining after a while. Real world topics are much less taxing. I love learning about people, so i usually just ask them questions to try understand and get to know them. If i'm close to them, whatever is on my mind at that moment. 
If you're asking because you want to know how to talk to one, ask them about themselves. Not boring, ask them about their personality. Hell, mbti is a great start - i love having conversations about it. It allows for similarities to be made, which is great common ground in conversation. That's just me though. It's quite a difficult question to answer because it can vary. 
‚Äã"
1213,isfp,"I'm wondering if a topic where I'm adept in but the other person, a ISFP, doesn't know of or isn't well-read of- will it make for a good discussion or will I bore the shit out of the other person?
Because I can go on and on about topics I'm passionate about, but I don't wanna be the only one talking about what I love because that seems selfish and self-absorbed. But there isn't a topic where I, and the ISFP, can both can talk about."
1214,isfp,"I see what you mean. Personally, I love learning. If you were talking about something I knew nothing about, but it caught my interest, I‚Äôd happily listen. You just have to make sure it is actually a discussion as oppose to a rant. As in, just ask them questions about it. Even if you are discussing a conversation only you are adept in, by asking them simple questions like their view, or if they have similar experiences, it includes them and will flow much better for the both of you. 
Another thing about isfps is that we take in a lottt of information, but only release it when we feel it‚Äôs necessary. You could think they know nothing about a topic, but come to find out they actually know quite a lot and just stayed quiet until it came up."
1215,isfp,"When I talk about a topic I know, it's not a rant. It's like a full on lecture/explanation about what I know although it may not be of that good of a quality as my oral skills ain't as fluent as my thinking skills.
That's really good to hear. I will take note of all your tips and points given. I'm sure she doesn't know much about a lot of my topics because most people wouldn't either. I know her well enough to know she doesn't know those topics I'm interested in as well.
But what if they don't have any opinion (due to not having interactions with what I'm talking about before). I mean to have a view, you need to know some content first. 
Do you have any tips on what I should do in the event that she starts responding with 'yes' 'no'? Should I steer the conversation to another topic (bored of current topic), prone her to talk about herself (maybe because she wants to talk), stop talking to her (Because she's exhausted) or like, something else? How do I know if a you guys wants some alone time?
Because when I'm texting her, she usually just respond with a short text and then leave to do whatever she's doing, while I always make a effort to (always) respond immediately to make her feel appreciated and wanted. But she doesn't seems to get it and she just takes her a few minutes to respond to me although I responded immediately. I really don't like that but I'm thinking it may be a ISFP thing. Or is she just disinterested in me? I feel really tired a lot of the times when this happens. Because I can speak for hours but when this happens, I start to doubt myself and her as well. I feel like I'm wasting my time.
I want to have long, intense conversations where it's uninterrupted- like I don't tab out from whatsapp to do my stuff while I talk to her. I always give her my fullest attention when we're talking while she usually doesn't. She is always watching movies, shows or whatever. It makes me feel unwanted as she values all of them over time with me. Am I being to available? I thought the key to making ISFP feel good is to give them attention AND make them feel wanted?"
1216,isfp,"reasons why she might be replying slow: 1) doing something else & forgetting to reply (bad at multitasking)
2) overwhelmed/ don‚Äôt know how to reply therefore avoiding to reply for a few mins to hours
3) uncomfortable
i think an interesting convo will catch her attention, heart to heart / relatable things that are comfortable so that the convo can click"
1217,isfp,"Yeah, the other reply is probably quite accurate. It's quite hard to say though, ISFPs can be pretty different from one another. The point made about heart to heart conversations is good. Find a common ground! We love connecting with people and talking about our similarities as opposed to differences.
Then again, maybe 2/3 are just how she is. I often reply quite slowly - not because i don't care, my mind is often just in other places. Maybe talking irl or on the phone is the way to go, so she is less likely to get distracted and just disappear for hours. It probably does suck - and sometimes i feel bad for taking so long to reply, but it just happens. If it really bothers you then maybe that's just something you have to consider.
I'd love to help more, but it really is quite difficult. I'm just not sure. If you have other questions just ask - i may be able to answer them better."
1218,isfp,"Hey everybody! As an ISFP how do you personally feel about how the rest of the type's label you as? I'll start.
One problem I seem to have as an ispf is that the other types especially the more TJ types feel that the isfp don't have the capacity for regular intelligence, not just emotional intelligence. Now don't get me wrong I am a solid isfp, the whole way, I can puppy a rainbow just like every other isfp, but when discussing more intellectual there is the stigma of not being able to carry or follow along the discussion. Anybody else find this to be the case? Intelligence has nothing to do with Personality type probably my biggest pet peeve."
1219,isfp,"Probably people who think making someone angry or pissing someone off is fun. Heck, most of the time I don't really get offended by those people, but the very thought that they find that funny really pisses me off for some reason."
1220,isfp,"This topic came up on the ISFP Facebook group and I said something similar:
1. People telling me to stop being weird as if they're embarrassed by me.
2. People who say dumb things for the sake of preserving a state of conflict and don't actually care about what they're arguing for.
3. When people dismiss my opinions just because I've opened up my silly side to them and they think I can't make an informed opinion just because I suck at explaining things. "
1221,isfp,"The intelligence thing annoys me insofar as that I wish I was more intelligent, and I really appreciate intelligence in others, but I can't keep up with the really clever around me. Usually that's fine until a -tj comes along who literally judges you for it despite massively lacking in interpersonal and emotional intelligence. But hey.. I'm not bitter ;)"
1222,isfp,"People who can't answer simple questions. I have this problem with the person I live with, whenever I ask a ""here or there?"" question, she always has to make an unnecessarily long-winded answer that I have to listen/read through when the answer could have been simplified into one word."
1223,isfp,"If I look laidback or going with the flow, I‚Äôm labeled as lazy, lacking initiative, or flippant.
Where really I‚Äôm probably doing the most work subtly manipulating where the flow is going, based on passion for values."
1224,isfp,It's annoying when I barely know much about the topic and they know even less. And they act like I don't know anything or I'm just not understanding what they're saying. And they will keep going on this topic for hours. While I'm just sitting there trying to move on to a happier topic. Or just a new one in general and just agreeing with what they say. Just to stop the arguments coming.
1225,isfp,"I listen to different education podcasts all day, and I'm very well read in arachnology,( I breed tarantulas, currently own 6 which for most is 6 too many) so I work with and interact with a lot of tj's in the hobby that think they know more or that their philosophy on spider care is the only right way. It gets frustrating and I usually have to step back and just not even comment on their posts"
1226,isfp,"It can be sometimes, we mostly relate on music and gaming but I always lose as you would expect. The ENTJ is nice and gets me pretty much and isn't hateful when I express my feelings. The other which he refused to type and I can't totally figure him out, called me a pussy, (I'm a male) and pissed me the fuck off. I hate society and they're set roles. Id say I'm fairly handy for a man but just because I like to avoid pain doesn't make me a pussy."
1227,isfp,I‚Äôve never met an ISFP so I wanna hear if anyone has met an ESFJ and why or why don‚Äôt you like them. Why would we be at the top of the compatibility chart? Why do you think I would like you and why you like my type?
1228,isfp,"I‚Äôve met a lot of ESFJs (including my mom!), and while I love them, and they tend to love me, I personally couldn‚Äôt see myself being in a romantic relationship with one (although I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be opposed!). ESFJs are nice, because I tend to look out for others and can end up kind of being ‚Äúthe mom friend‚Äù so it‚Äôs nice having ESFJs who will usually try to take care of me for a change. You guys are so sweet and attentive, and I really wish I had more ESFJs in my life!
However, while I love having you guys as friends, I feel like if I dated an ESFJ, we would absolutely drive each other mad. You guys tend to be very structured and organized, are usually good with time management, don‚Äôt procrastinate, etc. Im the opposite. I‚Äôm literally never on time, for anything. I feel weird being early, so if I‚Äôm ever more than, say, 2 minutes early, I will sit in my car until it‚Äôs time to go in. Also, I‚Äôm very private with my emotions, whereas ESFJs tend to be more open. You guys typically feel better getting stuff out in the open, so if you notice were sad, sometimes you guys can pry a little to try to get us to open up, and while this is sweet and well intentioned, talking openly/showing vulnerability usually makes me feel worse, and I‚Äôve noticed a lot of ESFJs have kind of a hard time grasping this. If I‚Äôm upset and don‚Äôt immediately open up, I usually just want some space. And finally, while I know introverts and extroverts usually go well together, I feel like ESFJs usually don‚Äôt like being alone, whereas I LOVE being alone, and the energy level might be a bit too big if a difference.
Again, I absolutely love you guys as friends, and maybe if I met a really chill ESFJ, I could date one, but in general, I think this match is kind of weird. Like, I think ISFPs and ESFJs typically have great chemistry and get along well, I can‚Äôt see that relationship working out in the long run."
1229,isfp,I think because we're both feeling at the top and both have the same amount of sensing/intuition (just inverted) so we get along really well. ISFPs are playful and can be protective while ESFJs are really warm and sweet. 
1230,isfp,"I'm an ISFP (female) and I was wondering about the exact same thing... ESFJ's tend to be more out there while ISFP are more in their bubble. I'm not quite sure if I've met an ESFJ in person before because I don't usually open up, talk and get to know others right away so I'm unable to really judge if the people I'm talking to is one or not unless they admit to me that they are. But as an ISFP, I'm socially awkward and may be hard to approach and can be misunderstood a lot.. But one thing I do know is that I do enjoy talking more with an extroverted person than an introverted person. Because if we were both introverts alone in a room, I would not know what to say to start a conversation and it would be very awkward silence for a bit until one of us takes the initiative to break the ice... But if an extroverted person comes along and starts talking to me, then I feel that I can listen to what they have to say and get to know more about them and their hobbies or whatever they want to share with me and that makes me feel included and happy. Then if they really get to know me and interest me, I find myself to be a bit more extroverted as well. But then again.. ISFP's enjoy their personal time being alone much more than constantly socializing because it is draining. 
I feel that ISFPs are probably more compatible to ESFJs as good friends than as partners in a relationship. That's just my opinion though. "
1231,isfp,"I whisk agree with that. In a relationship I would prefer to have someone that is extroverted. I prefer my friends to be introverted. And everything else you said makes sense. I‚Äôm glad they we can be there to help, we love to. "
1232,isfp,"Mainly because I don't do party stuff, just hang out and chill. The ESFJs I encountered were very social and active. And that's not a bad thing, I wish I was like that, but I guess I seemed boring to them and eventually just disappeared."
1233,isfp,"Meeting introverts is difficult, we tend to stay at  home/workplace/uni/whatever. If this helps... maybe some artists on instagram are this type, but I think we are the shy artist.
We sound great? What do you like about us? I always admired your social capacity (and EQ), and you stableness."
1234,isfp,"Who can really say at this point? Seems like everyone had their own ideas about typing, which don't match each other. Wolverine would be an ISTP. ISFP is like the artsy emotional do-gooder of that type, I suppose. "
1235,isfp,"I love your eye for beauty, that you can find it in the most strangest of places. You engage all your senses and you really remind me to stop and smell the flowers in my no nonsense approach to life.
I like that you‚Äôre quite playful and fun in the most unexpected ways. You‚Äôre very keen on your surroundings where I am dreamy and it helps me focus more on my environment and how to be present in the moment to enjoy every second. 
I like how sure you are of yourself and your values. I‚Äôm impressed that you stick to your guns and stay absolutely true to yourself, because I cave easily to external pressures. But at the same time, I was left broken hearted by this same attribute - still I admire from a distance. "
1236,isfp,"I just took a personality test this week and have been looking into this more. I made the choice to do stand-up comedy this year, after doing improv for a while. Both out of my comfort zones. It's been hard to find any other stand-up comedians who are this personality type. How does one find out about that kind of info (besides making assumptions)? Edit: sorry guys...turns out I'm actualy INFP after all."
1237,isfp,"Ahh how was doing improv? I could never do standup but I want to take an improv class just to see how I stand up to that kind of fire. I feel like everybody else would put me to shame, but it could maybe be so much fun. I feel like isfps could benefit from acting of some sort just to get out of themselves."
1238,isfp,"Why would it matter if other comedians don't share whatever attributes you're looking at?  The fundamental attribute of a comedian is to be funny.  That's it.  Beyond that you can be introverted, extroverted, whatever.  It might even be an advantage to have a different personality from other comedians you've encountered, since you can look at things differently."
1239,isfp,"Yeah, I've been told that I have a Mitch Hedberg-style. I'm female, though. (Also, the whole point is to find my own style). I wouldn't say I'm an unenthusiastic person. So...don't know if all of those descriptions resonate with me. Hopefully I can bring some unique things in, though. "
1240,isfp,"Thanks! That's really nice! I just started doing stand-up this year, so not very good...but I'm hooked on it. I actually posted something in r/standup to see what personality types they all were. So it is dominated by ENTP's? I was trying to figure that out. I just took the quiz this week. I've always been an introvert. Why, should I take it again? "
1241,isfp,"Oh my gosh...I have to say that improv completely turned my life around for the better. I went from someone who was so ""inside my head"" and (to be honest) scared to ""let go,"" to someone who could have trust in others and feel comfortable being goofy with people. Trusting people you don't know is one of the greatest feelings in life. I recommend it for anyone looking to better themselves or to just let loose and feel like a kid again. "
1242,isfp,"I just thought it was worth mentioning, or seeing if anyone out there knew anything about it. I'll probably submit this post in r/standup, probably more applicable there. You're right...funny is funny. "
1243,isfp,"Well, I took a class on it, after taking a year of improv. If you want to get into it, I'd recommend sitting in on some open-mic's near you. (To get a feel for what they're like). Taking a class definitely helped me, though! Hope you get into it! It's so fun. Once you do it, you never look back! "
1244,isfp,"I read about ESFP's. It sounds like you're natural performers, probably better-fit to doing stand-up! Stand-up is a special thing to me because it's the opposite of everything I have ever done in my life outside of it. "
1245,isfp,"Most people don't know this about stand-up, but it's a pretty solitary hobby/lifestyle. Most of the time I'm writing, when I'm not on-stage. So, it's a lot of alone time. Also, sometimes it's fun talking about the boring stuff, and making it funny. That's what I love (like how Seinfeld could talk about something mundane and bring it to life). To me, though, Stand-up is art, that's how I look at it. Thanks for your feedback! Appreciate it!"
1246,isfp,"For example, today I was in a bad mood because my best friend canceled plans with me yet again to hang out with her other friend doing a project that‚Äôs not due for weeks. I don‚Äôt know, the littlest things piss me off. "
1247,isfp,"I get that and I get staying in that feeling for a while. This happens to me often! Usually some alone time and doing something to distract myself helps me make the feeling smaller, less urgent or powerful. And then I get to decide what I wanna do with that feeling. 
I also don‚Äôt think what you‚Äôre feeling in this situation is insignificant and small! It may be worth sharing your feelings with your friend if you feel comfortable. I only say this because since I am easily frustrated by things like this too, I have to remind myself that people can‚Äôt guess what I‚Äôm thinking and/or feeling and also that my feelings are valid. Feeling annoyed is a type of anger. Anger tells you you want to draw a boundary or make a change. Talking about it may help change the situation for the better for you. Good luck :) I hope you feel better! "
1248,isfp,"I'm an ENTP, how can I not mess this up?
‚Äã
I'm worried about draining him, overstimulating him, not being on the same page as him, not being sensitive enough for him, not being able to understand him, etc. Usually idgaf if I'm not ""right"" for the person I like, I just move onto the next one--but this guy is special. I am absolutely crazy about him and that's never actually happened to me before. I know that he likes me too but I think he's a bit worried about some of our differences and how that'll affect a potential relationship. That and he's too shy to make the first move lmao
‚Äã
So, what can I do to ensure one of you guys I'll do my best to keep you happy? And what kinds of things can I do to keep you happy? "
1249,isfp,"I think be yourself tbh. We can sense ‚Äútrying too hard‚Äù pretty easily. If he‚Äôs into you he‚Äôs into you. If not, you‚Äôll move on to someone else who will appreciate you for who you are. And trust me, if he‚Äôs into you, he WILL make the first move. This is coming from a male ISFP. "
1250,isfp,"I hope this is helpful but I'm not sure if it will be. I was terribly into an ENTP a few years ago. I thought she was completely fascinating, always had interesting things to talk about and held out just enough about herself to be constantly intriguing. Best of all was that we were working on a very ambitious project together. I ended up breaking things off when she abandoned said project and refused to talk about it anymore. I think there was some mental health issues involved but she wouldn't address it. Created a very awkward schism and I couldn't trust her anymore, because she severed something she knew was very important to me. So open communication and trust is key, as with all relationships.
ENTPs have a tendency to come across as a bit closed off and superior, at least in my opinion. Try to remain open and available, but give them space. Show interest in what matters to them. Pay attention to any indications that they need some time alone and don't take it personally when they go quiet, but definitely hit them up after a day-ish to show you're thinking about them. "
1251,isfp,"Isfp guy here married to an entp woman. 
All those fears are true for us from time to time. There are going to happen, you both just have to choose to been understanding. If he is getting over stimulated, let him be alone. If you don't understand him, ask questions or about way home telling you and Believe him even if you don't understand. Ect. "
1252,isfp,"Support him in his endeavors and leave him alone when he needs it.  I love that my current girlfriend leaves me alone to work on music, read a book or just relax by myself.  My mood and confidence can vary and she understands that and flows with it. 
Other than that, enjoy the ride!  "
1253,isfp,"This was actually super helpful, thank you! I'm sorry about your ENTP situation, that really sucks :/ I hope it's behind you now. 
The going quiet thing is my ISFP to a tee. I figure that it means he needs to ""recharge"" but I'm not sure how long that lasts for him so I don't say anything until he does. but I think it makes him feel like I don't care about him because I'll wait like a week until I say anything lmao. but since I do care a lot, I'll take your advice and check in a bit more frequently! 
I'm not sure what you mean by ""remaining open"" though. At least, I'm not sure how the best way to get this across is. Can you explain what you mean? For you, what does remaining open entail? "
1254,isfp,"I had a breakthrough in therapy this week about myself. Little things tend to upset me and get turned into a bigger deal in my head. Essentially I have some self hate and nonexistent self esteem because I was raised where having emotions and being sensitive was not allowed and would result in punishment. 
I was always being told that I was too sensitive and to get over things and would get in trouble for showing emotions or having issues from my father. My sibling would also make fun of me for it. the only person who seemed to understand was my mother who seemed to have recognized my childhood depression and my being sensitive, she didn't see it as a flaw but as who I was and loved me anyway. But despite this I learned in school and from everyone else that it was wrong so I buried my emotions and sensitivities and pretended they didn't exist. 
In high school my mother became an alcoholic and possible drug addict and I had to choose to live full time with my father to escape my mothers situation and she died less than a year after I left at 16. 
I then my first diagnosed episode of depression after moving out stopped going after about 6 months because we thought I was okay. I got to college and promptly fell apart. My mothers death didn't really hit me until then and my father became much more narcissistic and abusive and I realized I really missed her. I became suicidal and it lasted for months and I ultimately had an attempt which I hid from my father. 
I slowly have been trying to get myself back together and had this breakthrough this week that despite how much I've been trying to hide it a big part of myself is that I am sensitive and emotional and now I don't understand and know how to handle my emotions and hate that part of myself. 
I'm trying to learn to accept it and see it as a positive buts it's extremely hard for me because I don't like myself much at all because of this and other issues and don't know what to do to make myself feel better about it. I think this would be much easier if I was a woman as well because as a man it seems society says I shouldn't be this way. Which makes it even harder to accept myself. 
I thought I would reach out and see if anyone was similar or had any advice for me. For reference I'm a 21 year old male ISFP(once thought ISTP until I became more honest with myself) with depression, anxiety and ADHD and would really appreciate any advice or support you could give me. 
Thanks"
1255,isfp,"Having understanding people close to you is important. The only person I can share my feelings with is my girlfriend of two years. Having grown up in a stable home I don't really need an outlet for my emotions really, but having someone who doesn't judge me for misplaced emotions and oversensitivity is still a blessing. I also thought I was an ISTP until I discovered that I was hiding my emotions and refusing to express them."
1256,isfp,"I'm an INFP and I have a family that is very validating and accepting of my sensitivity and emotions‚Äîand even with that kind of support in place, it's still really tough!
The things you don't like about your sensitivity are predicated on society's lowest common denominators of what a successful male is expected to look like. But if you accept yourself as an emotional being, that's the first step into a life that can utilize your sensitivity as an incredible strength instead of a debilitating weakness. This doesn't mean you need to transparent about how you feel about everything with other people, but if you can pay attention to what's going on inside of you and perceive what those feelings are telling to you, you're going to have a very powerful tool to navigate and understand the world around you.
I believe handling emotions starts with you simply allowing yourself to perceive what you're feeling instead of judging it one way or the other (e.g. this is a good or bad emotion). You can ask yourself: ""What are these physical sensations going on in my body indicating?""
There are some very validating things I've found out about emotion in a series of four essay written by a practicing marriage counselor. Take a look at the first one, and I encourage you to read on towards the other three if you find it helpful. Here it is ---
God bless.
*edited for typos. "
1257,isfp,"Hello @CaptainQuint77, I'm not super used to reddit & talking about deep stuff with english tongue but I had to answer you. I feel that I am a really similar being to yours
Male, 22 years old, ISFP, chaotic grown, depression, ADHD, emotion unstability and many side behavior created in my mind to defend my feelings.
On my side, I've been screwing everything I dared to start in my life over & over to a point I had no self esteem at all : I failed at school, with my jobs, with my friendship, my love, my relationship with both of my parents ( splitted at young age as you)
I finally managed after years of loneliness to became a decent artist until working in my own videogame company made with close persons.
But even the most perfect situtation I ever dreamed off happening, I wasn't able to not screw again in a way or another with my behavior switch & emotional unstability to a point I tough I was just a cursed being.
I became even more depressive while realising that, but had an inner voice in my head who kept some tiny bit of hopes. I tried anti depressive medication which were a disaster, those are actually lowering the dopamine level in your brain and made me a human vegetable without any motivations.
I was near suicidal, and while medidating about me and all problems I had before acting, I came across ADHD topics and found those so accurate and responsible for all my life struggles that I went all in, with my very last bit of spare money I decided to contact an ADHD clinic.
I've now been taking Elvanse, one the fews pills on the market, and it has been a life changing stuff. self acceptation, awareness, focus, energy, multitasking, hope, happiness. productivity & inovation at work, no more videogames addictions, no more waste or risky behavior, lucidity on dialogue and almost no more signs of depression. 
I've been taking those for 3 months now, but I feel that it's the greatest decision I took in my life, and probably prevented me to kill myself.
Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience while having very similar story and life attributes to yours.
Feel free to MP me if you have any questions."
1258,isfp,"Ya that's a great point about how sensitivity is actually a strength. If you can find an outlet for it where you can make value judgments of a peace of a work without being judged then that's really reaffirming. I write music, others write words plus many other options I'm sure depending on your interests. It's not necessarily cathartic for actual emotions I feel throughout the day. But it's distracting and making something beautiful is something Fi is really good at and something you can be proud of."
1259,isfp,"Yes it is, I've been going for a while now and I can honestly say I think it's saved my life, I don't see how I would have made it without therapy. It's hard to get help but I think it's definitely worthwhile. Remember they are there to help you, it's what they want to do. Hopefully that makes it a little less intimidating. It takes strength and courage to ask for help and I can tell you already have it because you reached out and asked me about it. Best of luck and I hope you can start feeling better. "
1260,isfp,"We could do Google Hangouts and watch other people make music / take turns screencasting, it would be like a small audience of fellow Composers, or we could make a joint soundcloud account. Like an ISFP record label. Or we could do a group chat kind of thing.
1 of the reasons I thought it would be cool to do this is because a lot of ISFPs are musicians (obviously), and a lot of ISFP music seems to transcend genres, so naturally ISFPs should be great for critiquing / making music together. I was on another music forum and someone literally said ""I don't have anything to compare this to so I can't give feedback on it"" (very heavy Si).
Plus it would be fun to have a small like minded group to work with, of people who are mostly nice, thoughtful, and artistic.
comment / PM if you would like to join or have any ideas."
1261,isfp,"ISFPs are pretty conflict-avoidant so if she really went as far as to go full-blown no contact with blocking then I'd consider it done.  This is likely an accumulation of multiple things in the past that you and maybe she herself might not really be aware of. (maybe the past incidents?)  Even if she does forgive you at some point, she's never going to forget this happened.  Keep in mind that part of owning up to your mistake is realizing that you might not be forgiven.
If she does forgive you, I would not try to justify yourself or deflect the blame.  The way you're wording things here sound like you're blaming her for being hurt by these things.  She was hurt by this, but I didn't know. I was too intrusive but my intentions were pure..etc.  You fucked up and it doesn't matter how good your intentions were.
To be honest, it sounds like this friendship has run its course.  If you guys are having fall outs all the time then it's probably best to let this go.  Don't obsess over it."
1262,isfp,"Unfortunately, it's really hard to get trust back once it's been lost. It's probably too soon to try to reconcile. Maybe you should write some pages of complimentary attributes and positives because I believe we need to feel valued. If you took the time to do that, that may help. The more, the better. That will show that she is important to you. As we also like action more than words. We really like to be understood but maybe just acceptance would be enough."
1263,isfp,"I did that already :( I made her a list of her positive traits and put it in a funny homemade card. She didn't really acknowledge it. I understand it will take more than a quick fix to regain trust but I just feel like without talking about any issues we've had with each other, things will never get resolved. "
1264,isfp,"I've asked for advice on how to interact with an ISFP friend of mine a few times when I wasn't sure how she was thinking--and now I'm back. She has opened up to me on a very deep level, revealing a lot about her past. But, unfortunately, she doesn't spend a tremendous amount time with me unless it is to share her problems. She has been very flirty with one guy on the floor, but admitted that she doesn't tell anyone what she has told me because they ""don't need to know."" Is that an ISFP tendency or just me providing an ear she has been increasingly willingly to use? And, perhaps most importantly, what does this tendency show about her perception of /feelings towards me?"
1265,isfp,"So, I don't think she is necessarily using you. If this is a recent thing, then chances are there is a lot on her mind right now and she is continuously feeling it and wanted to get it out. Having opened up to you, she now has an outlet. It is likely that much your time together will turn in to get talking about her problems because she is feeling her problems and feels comfortable with you. Try to increase your hang out time, eventually she should wear down and talk about that stuff less as she gets it out. As far as perceptions, this means that she trusts you and she is comfortable with you, could be more but not necessarily."

1270,isfp,"More specifically, the aggressive ""fuck you haha xd"" types who say random shit just to start shit. 
I can't recall ever having seen one irl, but even in games I play ENTPs who are like this piss me off more than anything else.
How are you supposed to deal with them? Out-Ne them? Ignore them? Roast them?"
1271,isfp,"ENTP elder here.
Let's be specific here. ""Trolling"" has a motivation - the motivation of a troll is to incite; ""just to start shit"", as you've said.
ENTPs aren't any more prone to that behavior than other types - they can be good at it, if it's something they've chosen to do - but it's an antisocial kind of thing, and being extroverted feelers, ENTPs would actually be less likely to choose to do it. ENTPs want people to like them and feel bad when people don't (even though they won't admit it).
So, why do ENTPs have a reputation for arguing for just the sake of it then? Because that is something we do, but it's a totally separate behavior from trolling. To someone that doesn't enjoy arguing, it may not feel very different, but the motivations are totally different. A troll starts a fight because they enjoy making you angry; what ENTPs do isn't motivated by the desire to upset people, it's a form of play - they enjoy the argument itself, and don't want you to get angry about it, they want you to play with them.
Young or immature ENTPs that haven't developed their Fe yet don't always understand why people respond to their mischief with anger. They will start fights and damage relationships by accident - it will often end with them being hurt that someone didn't just play along, and they'll get resentful of other people for being ""too sensitive"". But it's not malice, it's just social ineptitude. Trolls on the other hand, it's all malice. They're doing it strictly to sow discord.
The problem is, since we can't see people's motivations, they can look very similar from the outside. But the way to effectively deal with one is totally different than the way to deal with the other. For a troll, the best way to thwart their efforts is to ignore them. It's all about attention and reactions and if they're not getting them they'll go somewhere else. With an ENTP's banter, though, ignoring it can give them the perception that you're okay with it, which will encourage them to do it more in the future.
The best way to discern where they're coming from is with genuineness. If you're not in the mood for it, say something like ""I know you're kidding, but that hurt my feelings""; ""I know you're just fucking with me, but it's getting on my nerves and making me not want to play with you anymore"". A troll is going to get a thrill from that, but if they start saying things like ""butthurt"" or ""fee fees"" you know for sure they're a troll and you can block/kick/ignore them with no qualms. An ENTP just being an ENTP, on the other hand, is going to be more likely to back off after something like that, and maybe even apologize."
1272,isfp,"Hello fellas, random ENTP here. I can confirm that ignoring the troll is the best response. Fighting back usually ends up in you getting legitimately upset over something that the troll didn't even truly mean. As for why ENTP's like to push people's buttons, it depends on the situation. If you're online or in a video game, it's probably just to fuck with you/for the lols etc...if it's excessively mean sprited it's usually from someone lacking maturity so just ignore it, block them or whatever. But sometimes if the trolling is coming from someone you consider a friend or at least a friendly acquaintance, it's because we are genuinely curious about how you'll react or we are a trying to get you to understand something. And sometimes this is how we show love. I joke that I'm only ""nice"" to people that I don't care about. And as to the whole ""ENTPs can't see perspectives other than their own"", that's complete hogwash. This is what we excel at, and where our infamous indecisiveness is derived from. BUT a major exception to this is when it comes to people's feeeeeeelings. We tend to think logically  (this therefore this and so forth) and often fail to take into account the fee fees when we are trying to drive a point home. But this doesn't mean we don't care or can't admit when we're wrong. I guess this stereotype comes from our biggest fear, which is being made to feel that we're stupid. Immature ENTPs may not admit when they're wrong just to avoid the embarrassment of feeling dumb. I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's a mistake to fight fire with fire in this case. You'll just end up mad and it's exactly what pointless trolling seeks to accomplish. But don't view ENTPs as aimless trolls because you got frustrated by some idiot online. End ramble."
1273,isfp,"What others call ""trolling"", we call challenging their perceptions.  A lot of people are afraid to get outside their comfort zone and think about things in any way differing from the norm.  ENTPs can't help but challenge that.  We're also sarcastic a-holes to boot, so if you can't stand that sort of behavior, you're pretty much just going to have to avoid ENTPs all together.  It's kind-of our nature to be provocative, inquisitory, and over-the-top."
1274,isfp,"ENTP trolling cN be grouped in a few catergories.
Immaturity, curoisity, and mosy likely...boredom. Best bet is to ignore the troll portion of the convo and push on. If they wont drop it, drop the convo completely."
1275,isfp,Fire back at them and make them respect you. Then you'll be on equal footing in their heads. Then become emotionally exhausted by your actions and disengage!!!!!! Hahaha my ex was an ENTP and the way we communicated was so difficult to be on the same wavelength.
1276,isfp,"Entps are annoying to me mostly because they cant see outside themselves in a certain type of way.. I avoid them. Some are cool tho.
Edit: i will rephrase it closer to the way i actually see it. Its less that entps annoy me  its just that it seems we're never gonna be on the same page."
1277,isfp,"You don't, you debate them and get them to open up, throw in these types who are more fitted to fulfil the job of exterminating or extracting their attention. INTP, INTJ, INFJ, they'll know what to do. You can't outNe who's an NeDom as ISFP are tertiary. After these said types engage, leave them be to their private business and affairs. That would probably lead to talks about world destruction. You have the power to make these conditions happen, OP! Do it. Great power comes great responsibility. :) - INFJ "
1278,isfp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/entp] How does an ENTP get out of this ‚Äútrolling‚Äù phase? People seem to really hate us when we can‚Äôt control it. Where does banter end, and trolling begins?

¬†^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
1279,isfp,"100% this. As an ENTP, I avoid debates of any kind with strangers until I've probed them a bit and figured out if they are willing to have fun exchange of ideas. If not, I don't ever challenge their ideas, beliefs, or factual inaccuracies and banter about other safe topics instead. If I find those lovely souls who aren't offended by sarcasm, then I poke holes in concepts and toy with ironic social constructs as we enjoy mocking the system. It's a blast, but it's not for everyone. ^_^"
1280,isfp,"Eh. I wouldn't say it hurts me emotionally. Most of the time I troll out of boredom and the whole ""thriving on attention"" is off base as well. 
What you're talking about applies to young, immature ENTP."
1281,isfp,"This is the right answer. They don‚Äôt mean 5% of the things they say. They generally don‚Äôt mean anything. So in real life, walk away. Online, block them. They will be very hurt because they exhibit that trolling behavior to get a reaction out of you. That is to feed their tertiary Fe. (ISFPs fall into Fi-Ni loop. ENTPs fall into Ne-Fe loop.)
So if you ignore them, they will be disappointed and lose that troll energy. If you punch them, they will like it. Because that reaction fed their Fe, though their jaws will hurt. 
ISFP Fi-Ni loop: worrying about the future (Ni) and getting hurt (Fi)
ENTP Ne-Fe loop: saying whatever they feel like saying (Ne) to whore for attention (Fe)."
1282,isfp,The ENTP will shut up momentarily because he fears for his life. But he will still be thrilled by the experience. He‚Äôll boast later like ‚Äúthat dude really pulled a knife on me wow can you believe that lol lmfao wtf haha really yeah that was fun.‚Äù
1283,isfp,"What do you mean by ""can't see outside themselves""? 
The way I see them is that they're basically hollow boxes that live for exploring, debating, experimenting and observing external stuff. They're like the anti-Fi."
1284,isfp,"Source?
You dont understand functions at all. This is 100% untrue friend."
1285,isfp,"I mean a lot of things that i say... if you are an Fi type, you may confuse meaning with caring. There are many things that i believe are true, or are false... i dont deeply care about these things in particular.  But i do care about FACTS. I want the truth, it is very important to me. So when i randomly start debating with somebody, I usually mean what i say... but i dont put my heart and soul into it because thats just not how i work. The amount of shits i give about a discussion doesn't change the outcome. Either you are wrong, i am wrong, or we are both wrong or right. Caring about the topic is a hindrance more than a help"
1286,isfp,"Yea theyre soooo anti fi that theyre blind to certain things. They have like this tunnel vision on their own perspective.. They cant see outside it. Theyre so smart that it makes sense of course, but idk. they undervalue and dismiss/cant even see certain angles that i see deep value in. Idk I know im being vague... Maybe more mature ones arent like this. "
1287,isfp,"This is interesting as an Entp.
Below somebody mentioned not admitting when we‚Äôre wrong. 
I‚Äôm very aware of this, thankfully this plays straight into Ti. I desperately want to think logically and am quite happy to put energy into swallowing my pride and considering another argument/perspective. I think good job to myself every time I utter the words ‚Äúoh yeah, you‚Äôre right. Good point‚Äù. 
Another aspect that might play into what you‚Äôre saying is the concept of steel manning an argument. Almost the opposite of straw manning (a type of trolling where you twist their argument and then attack a weak simplified version). Instead of weakening their point and attacking that, you can strengthen that. My favourite example of this is people who believe in horoscopes. It is extremely tempting to troll them. But instead I can say ;‚Äùyou‚Äôre right it would be super useful and interesting to better understand types of personalities and yourself. I understand why you like horoscopes because of that. You should have a look at mbti, I find it much better at achieving that goal.‚Äù Instead of shutting down stupidity you educate or strengthen the opposing point."
1288,isfp,"i think you said that pretty well. i'm an entp and i'm just now starting to realize this ""blindness"" of mine. i used to pride myself on how well-thought out my analyses of certain situations were but now that whole thing has been shook because of this entire realm that i'm just now starting to see. i still don't even start to see it until the situation is already over, and have to recoup by apologizing or otherwise telling them that i now can see.
it's a strange thing because i think my social iq is generally very high but i'm completely retarded in this regard."
1289,isfp,"I think it‚Äôs because they consider a lot of possibilities (Ne) and examine them (Ti), that it‚Äôs rare for them to overlook some possibilities. So they assume it won‚Äôt happen. 
When they are wrong, they will not admit it. They will pretend they are right. They know they aren‚Äôt right. They just want to see your reaction faced to their stubbornness. 
Also they don‚Äôt consider Fi and Ni readily. Their perspective is really different from yours. "

1291,isfp,"Im not really talking about the capacity to have humility swallow your pride. 
See heres my perspective when it comes to people who believe in horoscopes. I dont believe in them myself but when i encounter someone who does i can understand the way its a part of their own reality. I can see why its important to them and why they might believe in it and how it helps them. i recognize that internal reality as a small yet valid facet of reality that exists. I like that a person can see a pretty rock as possibly having powers. I see innocence and imagination in that.  i appreciate that the belief in it exists. I can step into their emotional reality and i can be there with them even tho i dont believe that horoscopes or crystals have real merit. I dont have any urge to troll them. Meanwhile the typical  entps pov is:  horoscope believer= person who believes dumb thing. (And a lot of times that goes further into: =dumb person as a whole) then theyre like: "" let me help the dumb dumb out and lead them to the correct smart path. Im such a good person for doing this instead of embarrassing them yay me.""
Idk how much that has to do with my original comment. But thats just an example of why i dont like that entp point of view. I could just be very naive myself. I dont know. Im kind of in an fi-ni loop myself right now. Im in this nihilistic hole where i start to disappear. But this is just me blabbing on and on now.
Maybe im trying to preserve my own self importance with this. I expect you to rip my answers to shreds somehow."
1292,isfp,"You're right. Sometimes it's not even about being right or wrong but how and when you approach it. We get stuck in our perspective of facts and truths and logic so much that we disregard the wider context. It's like getting so caught up in driving you don't look where you're going. Admitting I'm wrong in that kind of mindset is quite hard, even if I realize I am in fact wrong.  
Also, yes, the ways Ni and Fi do things are a complete mistery to me. "
1293,isfp,"You're contradicting yourself so much 
First you say:
Then you say:
So first you say ENTP have tunnel vision on their own perspective. Then you say they examine every possible possibility. Then you speculate that they just know they dont overlook anything.
Wtf? Youre not making ANY sense."
1294,isfp,"But if someone is objectively wrong about something then why not try and help them by fixing their broken beleif networks? Like, they're going around with false information. And you know it's false. Would you not tell someone if you knew they had a disease?"
1295,isfp,"I didn‚Äôt say you have a tunnel vision. That is a different person. When you can‚Äôt read, nothing makes much sense. 
Sarcasm aside, what I said is ENTPs are so adept at considering possibilities that they don‚Äôt usually assume that there are possibilities they didn‚Äôt consider. Ne isn‚Äôt a perfect sweeping lense. Much like INTPs who don‚Äôt think they can fall for logical fallacies because that happens rarely. 
Do you understand now?"
1296,isfp,"That's up to people to decide for themselves, I guess? Whether they want to be told. It sounds absolutely insane to me but who am I to judge?  
Also, ENTP here, I think I know what you're talking about. This is Ne taking unrestrained flight. We spend our lives building a strong intuition for the world at large, building a picture that we see others lack. That gives us confidence. Sometimes, makes us assholes.   
On the other side, that picture lacks detail; which sometimes makes us miss the point completely. It's not that things we say are wrong per se (that's why we insist), just not relevant to the matter at hand.   
So until your ENTP learns to snap out of Ne's addictive flow and tune in to both his Ti and Fe when it's appropriate, you can expect mockery, even if it's in good faith. "
1297,isfp,So my husband is an intj and my mil is an istj. I get along with both. I feel like with istj is that they are very black and white on things. With intj I feel like there is lots a room for the grey area. You can reason and talk about your views. I feel like with istj they already know what they think and it‚Äôs very hard to change it. Which might make them look grumpy. 
1298,isfp,"social yet quiet, need alone time but get restless when alone for too long, hates parties but loves getting together with friends, loves attention yet modest, humorous and always wants to be involved, needs affirmation, friendly yet skeptical, impulsive yet careful, hates loud people yet can be loud, loves making people laugh, only serious when in a bad state of mind
how would you type with this description?"
1299,isfp,"mainly, i'm talking about my outside demeanor. i'm usually pretty serious at home but always try to have the happy go lucky light hearted attitude with other people. but when i'm at my worst, i become so serious in every aspect of my life "
1300,isfp,"okay, that makes sense. when you say serious in every aspect, would you say it's more that you become hyper-driven and concerned with planning and decision-making, or that you experience any sort of paranoia, intense fear about the future, feeling trapped?"
1301,isfp,"I think you'd have a better chance finding the answer you're looking for by figuring out the types of parents and the types of their kids. I have an ISFJ mother and ESTP dad, an ISFP sister, and an INTJ brother. I'm an INTP.
My grandma is an ENFJ. I presume her first husband is an INTP, though he may be an ENTP or INTJ. He's an unhealthy, abusive alcoholic philosopher with ego issues. Their kids consist of an ISFJ, an ESFP, and I'm not sure what the other one is (ISFP??).
My dad's brother is an ESTP (a twin), his sister is an ISFP??, and I'm not sure what his dad is (introverted sensor if I had to guess), but his mom is an ESFJ.
My grandma has an ESTP brother and an ENFP sister. I don't know what their other siblings are (one is an ISTJ I think; the others died). I don't know what their parents were. The dad was in the military, and I get XSTJ vibes from him, but then again, he was in the military."
1302,isfp,"I've been really interested in going into project management or an analyst role once I eventually finish college but I was just wondering if ISFPs like to go this route? Some things that are enticing about these careers are the computer-related work (I love computers), the benefits, and of course the great pay. But are there certain qualities we possess that prevent us from doing well in these roles? I know we tend to gravitate to much more creative and hands-on type of work but  at the same time I know a bit of it has to do with our own mindset and motivation but I'd like to know what you all have to say about this. Please feel free to chime in on anything you may have to say about your jobs/careers anyways too. Thanks for reading!
edit- a sentence"
1303,isfp,"you shouldnt worry about if xxxx would want to go this route, just ask yourself if you would enjoy it.
dont let those 4 letters define who you are and who you aren't, there's always room to grow as a human being :)  you might not be the analytical type right now, but whos to say in a years time you cant develop that quality?
i think the question you should be asking yourself is if your love of computers would outweigh the cons of the job "

1305,isfp,"I am an ESFJ (25F) exclusively dating an ISFP (29M) for about six months until he broke it off with me yesterday because I pushed the subject of commitment. There‚Äôs a bit of history in my posts if you need some background info.
I feel like he genuinely cares for me but he is really confused about his life and isn‚Äôt treating me the best. He seems stuck in a rut and I have been using MBTI to try understand and help him but I don‚Äôt know how I can help him if he keeps shutting me out. I knew he was introverted and needed his space, I didn‚Äôt need labels from him and while I wasn‚Äôt forcing ‚Äòcommitment‚Äô with me, I wanted him to understand I didn‚Äôt need labels but I do need security and stability which he wasn‚Äôt providing.
He broke it off with after that conversation because he couldn‚Äôt commit. He tells me he likes me a lot but I don‚Äôt know how much of it is he just doesn‚Äôt like me enough or if he‚Äôs actually going through something like he keeps telling me but is pushing me away to avoid dealing with it.
He wants to remain friends and that we could revisit in a few months when he sorts himself out. I was visibly upset, I thought it was cruel considering he has apologised for his behaviour in the past saying ‚Äò(I) am a complete d***head, I would be a damn fool to not chase after you.‚Äô
In spite of all this I am concerned for him and really wanted to help but I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. I‚Äôm also a bit heartbroken because even after all this, a part of me is still trying to look for solutions. I don‚Äôt want him to punish himself over this.
How much of this is genuine ISFP needing help or is he just stuffing me around? Would waiting for him to magically pop out of his shell one day been as fruitless as having conversations about commitment? I‚Äôm at a loss."
1306,isfp,"Sounds like me a bit. My advice is to tell him how nice your future will be and that you want to build something with him. 
I'm not afraid of commitment, I'm afraid of commitment with the wrong person. Maybe he is like that too."
1307,isfp,"How long have y‚Äôall been dating? Just because he‚Äôs an ISFP doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs the same as me, but I like things to go very slowly in relationships. I don‚Äôt want to be vulnerable and have strong feelings for someone until there‚Äôs a strong emotional attachment. I‚Äôm relaxed about flings, but long term relationships freak me out. I need to have known the person for awhile. "
1308,isfp,"When people get into relationships (specifically men) their priorities must change. And Especially when ""commitment"" comes up. You focus on them and not yourself 
He probably is scared about his personality changing. For me at least love is synonymous with sacrifice and that changes somebody. It's a life changing experience that you cannot back out of. (Mentally and legally)
It's a huge risk, especially with the 50% divorce rate nowadays and the suicide statistics for men afterwards
NOT saying that is what would happen, but how would you know if it works out until you try? Then it's to late.
It seems like you were getting along and he liked that. A commitment (marriage) would change things. Otherwise why would it exist?
He probably won't change. And I sympathize. 
It sucks that you are learning this now but it's my best asessmnt as to what's happening."
1309,isfp,"He did ask that if we did end up together if what type of relationship problems we would have. I mentioned communication, but that‚Äôs a big one. 
I have tried to be as unwavering as possible. He was taken aback one day when I finally told him how much I was holding and said ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre really different. I‚Äôve never met anyone as understanding as you,‚Äô and repeated questions of why I still like him. I think he is pushing me away for whatever reason but it might all be wishful thinking and he just doesn‚Äôt like me enough to commit. 
I want to stay and see it through but also at what point do I need to cut back and save myself? The entire relationship is on his terms."
1310,isfp,"I haven‚Äôt pressured him until now but it‚Äôs six months now of being exclusive. We are basically in a relationship, I see him regularly. I don‚Äôt need labels, I need to know that it‚Äôs going somewhere and that it isn‚Äôt casual (he has tried to reassure me of this but in only words rather than actions). I have been fine with waiting for him but after my friend finding his Bumble profile (I believe him that he deleted the app just not his account), I need a little more from him. I don‚Äôt want to push him but is it too much to ask for at six months?
I have basically been as forward as I can be and tried to be as consistent as I can to reassure him of that. I have been trying to help him through his rut and he keeps asking me why I still like him."
1311,isfp,"Hey, thanks for replying. I appreciate it! Although I‚Äôll specify I didn‚Äôt want marriage commitment, just acknowledgement we were in a relationship!
I have an updated version of what‚Äôs happened since this post. Without going into too much detail, it turns out he‚Äôs still in love with his exgf from a few years ago and I look eerily similar to her. It‚Äôs clicked in my head that he was trying to make me fit into a box shaped like her, based on the things he would say and the things he would do. It makes sense why he liked being with me, because I reminded him of her, but he would pull away because I wasn‚Äôt her. 
He‚Äôs lied to me about everything. I meant absolutely nothing to him, every word, every lingering feeling of connection. Nothing he‚Äôs said has held any weight at all. He actually went out on a date with a friend of mine last week (who freaked out and messaged me when she found out what happened). I think he‚Äôs trying to recreate these moments with her and clearly not interested in growth. He actually admitted to me that he has ‚Äòunintentionally‚Äô strung along multiple women in the last year. Whether or not he‚Äôs stuck on her or the happiness of the past, I don‚Äôt know. But he‚Äôs in it deep and judging by his demeanour, he‚Äôll be there for a while. "
1312,isfp,I know he did the same thing to another woman a year ago. He said he isn‚Äôt making the progress he needs to make. It‚Äôs just so hard because it was so great for the first few months and I‚Äôm still holding onto that. He told me he felt a connection he hasn‚Äôt felt in a while. Maybe I just came at the wrong time in his life. I hope you‚Äôre okay though. It‚Äôs a horrible feeling. 
1313,isfp,"That sounds awful. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. You will need to learn to forgive yourself. I worry my ISFP will do the same thing. I just want him to grow and be healthy.
I remember my dad asking to see what he looks like so I showed him a photo. My dad is excellent at reading faces and people and made a comment how he looks depressed and capable of committing suicide because he looks like is unable to escape his thoughts and demons. I brushed it off, but he hasn‚Äôt been wrong yet about any of his impressions, even when it takes a few years to manifest. 
The best thing you can do in this scenario is to learn from it so you grow. There‚Äôs no point marinating in these toxic thoughts and beating yourself up about it. You owe it to yourself to become a better person and to be happy. It‚Äôs been six years, you have to let it go. I wish your heart peace. "
1314,isfp,"If he's an ISFP, he's not probably dominant in a relstionship. I think he is in a phase of questioning everything, doubting.
In those times I need someone that says ""Hey, we will be together. For sure. I promise."" I literally need someone to force on me to take me out, in my thoughts and IRL.
BUT. I don't know the details of your relationship and maybe what you're saying are signs of him that he doesn't like you anymore, and that's him slowly losing the spark.
Nevertheless, if you think there could be a solution and wish to stay with him, try. And let him see that you're trying."
1315,isfp,"I‚Äôm not telling you as an ISFP, I‚Äôm telling you as a girl...but do everything you can not to contact him after he‚Äôs broken it off. Don‚Äôt expect to get over him quickly, this isn‚Äôt really possible for anyone. It sounds like there are better guys out there. When you meet the one, he will be excited to commit. This guy doesn‚Äôt seem trustworthy because he‚Äôs giving mixed signals. You‚Äôll probably think he‚Äôs the one and will come back to you for awhile, but I promise this feeling will fade. "
1316,isfp,"This could actually be about him and not you. Don‚Äôt take it personally. We‚Äôre a fickle people.
ISFPs also tend to be very selective of who they let in and see all the vulnerability and ugliness. There isn‚Äôt a single person I would have let in after having known them for 6 months. 
He might just be going through something that he can‚Äôt go through with you."
1317,isfp,"I think it‚Äôs harmful to stay at this point. 
We were supposed to meet up so he could give me my things back and said he would give me a time by Tuesday. The day of rolls by so I check to see if we‚Äôre on. ‚ÄòOh, that‚Äôs today?‚Äô I don‚Äôt want to make him feel things for me or make him feel like he has to see me if he wants time alone/space or whatever it is he needs.  I stepped down and gave him the option to drop it by my front door or leave it in his mailbox so he wouldn‚Äôt have to see me. 
He sends me a text nine hours later that he‚Äôs going to post it. I can‚Äôt push him to do things or he‚Äôll go into flight mode. I can‚Äôt give him space or he‚Äôll go into flight mode. 
I just have to let him go. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do. Believe me, my Ne has tried. 
Thanks for sharing your take though. I appreciate the support and kind words. "
1318,isfp,"I still have to see him tonight to get my things back. I really hope I don‚Äôt crumble because chances are, I will. Your advice is solid and I think I‚Äôve always known all you‚Äôre saying but have swept it under the rug. I still want to believe the best in him and I will choose to do that. What‚Äôs the saying, leave the pieces where they lie and just move tf on?
It‚Äôs gonna suck hairy tennis balls. But it‚Äôs a chance for me to introspect and I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm not going to not come out as a better person because of it. 
Thank you for your honest answer. It means a lot. "
1319,isfp,"He‚Äôs opened up to me twice since we have been dating.  so I guess I would call that a win? He insists it‚Äôs all about him and nothing at all wrong with me. I know he is going through something and have offered support, but he sees that as conditional support and seemingly won‚Äôt take it. 
The problem is I don‚Äôt want him to feel like I‚Äôve a abandoned him because he‚Äôs too ‚Äòdifficult‚Äô and ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô but I also can‚Äôt wait for him indefinitely. I do want to stay but at what point is it unhealthy for me if it isn‚Äôt already. "
1320,isfp,"Hi ISFPs. This is my first reddit post, and it is because I have reached a miniature revelation that makes me nervous. I know that this may sound silly, but I have found that every man I've ever had a serious crush on happens to be an ISFP. I wish that I could calm my heart, but I don't know what to do. These feelings keep plaguing me! My idealizations of a meaningful future with someone always turn into thoughts of some ISFP. These musings feel heavy on my chest, and it is with embarrassingly high disappointment that I read about how incompatible many people seem to think we are--INFPs and ISFPs. It feels a bit ugly of me. I feel like some sorta perverse and sweaty weirdo to have the thought of an MBTI type make my heart race... I just find you guys so mysterious and alluring! When I think of having a pleasant conversation with an ISFP, I feel vulnerable, like the butterflies inside me are pulling my strength away. You are all just so talented and cool!! I would love to bond with someone who is so similar yet so different to what I am familiar with. I want to learn one-on-one how you all see the world...I want to learn more about you... Maybe this isn't so bad, but I'm unsure. I know some other types that tend to find me interesting, but I can't definitely say that I've interacted with any ISFPs. I'm quite afraid that they will find me insufferably boring. I really am sorry if I sound like a huge ole creep right now. I don't know what else to say...Please, is there any advice for this sort of thing? Sorry if I sound strange in the bad way, and thank you for reading my post!"
1321,isfp,"Lol a lot of my best friends are INxPs :). Tbh, people tend to see me as kind of mysterious and many people have told me that I‚Äôm kind of hard to get to know, but honestly, it‚Äôs not like I have some brooding secret, I just live in my head and kind of forget to talk instead of just observing sometimes. I will say, I definitely am kind of hard to get to know. I‚Äôll randomly be outgoing sometimes, especially if I‚Äôm around other friends, but I‚Äôm always intimidated by people who are really extroverted or who seem cool to me. I think a lot of ISFPs, aside from naturally being private and independent, also tend to have kind of low self esteem and might be kind of shy (although, this of course does not apply to all ISFPs). But I just think it might be kind of helpful to remember this, and to realize that with ISFPs, you might have to kind of put in a lot of the leg work initially until they are comfortable around you, but if you can find a common interest or something, conversations will probably be a LOT easier. But good luck :). I absolutely love INFPs, so I‚Äôm sure the ISFPs in your life would probably love to get to know you :)."
1322,isfp,"You shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed of these feelings :). I believe that all types can get along in some way, personal experiences can cause some people to be attracted unexpectedly to certain types for different reasons.
My absolute best friend is an INFP, we grew up together and we get along great, but all the turbulent moments in our relationship resulted from my inability to express my feelings in the immediate moment, causing for some hurtful misunderstandings and passive aggressiveness on my end (ISFPs are known for being bad at verbally expressing their thoughts and feelings, they prefer to express through actions). There was also some difficulty in finding things we could do that we would both equally enjoy (an activity that I would enjoy would often tire him and vice versa), but I still find his company both enjoyable and comforting; he‚Äôs one of the few people I can truly and completely be myself with, and I appreciate him a lot for that. An INFPs greatest gift to an ISFP is their natural ability to understand their emotions; ISFPs don‚Äôt really understand why they feel the way that they do, they just do. This pairing can very much work in my experience, as long as enough time is given to overcome said obstacles :).
A very beautiful example of this dynamic would be Zuko (ISFP) and Iroh (INFP) from Avatar the Last Airbender."
1323,isfp,"Thank you so much for your help! You're very right, I think the hardest part will probably be actually getting to know each other without an extroverted helping hand in the mix lol. I have heard similar things as an INFP--the stuck in the head bits. I feel bad for intimidating others on accident, but it really is difficult to show your truest before you're close to somebody. I will have to be more willing to adapt. It sounds necessary...I can't hope for a connection to find me without putting any effort in myself! Thank you again for the extra push. I really need to hear these kinds of things. It can be easy to slip from reality and fall into the kind of thinking that is only realistic in fairytales. Not that that way of thinking is bad, but I have heard with N and S differences I may have to adjust a little bit. Sorry if that's inaccurate, I really am new to these things. You sound like a pleasant person. "
1324,isfp,"Thank you for your advice! I'm glad to hear that even the turbulence can be worked around with enough time, patience, and mutual appreciation. I always loved Zuko's and Iroh's dynamic..I'd love to help someone learn to understand themselves in that way! :¬∑]"
1325,isfp,"Happy to help! Iroh is a fantastic example of why INFPs are regarded as ‚ÄòThe Healers‚Äô. They‚Äôre the most beautiful people I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of knowing, and I‚Äôve never felt a natural kinship for any other type than INFPs :)"
1326,isfp,"So today, I woke up at 3:45PM because I was up late watching TV and doing stuff on the internet. Big mistake. I got up, made breakfast, and went out to finish mowing the lawn (I started it the previous day but it started to rain so I had to stop).
I actually like mowing the lawn. My dad pays me to do it, for one. It's also a good excuse to put my earbuds in, listen to music, and just not talk to anyone for a good hour or two. Plus I get to see some nature. We have multiple patches of clover in our yard, and I saw a couple bumble bees doing their thing in the clover. Every time I came to one of those patches, I treated it like a traffic intersection. 
Stop. Wait for bees to move. Proceed.
Now most other people, like my dad, would probably be thinking ""I don't have time for this, keep going! Run over everything in my path, I have work to do!""
I was busy, and I did have other things I needed to do and it was already late in the day. But I hate rushing, it only stresses me out more. Instead, I chose to 'stop and smell the flowers', so to speak. I ^could've run over the bees with the mower, but that seemed like something only a ~~logical person~~ heartless monster would do. I like bumble bees. They're cute. Bumble bees and honey bees are the only ones who won't sting you for no reason. All other bees are scary as hell. As someone who has/has had multiple bug phobias over the years (it changes, so I'm not sure I'd call them 'phobias'), this is a really good advancement.
I finished mowing a while ago, and after a shower and drinking a bunch of water I still have a ton of work ahead of me (another late nighter, who hoo!). But I couldn't help thinking about how Introverted/ISFP-ish it was of me to just relax and enjoy the present moment instead of worrying about all the other things I had to do. It kinda proved to me that, even though some books/articles/real life people make Introverts come off as self-centered brats, we're really not like that. We're can have friends, and socialize with them. We're capable of feeling emotion, and acting on it (ISFPs especially). We're not sociopaths. We're not anti-social. We're not depressed. We just need some alone time, and that's okay. I know that. You know that. And at the end of the day, that's all that matters.
^^Edit: ^^Grammar"
1327,isfp,"I don't know where you're going with this rant, ahaha.  At first I thought you were talking about how ISFPs seem leisurely and lazy to people, which is valid.  We tend to not rush and just enjoy our time.  But then your rant turned into something about introversion which is an entirely different discussion??  I don't feel like introversion has much to do with our leisurely attitude, haha."
1328,isfp,"Not quite a rant, and I don't understand what the entire idea of this is. You've described the thought process of most any person who enjoys some time alone, not very much unique to the ISFP here.
I'm an INTJ/P, so my opinion isn't really what you are looking for, but it seems you haven't read too much into other personalities or talked to others about their relaxation time."
1329,isfp,"It didn't really have a point to it. I was just bored and this sub had nothing new so I just started writing. I guess this is just some of the stuff that was going on in my inner monologue.
Me neither. I'm sure there's a few chill Extroverts out there."
1330,isfp,"curious as to why you describe yourself as a J/P?  Have you read through the cognitive functions? http://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/182ri9/comprehensive_mbti_post/
Assuming you haven't (and I mean no offense if you have): as an INTx type you'll either be a Ti-Ne combo, or a Te-Ni combo, and you'll find they're actually pretty different.  Also, whichever is dominant will determine whether you're an extroverted or introverted type (which I recently learned has nothing to do with social extroversion/introversion or ""where you get your energy"", despite popular misuse).
For example: After reading thoroughly through the cognitive functions I determined that I am Ne dominant with Ti as a secondary function, which meant I was an ENTP (Ne-Ti-Fe-Si).  Hope this info helps you narrow down your type!
And since I like your username:
Flynn ENTP: ""Bio-digital Jazz, Man""
Clu INTP: ""Am I still to create the perfect system?""
Tron ISTJ: ""I fight for the users."""
1331,isfp,"Dunno really. I study people in my past-time, and every single subreddit dedicated to a MB type repeats itself. It's like everyone desperately wants to identify themselves with a linear and limited view.
What happened to just asking questions about other things? You come here with the understanding that you'll be reading responses form others like you, but that doesn't mean the entire subreddit has to be about it.
I left my own personality's sub after a month, everything was the same and no one tried to demonstrate their individuality. Everything is 'look how I'm exactly like you!' and 'we all do this, isn't it cool!?' I want to see how, despite the similarties, everyone manages to be unique and special with quirks, faults, and weaknesses.
I have great difficulty trusting people, and I tend to be overly ignorant of the feelings of others. My sense of logic is more developed than my emotions, emphasizing with people is easy, but understanding not. These are some thing that are wrong with me, I don't need to be part of a group to show my differences.
So when you and others write things like this.. what are you hoping to accomplish? You already know these characteristics are your trademark.. why not ask what makes us people. "
1332,isfp,"Ti Ne no doubt, I love my way of thinking and solving, and it's true that I'm always searching for the oddballs and specialized people.
I like my name too, Star Trek, my own name (which I made before knowing about the movie) and a star all in one. It's all me, I'm going to keep it throughout my life."
1333,isfp,"I once thought I was an ISFP, never unsubscribed. Um, I'm also a little fandangled as to what you're trying to tell me (overthinking your response and getting nothing).
My phrasing was brash, I believe I could have been gentler, if I sound like I'm reprimanding OP that's not what I intended. See, I remember virtually every conversation I hear and read, makes reading posts that repeat quite numbing. 
The INTJ subreddit is nothing but this. Take a look over there and try to spot the matches.. on the first page. Good lawds it's amazing how uncreative we are, despite lauding ourselves as the scientists and thinkers of humans.
At least the ISFP subreddit can claim honest ignorance, it's good to pay more attention to how you make yourself and others feel. 
You're good people, live on."
1334,isfp,"There is a lot of circle jerk stuff that goes on in the MBTI subreddits, especially /r/introverts and /r/introvert. And I gotta admit, I've been guilty of contributing to said circle jerking. I don't even remember why I wrote this, it's not like reddit is my personal diary or whatever.
You want quirks, faults, and weaknesses? Because I can give plenty of that. I, too, have difficulty trusting people, I don't even trust my parents. Come to think of it, I don't think there's anyone at all I completely trust, and I don't think there ever will be. I'm not very social at all, and I get teased a lot about it from EVERYONE. I have two friends and that's about it, but both of those relationships are deep and meaningful to me. My parents, especially don't understand, and call me things like ""anti-social"". My emotions are wild and out of control at times. My actions and decisions are guided entirely by emotion some days, but that's why I've been working on developing my thinking and intuition. I try to look at the logical side of things, rather than just how I feel about the situation. But that's just a very small part of how messed up my brain is.
And back on repetitive circle jerking... it is nice to know that there's other people who feel the same way you do, and that you're not totally alienated. But it shouldn't be happening all the time in a subreddit. Once in a while when a new member joins, maybe, but the entire subreddit shouldn't consist of it."
1335,isfp,"That's because the xNTJ's Ni and Te work to prune the tree of possibilities (making them decisive planners and strategists, a.k.a. ""fieldmarshals"" and ""masterminds""), whereas the xNTP Ti and Ne work to expand the tree of possibilities (making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas, i.e., creativity, making them great ""inventors"" and ""architects"").  So an INTJ probably isn't going to be creative despite being logical and clever."
1336,isfp,"Hm.. domestic abuse? That's my story, probably/maybe why you spot the similarities.
That emotional side you cite, it gets better with time, all you need is experience and a reason to suppress. Logical perspective is smart, but I'd suggest you try to find your own strong points and develop those first.
Now.. messed up, I do not believe. I can understand a sense of not belonging, confusion, and emotional turmoil, but those don't make you an anomaly. Your life should stabilize quickly once you decide your path, all mental states are temporary.
True, good to see others, and your final thought I agree with."
1337,isfp,"But isn't that assuming most INTJ's haven't developed their other skills? A young child would be expected to be uncreative and logical, but once you grow older the rest of your personality begins to flourish.
I like to figure better ways to go about worn paths, but that involves a lot of connecting and thinking. My definition of creativity is that, discovering or creating new ways of going about some activity. Figure yours is different, but this is me.
It is not my intent to mock or discredit you, let me know if something hits you like that. I've had issues with not checking my tone properly, it's a point of constant improvement for me."
1338,isfp,"Thanks. You made my day a little better. :) I know right now I'm probably vastly underdeveloped on an emotional level because I'm only 16. Hopefully as I get older, and go out into the world on my own, I'll mature quite a bit and have a fuller personality."
1339,isfp,"The parts that are likely flourishing are your dominant and secondary functions (for you, as an INTP, it's your Ti and Ne).
Which I think is another way of saying ""shadow functions""--and while this is just an opinion, I happen to agree with the guy in this short video
Basically if you roll a Wizard in an RPG, you're going to try to max out your Intelligence and dump your strength, if you're really good at math and bad at sports you're probably going to hone your math skills and dump sports all-together (at least, that's the rational thing to do when you consider what you bring to a team of different specialties).
I think our definitions of creativity are similar, but how it's done by the brain is key: maintaining a flexible and open mind, connecting together seemingly unrelated ideas and nurturing possibilities long enough for them to develop into novel ideas and solutions. an xNTJ will want to prune the possibilities and strike for the one plan that seems (and probably is) the most practical and superior to the others, whereas an xNTP will give those strange and outlandish ideas enough time to mature and grow.
Haha, INTP's seem to get accused of that a lot!  No worries--ENTP's enjoy a good debate and rarely take things personally (i.e., I debate ideas, not people).  It's said we get along well with INTP's for that reason."
1340,isfp,"Yeah, it's a bit difficult to find people like you, willing to gel with us and our words. Lost a girlfriend of 3 years to that, whom I suspect (based on things said then and recently) dropped it off since she believed I didn't have proper feelings and cared little for hers. Eh.
It was a good learning experience, but like everyone I need to work on it more."
1341,isfp,"You all seem like such amazing interesting people. but none of the ones I know seem to show any interest in speaking, they give short concise replies when you address them directly. If you don't address them directly, they don't care. Ok this they I'm talking about is one person... and I really like her... and I don't know why I like her because it's not like I even know her very well... and I'm Fe inferior so I'm just floundering and wondering what to do next... what are some ways to get you all talking??"
1342,isfp,"aw <3 i cant speak for all isfps but i'm quite shy especially around people i don't know well and when in a group setting, i feel like i don't have anything interesting or relevant to contribute to the conversation so i don't really speak unless spoken to - but i can assure that we are listening. as for how to get her talking, find something you have in common so it's not like you're talking about something you don't care about, we love to connect and can tell when people are just talking for the sake of it ahah.
since you're istp, our se-ni means that we're sorta on the same wavelength! and sometimes you don't even need to talk to get to know someone, to an extent, obviously. i find that sharing music can somewhat tell a bit about a person. anyway, good luck with her!"
1343,isfp,"Male ISFP here, 
I don‚Äôt tend to talk a lot but if you find one of my interests where I feel like I have something to share (they tend to be intense, for me it‚Äôs cars, technical things, public health, problem solving, photography and etc.) then I will open up and talk more. I also need to feel safe when talking so it can take a while even if I like you to open up. But if I feel that I can trust you, that we have a shared interest (I‚Äôm very conscious of the fact that what I‚Äôm talking about may be boring or annoying to you. Probably because it can happen in reverse to me (personal example is sports) and that you actually want to talk to me or get to know me then I will open up and want to reciprocate. 
Also give her time to respond, I tend to need to think before I speak especially with new people. 
That said I‚Äôm also totally clueless to people liking me so for me being a little straightforward and telling me that you like me would probably help, although even that might go over my head. 
That said everyone is different even if they have the same Myers Briggs type.
Edit: I may have missed the main question. I am hard to get to know because I‚Äôm scared of interaction. I fear getting hurt and don‚Äôt feel that anyone could like me so I assume they have no interest or that they just want something from me. It takes a while to get past this and for me to see that it‚Äôs genuine or doesn‚Äôt have a negative motive. That said I‚Äôve also been emotionally abused and neglected my whole life by my family so it might be different for other ISFPs."
1344,isfp,"Sounds a lot like what i do :/ for me its because im not a great conversationalist combined with some social anxiety. I dont add to conversation unless im addressed directly because a lot of times im not sure if im welcome in the conversation or i am nervous to assert myself without invitation. 
I give short answers because i dont know how to further conversations well. If i dont have an opinion on something i find it hard to find things to say. 
I am best at interacting with people i have known a long time and not that good at feeling comfortable with new people so while im friendly with most it is rare that i actually make a new friend.
It may not seem like it but she could have some subtle social anxiety that isnt apparent to others. making it SEEM like shes aloof or doesnt care. 
A problem for me is that i like a lot of people and want to be friends with them but i cant ever manage to get there."
1345,isfp,"I‚Äôm an ENFP and my boyfriend is an ISFP. 
When first getting to know him I was basically pulling teeth! He was hardcore the hardest person to get to give you any type of information about himself. He is extremely shy, so I of course, made it a personal mission to get to know him. He noticed and slowly let me get to know him because I truly made an effort to do so and he appreciated that.
The fact that we worked together helped a lot on my behalf because he was basically trapped in a building with me for 5+ hours a few times a week so he inevitably had to give in. 
Now here we are three years later and he talks around me nonstop. It is still a little difficult to get him to verbally express his feelings, but I think that‚Äôs just his nature bc ISFP‚Äôs express more with physical gestures/actions than verbal ones. 
But if she‚Äôs anything like my precious and wonderful ISFP I would say stay persistent because they are totally worth it!! 
As far as things you can do to get to know her, 
get her one on one and ask her about something she likes, or get her to explain something to you. My isfp loves explaining his interests to me (he is extremely techy and I am not). This will help her open up and be more willing to talk to you in the future. Keep approaching her and talking, but with different subjects and you will find out a lot. 
My ISFP doesn‚Äôt like talking in group settings unless it‚Äôs amongst his closest friends. I noticed while getting him to open up to me that I basically have to probe open-ended questions to keep conversation. "
1346,isfp,"We do Snapchat... she snaps me pretty much every day (initiates contact)... but a lot of the time, when I reply, she doesn't respond unless I ask a question. Does wether or not you will have a conversation just depend on your mood???"
1347,isfp,That's partially your problem. I am a mouse in a group with people I don't know or if I know them well and one person I don't. Engage them one on one instead. ISFPs have a hard time verbalizing as well so it might be better to try and connect on something you are both physically experiencing in your environment or on an interest they like. 
1348,isfp,"Lol ok. I understand that. Also she doesn't particularly like having conversations over text, that's how some of the worst misunderstandings between us happened. (Which were entirely my fault) I tried to have earnest conversations over messenger."
1349,isfp,"Hi ISFPs of reddit. I (mid 30‚Äôs/F/INTJ) have been dating an (early 30‚Äôs/M)  ISFP for the last 8 months and as you can imagine, we don‚Äôt often see things in the same light. Most of the time it‚Äôs fine and provides some balance and insight (for me more than him I think) but when something comes up that we see differently, it turns into me ‚Äútelling him what to do‚Äù if my opinion on the topic differs from his. 
I try to frame things from experience/intuition and try to use I and we statements vs you statements. In pure INTJ fashion I will also try and make suggestions or suggest alternative options when he isn‚Äôt happy about something in his life or we‚Äôre trying to find a balance. That usually gets interpreted as me telling him what to do even though he may agree that what I‚Äôm saying holds merit. 
Any suggestions on this? I‚Äôm open to working on my communication style, but when I try to flex it still seems like it doesn‚Äôt translate. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how much is me and how much is his stubbornness. "
1350,isfp,"Sounds like you‚Äôre doing too much.   Maybe this ISFP doesn‚Äôt want advice on how to improve their life. Remember ISFPs don‚Äôt like to lead or be lead.   I mean as a general rule people want to be heard and not told.
Where it gets tricky is sometimes ISFPs take the path of least resistance. IE ‚ÄúFine you just tell me what you want to do then.‚Äù ... and say it while being slightly annoyed because they feel like they are being controlled.
Let things happen a little more organically and don‚Äôt try so hard."
1351,isfp,"Maybe the way that you're communicating or going about it is the reason why he gets so emotionally stubborn to what you have to say to him? Remember, ISFPs are gentle and emotionally sensitive to others and want only to seek harmony in their relationships. They don't really like it when someone confronts them about something or seems controlling or is not easy to understand what exactly it is you are trying to convey. That's because they can sense it in the persons tone of behavior or actions towards them which they will feel, but not say it out loud to avoid conflict and in turn will cause them to want to become stubborn. 
I suggest trying to approach it like how he would approach you about the matter through his own words, feelings and actions. Talk to him in the ways that he knows how to handle and how it can be good for you or others involved. That way he can be more open about his feelings to you. Maybe he will come to understand it better too. If you can, be more encouraging and reassuring to let him know that you are not trying to hurt or judge him in any way. Though if you pressure him, he will most likely withhold from talking about things. I also suggest being more specific when you communicate to him and refrain from adding self-importance. Like don't say generic or broad things (like he is said person type or why he is like that) because he might take it too personally or might not get the chance to give you a fair answer. You don't want to make him feel accused of something instead just give him details about the little specific things you see from your eyes. If he sees what you are trying to describe to him, he will come to understand what it is you are feeling. 
Also, if he's still conflicted afterwards, give him some space and time to think about it to reflect. Just try to be more patient. He probably doesn't want the problem to stick around for too long and will eventually find his own resolution on the topic. Hope this helps!"
1352,isfp,"Will preserve social harmony, will act everyday as if nothing is wrong, won‚Äôt discuss and even deliberately hide suffering. Will be very much secretive as to what one‚Äôs really feeling. Might resent people not feeling his/her pain. (Opposing Fe)
Will think a lot of other possibilities and ways of getting out of the pain including scenarios of future being out of suffering, but all will still be negative. Will think that it would be even worse once they get out of the trauma. Specially when in the process of being okay again, might at times think that things will get much worse in the future and would rationalize the idea and believe it as a fact somehow. (Trickster Ne, Demon Ti)
Prevailing negative thoughts would be thinking they should not be trying new things anymore as it is what gets them to trouble, they should just stick to what is comfortable, etc. (Critic Si)"
1353,isfp,"Very accurate description of my emotional life. I have a real problem telling others of my own issues, despite being the main person in my friend group to hear the problems of others, who they come to vent to, etc. this, along with unsupportive family has led to have low self-confidence, and problems with depression and anxiety. 
Arguably the best part of 2018 has been the strides I‚Äôve made in being open to friends I trust and know actually care about me."
1354,isfp,"Hmm, I am having troubles thinking of a specific trauma so if you could give me one I would happily use that to explain.
For the opposing Fe, the first thing that came to mind was Paul McCartney‚Äôs (an ISFP) [reaction] (https://youtu.be/m0EXODSLbsI) towards the death of John Lennon. He only learned of it a few hours ago that time, yet his only reaction was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a drag, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù As you can see on the vid there‚Äôs not much emotion, looks like he was trying to act as if it was a natural thing. I watched another older video of him being asked about some major issues and he said exactly the same line. I could guess that an ISFP would do the same, when asked about the obvious reason of pain they would seem to be ‚Äúshallow‚Äù in knowing it themselves.
However, it might not be true at all. It would seem like Paul just didn‚Äôt care about John afterall, but if you watch videos of McCartney years after Lennon‚Äôs death you know that it has affected him deeply. When talking about anything related to music or the Beatles, he would pander on about the random, interesting or funny thing he and John did, and it‚Äôs interesting that he would talk about him as if he‚Äôs still alive. It‚Äôs like he cannot detach himself from the past at all and it‚Äôs sounds like he‚Äôs in denial of what happened. I think this could be a critic Si manifesting.
For trickster Ne and demon Ti, I don‚Äôt have any concrete examples yet, but a recently recovered ISFP would have random thoughts of things in the future happening terribly. The ISFP would rationalize it using demon Ti (‚ÄúI guess I won‚Äôt go out tonight. This bad thing might happen right? Wait, that is exactly what will happen, look at how A and B happened? And it actually makes sense because...‚Äù)."
1355,isfp,"Hmmm...I don‚Äôt know about other ISFP‚Äôs but I know that I‚Äôm not like that. If it were the death of someone, I wouldn‚Äôt act like nothing happened because I need to grieve especially if I was close to that person. I would prefer time alone to mourn, reflect, and process all my emotions. I notice that with emotional trauma, I have to release it physically at first because it gets so overwhelming. Like I cry and cry until the pain in my chest subsides even if it‚Äôs momentarily. Then I usually write because it‚Äôs very therapeutic for me and  when I‚Äôm all ready to come to terms with it,  I confide in my best friend or someone very special to me. Emotional trauma is well...traumatic. I understand that it‚Äôs a part of life and you have to just take it as it comes. But it‚Äôs good to address it and move on, learn something from that experience. "
1356,isfp,"Ive been a member of /r/isfp for a while and i dont think ive ever seen isfp parenting discussed. So for anyone that is an ISFP parent or knows an ISFP parent, how would you describe their parenting? obviously there are no perfect parents, but what are their strong and weak points?
just trying to shake up /r/isfp from all the relationship posts"
1357,isfp,"I'm ISFP (I go back and forth between the latter 3 dimensions but that's my most recent quiz result). No idea what my kid is since she's 6, but she's definitely an introvert.
I think my greatest strength as a parent is my ability to be nonjudgmental and accepting. I truly want my daughter to do what makes her happy. If that's marrying 89 year old Donald Trump when she's 25, then I'll grit my teeth and make sure her room's ready for her when she gets divorced. (OK no. I'll kidnap her until she comes to her senses. But almost anything else that makes her happy would be cool.)
I'm also very warm and affectionate with her as we're both comfortable expressing our feelings that way with people we're close to. I tell her I love her all the time.
Where I'm weakest: I tend to be pretty low energy and sensitive to stimuli so there are a lot of times when she'll want to play or interact with me and I'm just not up for it. I get annoyed with her (and show it) too easily. I'm also not very good at making things ""special"" - we celebrate holidays and everything, but I'm never gonna be the parent who makes the backyard into a treasure hunt or whatever. "
1358,isfp,"My mom is an ISFP and I‚Äôm an INFP. Unsurprisingly, her parenting style has always been very easy-going. I always felt like I had a lot of room to make my life choices.
She always made sure we got all we needed, without doing too much. She wasn‚Äôt one of those moms who cooks a special cake for your birthday or a designs you new costume every halloween. She streamlined her task-related life in order to make time to just enjoy life.
She had a bit of a dependent personality though, the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too good for my husband‚Äù type. I felt like she had trouble standing up to herself."
1359,isfp,"My mom is ISFP, my sister is ESTJ, and I'm INTJ. My mom is a worrier, which can get on my nerves. I shared my type with her a few months ago and since then she's almost used it as an excuse to check in more. I moved to finish school across the country from her and the rest of my extended family. 
My sister and I are quite different in life in general, we choose very different paths. I'll admit she has always been more noticeably stable in her life than me. My mom struggles with viewing me as stable as well just because I don't date often, have many friends, and I study for an isolated career path. 
She supports me all the same, but if she ever has something to tell me, like when my cousin who's also 24 got engaged, she started the conversation like someone had died. I don't understand her methods of thinking that I can't handle someone else's choices that are different than mine. She's a good mother, but sometimes may over estimate my feelings towards being viewed  as (relatively) normal. 
Edit: on mobile "
1360,isfp,She's ruled with her feelings and doesn't understand that you reason with logic. She sees you as colder/reserved and thinks you're hiding how your feeling. If you want her to back off you need to communicate your thoughts to her more - she acts this way from misunderstanding not because she thinks you need to be handled like a teaspoon.
1361,isfp,"I recently started looking into mbti and found it interesting so I did a few tests. At first I thought I was INFP, and some of it really fits, but some does not. I've been doing cognitive functions tests to see, and they mostly give me ISFP instead. When I read the descriptions and differences, I feel like I could be both.
I also had a test say I was an ENFJ, but that just sounds strange to me. I am, however, much more outgoing than what people expect from an introvert when I am comfortable and well.
Do you have good resources that help with typing IxFP?"
1362,isfp,"Here is a good link. I was in the same boat as you, but this post made it clear that I'm an INFP."
1363,isfp,"What can an anxious, worried, stressed, mostly lost in the head ISFP do to be more grounded and stay in the present more?
I assume meditation is a starter. 
Also what does an unhealthy ISFP look like? "
1364,isfp,"I feel at my best when I‚Äôm having my alone time somewhere nice outside like my backyard. I lay out a blanket, sit there and pretty much do anything that feels right. It varies between singing/playing guitar, playing cards, drawing, or even listening to music and watching the clouds or trees.
But yes, meditation is highly underrated and has been a big life changer for me."
1365,isfp,"What are you stressed and anxious about, OP?  You might just need to learn a little balance.  I NEED time by myself to read, write or play music.  Sometimes I just need to go for a walk alone through the city with headphones on.  Also running or exercise really seems to help me.
How‚Äôs the balance in your life? Do you feel like you‚Äôre taking care of yourself?"
1366,isfp,"When I'm at my most unhealthy I am so overcome with anxiety I pick up little habits like picking at my nails and aggressively chewing my lip. Everything startles me and I am constantly on the defense. I'll spend all of my time staring at screens and pull away from loved ones, clinging to my most affectionate cat as ""the only one that could ever love me"". It's very dramatic.
It is essential for me to get light exercise, spend some time breathing fresh air while taking in my surroundings, and to use my hands in a productive way. Having a good conversation with anybody to build a sense of belonging somewhere helps a ton. Having a mentally stimulating book/tv/game to feel excited about is great too.
Oh and cleaning. Appeal to your inferior Te and organize your living space. Few things send me reeling into a bad mental state than a messy kitchen. "
1367,isfp,"As far as i know, from experience, binging and isolating, avoiding social interactions, being impulsive(in a bad way), blocking when stressed etc. are traits of an unhealthy isfp. To overcome them i relied on exercise, some meditation and leaving my comfort zone, the last one is hard to do, but just go slow and steady and it'll work. You won't care about certain things that made you anxious or uncomfortable(talking to a stranger, exercising in public etc.), just take it easy amd don't force ""progress""."
1368,isfp,"Like you said, I‚Äôm not taking care of myself well enough. I used to meditate daily in the mornings but I l‚Äôve lost track of my healthy habits and now I‚Äôve been indulging myself in internet surfing, which is an ineffective way to wind down. I really need to get myself together and get back in touch with myself. "

1373,isfp,"I'm INFP. About a month ago I began chatting with an ISFP guy online, and we ended up chatting for about 2 weeks. The reason it went on for so long was because it was difficult to try to get him to arrange a time to come and see me. But I really enjoyed chatting with him, he was so funny and sweet and would sometimes make me cry with laughter. We both seemed very interested in the same kind of thing from a relationship, where we both wanted to experience something serious since we were both tired of the promiscuity that is rife in the gay community. And he seemed really into me, where he would initiate the conversation every single day.
Then we finally agreed a day. He even told me what train he was going to get. But then on the day we were supposed to meet he just stopped replying altogether. After a few days of hearing nothing from him I decided to delete him on all social media.
A month later I saw him on tinder and I swiped left just out of intrigue. We matched. He then wrote to me on tinder and said he was sorry and said that he liked me so much that he got really nervous and just stopped responding. Then he did the same thing where he was writing to me a lot and I got reminded of how much I enjoyed speaking with him, so I eventually agreed to meet him.
This time we did actually meet. I went to his neighbourhood and we went to a cafe together. Afterwards we went swimming in a lake (we had agreed upon this beforehand so we both brought swimming trunks). We subsequently sat behind a rock in our swimming trunks and chatted and made out. I really enjoyed the day. I was possibly slightly more reserved than I might otherwise have been because I was apprehensive about letting myself be too swept away by him in case he might just ignore me again. But now after we met, he's gone completely cold again. He hasn't stopped replying to me altogether but it takes him about a day to reply to my messages, whereas before he would often reply almost instantly.
I don't know what to do or think about him. I really liked him - thought he was gorgeous, kind, funny. But he just seems to be making things very difficult.
(Another note: He took a photo of me when I came out the bathroom which I also thought was a bit peculiar.)"
1374,isfp,"I don't know if this is just me but I've realized I'd ISFPs are a lot like cats. We want intimacy on our terms, maybe a little commitmentphobic, but can be very cuddly and sweet when we want. When the other person is showing an intense interest we may get spooked because it's a lot of attention we're not used to but sometimes we enjoy that rush. 
But maybe that's just me, though I've noticed it in other ISFPs 
So my advice to you is to throw the aloofness back at him, don't get too invested or show too much interest, maybe even ignore him a little so he has room to want you. 
Something you can do is telling him hey I'll be at X place doing X this day and time if you want to join me you're more than welcome and then do that thing whether or not he shows up, show him you don't need him but he'll have fun with you if he's willing to put in some effort. "
1375,isfp,"I am often compared to a cat by friends, family, and coworkers (once they get to know me better). I used to think it was cute, but now that I see how it's actually more true than false I feel kinda iffy about it haha
I 1,000,000% resonate with this."
1376,isfp,"Honestly, yes. But it's quite hard for us to see ourselves that way, we see it as self-protection. And an ounce of openness toward you feels like a pound to us. Once you have us, we are loyal and dependable and great friends/partners. 
For example, someone leading us on/lying to us, hurting our feelings, most non Fi types would just get over it quickly and not take it personal. ISFPs remember that. The stuff that hurts us, we remember. Makes us even more guarded."
1377,isfp,"I appreciate art and music, but haven't put any time into doing it myself. I would like to pick up a guitar over the summer. I used to be into fashion but I've found myself wearing just t shirts recently. I just find a lot of summaries of our personality trait as ""the artist."" "
1378,isfp,"Even as an isfp, you still would have to put in just as much time and effort into the arts as any other type to ""get good."" Guitar can be really fun but it takes time to learn the chords and rhythms to get to a point where you don't have to think to play. It can be discouraging to some that it takes a lot of time but if your heart is in it, anyone can play guitar. Also, your fingers hurt like hell when u first start. That why I chose piano. Just as difficult, but less pain.
Also this is not to discourage you from picking it up. Playing music is such a rewarding experience and I get this feeling like nothing else when I play, especially when I perform so the pain and hard work and time are definitely worth it if your heart is in it"
1379,isfp,"Just as not all INTPs are scientists or programmers (some are musicians, writers, actors, etc.), not all ISFPs will fit the artistic stereotype. Typology does not explain 100% of your personality.
ISFPs' values can manifest as activism, care for others, etc. ISFPs make extremely good paramedics and trauma surgeons."
1380,isfp,"I consider myself not very artistic at all. I play the saxophone and have a deep appreciation for music, but actually creating Something? I just can‚Äôt do that. I tend to have a lot of creator‚Äôs block. "
1381,isfp,"I'm somewhere in the middle. Some art forms I can really get behind, but others it's just kinda ¬Ø(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø.
Photography and Theatre are two big ones for me, but I wouldn't touch stuff like painting/drawing with a 10-foot pole."
1382,isfp,"My sister is an ISFP, but she strangely doesn't act like one. She's addicted to social media and seems to have other unhealthy behavior involving her image or self-image, she strangely conforms to things like trends, and she'll lie in bed all day and watch movies or get on social media.
She's grown up with an emotionally immature culturally out of touch ISFJ mom and emotionally immature ESTP dad who believes Fox News.
She has a college age emotionally unintelligent egotistical INTJ brother who has anger spells, throws tantrums, and who acts like an edge 10 year old (he'll  curse with him being angry being the excuse..even though the reaction is very disproportionate). He treats the people around them and talks to them like they're idiots but not in an ""I scored a high IQ on an IQ test"" way. He acts like Gen Z, Y, X, and the Baby Boomer generation are full of stupid people.
Meanwhile, I'm perfect. I mean come on. Jokes aside, I don't really cause problems in this family. I just try to avoid it all as much as possible and manage my interactions with my parents.
She was on volleyball teams, and, based on what I've seen/heard, there was major psychological issues there.
She grew up most of her life in a really weird town in regards to how it operated socially. It's like it operated in a bubble with some outside influence, but when that influence came in, it behaved and aged very strangely."
1383,isfp,"Any type, when faced with problematic situations, has the capacity to hide behind something like social media. It is used as a distraction from things that hurt. Not that that necessarily is whats going on. I dont know the situation. Her preferences may have changed, maybe she enjoys what she is doing. Idk, if you really think something is wrong, start doing something about it. Random fags on the internet (me) cant help you, i mean really help."
1384,isfp,"Are you entp? Because you sound very entp and it would explain why you don't really understand her. It's true-- Fi dom and aux makes people self-absorbed especially when unhealthy. Fi dom will share something very personal and sensitive to entp and entp will feel uncomfortable about personal/ moralizing things and joke and Fi will feel like entp is making fun. Fi will rant and entp will joke again or say ""then just do something about it"" when Fi would just like to rant/ blow off steam. But, you seem to care and as her brother you should try to understand her and her Fi. Don't write it off over some stupid ideological system. You guys are family."
1385,isfp,"I tend to do very badly with ISFPs. I have a tendency to annoy them, hurt them, or tick them off unintentionally. Then, I'm confused as to what the heck I did that bothered them. I've tried helping her, but she seems to have some sort of problem with it like it's weird, super awkward, embarrassing, or uncomfortable or something."
1386,isfp,"Hey, GreggWilliamsMcstick, just a quick heads-up:
realy is actually spelled really. You can remember it by two ls.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
1387,isfp,"Yall are siblings. Mbti is NEVER an excuse for just accepting problems. You have to grow your relationship with your sister or you will grow apart. Even if it takes you literally saying ""hey, i think we should grow our relationship because i dont feel like I understand you very well."""
1388,isfp,"Wondering if this is an ISFP related thing or just me.  When I plan on going on a trip or anything really exciting is going to happen in my life, I don't really think about it.  I don't set expectations for said event and just let it be until it happens.  I know it'll be awesome and I leave it at that with no further thought.  This makes it so when the event does happen, I have no expectations and always means I look back on the experience with happiness as I didn't fail to meet a certain expectation.  Why would I hype up an event only to make it easier to be let down?  Its like filling up silence with words that mean nothing to solely fill the absence of sound.  
Now I always leave my life open ended anyways and rarely have concrete plans, so this also applies to the spur of the moment drive to the beach or whatever.  But do other people here do anything like this?  I feel as though when I explain this to people who are swooning over some awesome thing they are doing they just dont get it. "
1389,isfp,"Me too. This is exactly how I live my life, basically without the expectation that anything needs to be a certain way, or even will be a certain way. I absolutely adore when things are supposed to go a certain, but then the complete opposite happens. It tickles my soul. "

1391,isfp,"I've been hanging out with my ISFP friend for a while. This is my second year knowing him, and we're good friends, share a lot of common interests (even classes), and live together in a shared house. I see him all the time, we hang out and text a lot, and study together at coffee shops from time to time. AND I have affections for this guy.
But lately, I've been getting really confusing signals from him. He's very kind and thoughtful towards me. He'd offer to drive me to places (when other friends ask, he'd decline), study with me late at night... basically a lot of acts of service. He's also really patient with me and listens to my late-night rants about stupid people and stuff.  And from what the other guys and his roommates tell me, I'm the only one he does this for. 
But the other night, he casually mentioned his ex-girlfriend from a while back and told me that he wouldn't mind getting back together with her (although he didn't imply that he actually would do it). He also said he had a dream about her, and felt weird about it. I don't know why but I felt really awkward and hurt about it, but I've been trying to ignore the feeling and stuff. 
As for myself, I haven't really shown him in any direct way that I'm interested, particularly because I'm a bit scared it won't be requited, and also because he just got out of a relationship two and a half months ago. The only way I've ever hinted that I'm interested is by hanging out with him, texting him, doing small things for him, and stuff.
I guess what I'm trying to get at is... what's his deal? I don't understand why he's being so kind and patient towards me, but casually talks about his exes with me. I would never ever mention stuff like that around him because I like him... so is him talking about that a sign that he just sees me as a friend?
TL;DR: I like this ISFP. He does a lot of nice stuff for me, but talks about his ex with me. I'm confused and I don't know what to do. "
1392,isfp,"One of the major characteristics of an isfp is their deep caring and concern for people they are close to. Like you. As for his mentions of the ex, it might only be a passing thought. When the opportunity comes up, mention to him that you think the two of you would be good together, but don't set your heart on it, just put it out there that you are interested, then carry on as usual. "
1393,isfp,"It's likely that he likes you back, but right now if you start anything romantic with him it's doomed to fail because he still has feelings for his ex. Most people take more than a few months to get past that. Give him some time and space. Most ISFPs take a long time to figure out how they feel about someone. You don't want to date a guy who doesn't know what he wants - trust me. "
1394,isfp,"Other than just blantantly telling him, how else should I express my interest in him? I'm not sure if I'm ready to tell him... but I'd like to show it a bit more. I'm just unsure how. I'm naturally a distant person so any advice helps. "
1395,isfp,"It's hard to tell. On my part, certainly. Tension? I'm not sure. Where we live, there's certainly an awareness that we've been hanging out together a lot. 
If it makes a difference, two days ago, I spent a whole day with him just doing school work and other random stuff. I basically told him thanks for putting up with me and that if he needed space next time, he should just ask.
His response was this: ""But I really like going and doing stuff with you though :D"" followed by ""I enjoy your company so don't worry"""
1396,isfp,"I used to think cat because of their independence and all that, but the thing is cats don‚Äôt really care about others, while I am deeply and genuinely caring. When I love someone (most people) I see them in a wonderful light! 
I think the ISFP spirit animal is a panda! Pandas are happy-go-lucky, independent, loving and caring! Also they‚Äôre adorable lol"
1397,isfp,"As an ISFJ, when the other person disappears from my life, I would usually feel really hurt and rejected even if I believed that it probably wouldn't work out in the long run.
How do you usually feel when you break up with someone? Are you able to switch off your emotions and move on quickly? "
1398,isfp,"If you have an emotional bond to someone, there is no way of turning them off, there is only a way to hide them, sometimes from yourself and sometimes from others. There is no such thing as switching them off. The thing with emotional bonds is that, after a time they get looser and looser."
1399,isfp,"Either I try my best to hold on to the friendship... but if I give up even though I still want to be friends with them I'm just the kind who would cut off completely... but I'd feel really bad.
Like the time I broke up and posted on here as u/GuestJoking I think I had trouble loosening that emotion bond. I'm trying my best, but it still hurts."
1400,isfp,"I broke up with my girlfriend a while ago and it was tough. I just felt, I'm wasting my time. She didn't support me, we didn't have anything in common. We had sex as a solution to her boredom. She worked as a waitress about 40 hours per month for really bad payroll. I just had to move on. I still think about her. She had an impact of how much future GF/Wife should be like. But the break up was awful. She would call me few times a day and sometimes she would come to my home door..."
1401,isfp,"Yeah, I don't get the impression that it's very easy to switch off emotions like that even if you were no longer happy with the relationship.
The last time I talked to my ex, she claimed that I never realised she was depressed during the relationship, and I suppose towards the end when I broke up with her.
I remember ISFPs, or enneagram 9s hating the idea of being abandoned."
1402,isfp,"Yep, I think I've basically been cut off now. My ex acted like she is completely indifferent to me, said that she binned all the mementos that I had given her over the last 6 years.
In all honesty, I found it hard to believe, part of me just thinks this is her way of protecting herself. 
Then again, my ex is in a new relationship after 5 months, she says she is a lot happier now and I believe that. But I find it difficult to believe she has absolutely no feelings left for me."
1403,isfp,"Lot of breakups are caused by one side or both sides suffering depression. Depression is such a thing that, it kills the character in you, it sucks the the life juice out of you, makes you less lovable, less intelligent, clouds your judgment, it makes you appear like a different person, the things i just said also cause break ups. This is not random.
We are ignorant about what others feel like most of the time, ignorant of what causes them to act shitty, unlike themselves, and we can't deal with it, we give up. The right move is to see the cause of all this change, which is depression.
Sadly solving depression is not an easy thing, i simply don't have a linear strategy to approach to solving it."
1404,isfp,"Loved Math, it was one of the few classes I could easily pick up. That and physics which is just math science. Math has always been easy to me but I'm not really sure if that's a personality thing. I'm pretty skeptical when it comes to thinking of a certain personality types strengths in school. (I suck at art and I'm not creative)  "
1405,isfp,"I liked math when I already knew the theory and you just had to solve a problem and you felt like a detective. It was so fulfilling.
What I absolutely hated was studying the theory with 100 phrases to explain one thing that is obvious"
1406,isfp,"It was boring and astoundingly rote.  Also very restrictive - something which would not appeal to this type.
Think about it.  English: here's some rules, here's a subject, go write a few pages.
Math: do these 100 problems by tomorrow.  They're solved in one of these three ways: _____
I could understand limited appeal but the repetition really grates on you by the time college comes around."
1407,isfp,"My favorite classes are the math, science, and computer science courses. Art is probably my least favorite because I can‚Äôt draw what my brain imagines, my hands won‚Äôt allow it. I know good art when I see it, I just can‚Äôt create it. "
1408,isfp,"I'd partially agree.  I think it can somewhat dictate interest but yes, not necessarily skill.  Excessively extroverted activities are generally not going to be of much interest to an introvert for example, and going too far outside that reach may even turn into agony for an extended period of time.
Basically: extroverts are not gunning for librarian positions.
I didn't have any problem with math either, mostly A's and B's, but there are certain aspects of how it has to be taught which tend to be unappealing to ISFP, namely: the lack of freedom in arriving at answers, repetition, volume of work required (by far it generated the most homework), etc.  I was sick of it after awhile.  I'm sure at higher levels it may get more freeing but the initial courses are tedious.
I suck at art and I'm not directly responsible for creating things, yet I ended up in a creative field.  Those things can all coincide with each other."
1409,isfp,"I don't know if this is because of Se or whatever, but every time I sit down and eat I literally can't stop because I enjoy the taste of food so much. It'll get to the point where I'm uncomfortably full, and at that point I force myself to stop. Anybody else experience something similar?"
1410,isfp,"i definitely eat out of boredom, for similar reasons. (the taste is incredible to the point where sometimes i just want to experience flavour) but i'm decent at controlling myself and don't eat large quantities in single sittings. i'm a small snacks throughout the day kinda dude."
1411,isfp,"I‚Äôm the complete opposite! I struggle to feel hungry at the ‚Äúright‚Äù times (breakfast, lunch etc). Especially if I‚Äôm concentrating at work, I won‚Äôt eat until dinner.  I also struggle to eat a whole meal in one sitting and will have to put it to the side to finish later. "
1412,isfp,"Yes! Not so much quantity but frequency, for me. I snack a lot at work. Engaging the senses with something interesting (taste or texture or temperature-wise) helps keep my mind on task when the work itself is not particularly interesting. But also yeah, if it's tasty it's hard to stop."
1413,isfp,"For some reason everyone constantly says ExTPs are extremely charming and hard to dislike, but I find that they're not charismatic at all. If anything, they seem rather creepy in general. Mature ones are just alright, though."
1414,isfp,I generally find ENTPs as annoying edgelords and ESTPs greasy and pervy :/ Both also egotistical if immature. I had to call an ESTP friend-of-a-friend today and their voicemail message was an entire monologue of their whole life. 
1415,isfp,"I am an ENTP, and I definitely wouldn't consider myself charming. I'm witty, and I have the skills that are usually associated with being charming, but I never really put much effort into that type of thing. Usually I come across as really funny, unique, and eccentric, which definitely isn't considered charming by most people out there. Along with that, I do have that stereotypical ENTP problem with randomly starting debates about stupid (and often controversial) crap, and then finding some credible bullcrap I can use to argue it (they stand there and look at me like I'm stupid, but they can't find a good way to prove me wrong). Honestly, the charming stereotype seems pretty off, at least for ENTPs. Healthy ones sometimes come across as charming, but the majority of us don't usually give that vibe."
1416,isfp,"I'm here from the ENTP raid. Lol
ENTP's are energetic idea generators that use logic to try and discover things. It's my experience that isfps do not like to engage in banter, fast-paced conversation or speaking in analytical ways.
The ones that I know are more concerned about sticking to what's true about themselves and speaking about their opinions in a very subjective way that makes it difficult for you to say something without feeling like you're telling them that they are wrong in their experience is not valid.
To be fair I have one of my closest friends that might be an isfp and we grew apart in college and we learned how to communicate and have always been really close and more so and post-college
I also think that the isfps do not speak their mind fully or they don't think out loud which makes for slow going with entps"
1417,isfp,"I don‚Äôt generally have strong opinions about ExTPs, simply because they are so different from myself, so I don‚Äôt generally know any of them all that well. I love IxTPs though, but mostly because they tend to be overly awkward and detached, and I think it‚Äôs kind of cute tbh."
1418,isfp,"As an ENTP I feel the best way to describe it‚Äôs like being charismatic but never charismatic enough to get anything I want. There‚Äôs definitely certain social things that come pretty easy to me, as others in the thread have said I tend to come off as pretty unique and I‚Äôm a pretty good speaker and pretty open and honest. So yeah these things all lend me to be pretty charming or at least charismatic in the right moments. But I‚Äôve never got the impression that it was ever enough to get me anything or confirm that I‚Äôd win anybody over. I find that oftentimes I just feel out of place and like I‚Äôm too scared to take certain risks. I think the people who are impressed by me are just impressed that I‚Äôd say certain things. To me the shit I say isn‚Äôt a risk, I really just don‚Äôt care to hide certain things about me so being confident then isn‚Äôt hard. So yeah is their charm there? Sure. Do some just find it creepy? Definitely. Always feel like I‚Äôm in this middle zone and I just wish I could cross it."
1419,isfp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/entp] An Ego Check from r/ISFP

¬†^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
1420,isfp,"I would call ENTPs charismatic, as a presumptuous generalization, as opposed to charming. 
They often have magnetic personalities, but recall that magnets are polarized - as such, ENTPs tend to be polarizing. 
I do speak as an ENTP-A. "
1421,isfp,"The thing is that ENTP's don't start debates for the sake of it. They do play the devil's advocate but that is somehow antithetical to debating.
There's a difference between presenting bullcrap as arguments and poking holes on them. I doubt the possibility of an ENTP using bullshit while discussing, since they care about being accurate. Perhaps the ideas of an ENTP individual might look as bullcrap to the general public but that's substantially different."
1422,isfp,"Read enneagram 4 which should correlate to a lot of isfps
I knew one who was unhealthy 4 or below. He'd never talk logically. Only in character and being himself whatever that meant.
So strike 1 can't talk with him discuss debate or learn. Just doof around and say meaningless crap.
I can get along with him but I'd have to not talk about what interests me really. Just read enneagram 4 and you can see why someone who's an ENTP who loves discussing ideas and uses logic a lot will just end up rubbing someone who is artsy fartsy and not logical will be somewhat limited.
This is a bit scattered but it makes a lot of sense that your Three Brothers won't like your husband or that they don't click"
1423,isfp,"It's a bit hard to put a finger on, but I find that ExTPs (ENTPs in particular) just behave rather strangely and seemingly random to me. From what they say and how they say things, to their way of thinking.. it just seems somewhat off to me."
1424,isfp,"I think it is precisely this randomness (see my username, lol :D) that plays into the disconnect between ISFPs and ENTPs. It is too far from reality and the present. Can you give an example of what they say that is off with you?"
1425,isfp,I can tell we're not your cup of tea. :D But there are some unhealthy or misdeveloped ENTPs that behave in weird ways that are unhealthy for themselves and others. Steer away from them and give the rest a chance.
1426,isfp,"My interpretation:
Bipolar? Or maybe the two sides of human. Good and bad, or left brain/ right brain (nice brain representation!) ... where on one side, worms (symbolising rot) turning into caterpillars and butterfly(s) (symbolising metamorphosis and change). On the 'bad' side you have depersonalization ... where life is almost unreal, or like a simulation, and everything is meaningless (1s and 0s, like in a computer). On the other side, sunshine and clouds/ flowing water ... symbolising abundance/plenty, in contrast to the murky waters on the 'dark' side. An eye symbolising intuition .. or Ni, maybe? (An Eye/ N-I, geddit? lol). And in the midst of all this, the far reaching arms of Satan!!!! (goat, traditionally symbolising satan ... from Christian symbolism, as in, the sheep and goats etc etc).

Nice drawing BTW, I love ISFP art, you guys are the bestest."
1427,isfp,"I see it like a balance kind of picture, the light and the dark. I noticed something resembling words, so maybe the thoughts vs the clarity of our minds? And us as the center, the natural core? I‚Äôm just throwing ideas out there, but that‚Äôs a vague interpretation of mine "
1428,isfp,Cool interpretation! Yeah you might be onto something.  Several months ago i had psychosis that involved delusions that were going between extreme nihilism and extreme spirituality and this is kinda finally venting some of the scary ominous weirdness.
1429,isfp,"So true. One night I was drinking heavily with a friend in NYC and on the way back to the apartment we passed a couple walking their dog. I remember getting down on my knees and petting it, while it licked me all over my face and mouth.

1432,isfp,"Hey fellow ISFP‚Äôs
Just thought I could share this with you because it kind of bothers me and I sometimes question my identity because of it.
I‚Äôm having a hard time trying to find the right words because my English is not the best...blablabla but I try my best. Feel free to correct me :D
It‚Äôs just that, when I think something or someone‚Äòs behavior is cool (in my own and unique perception of ‚Äûcool‚Äú ) I kind of adopt it.
Maybe some examples are helpful‚Ä¶
‚Äã

When I first watched the movie Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets I thought it was cool that Ron is such afraid of spiders and so I talked myself into fearing spiders although I actually thought they were kinda funny / interesting. Ever since that I indeed was afraid of spiders... Until that day two years ago when I realized that ticks are much scarier‚Ä¶but I was afraid of spiders for 10 years because of a movie!! That‚Äôs not normal... or is it?

‚Äã

I‚Äôve never been into science fiction / superheroes or other geeky stuff like that until an ex of my sister tried to persuade her into watching Star Wars with him and I thought ‚Äúhey, most girls don‚Äôt like that stuff, let‚Äôs give it a try, I wanna be cool, I wanna be different‚Äù.

Before that I was one of those who said Star Wars and Star Trek is the same thing and actually thought that all of this stuff was stupid. After watching Star Wars for the first time I still thought it was stupid but I was able to talk myself into loving it, re-watching it three or four times and now I can proudly say I own (among a lot of others) all the Star Wars movies on blu-ray (and a huge collection of comics etc.) and I‚Äôd like to punch people in the face who say Star Trek and Star Wars is the same thing. There is nothing better than discussing with my boyfriend in what order we watch the movies.
These are just examples, I‚Äôm trying to say I love stuff like that now and I know more about it than the average ‚ÄúI like Marvel because everybody is into it now‚Äù person.
‚Äã

Memoirs of a Geisha is one of my favorite movies and I fell in love with the culture of Japan. When I first tried sushi I gagged because it was such an awful taste and I really couldn‚Äôt swallow a bit of it. But I said to myself ‚Äúyou are a japan-fan, you must love sushi‚Äù (which is bullshit, I know) and I tried again and again and by this time I love sushi.

Maybe that‚Äôs not the best example to explain what I mean but it also describes how intensively I can talk myself into something.
‚Äã
I could give you more examples but this is already a pretty long text and I think you already get what I‚Äôm trying to say.
The question that bothers me regarding all this is ‚Äúam I truly authentic?‚Äù
I perceive myself as pretty ‚Äúcool‚Äù but is that really me?"
1433,isfp,"Me too, man. Star Trek is clearly superior in every way.
Other than that, I can‚Äôt relate to your post fr. But who knows."
1434,isfp,"Haha yeah basically you‚Äòre right but I think you can‚Äòt actually compare them.
Maybe I just needed time to change my pre-existing opinion which I got from my parents, who never were into sci-fi. Neither were friends of mine back then so I had to find out on myself that it‚Äòs pretty cool. You need to find it at least interesting before trying something new after all, don‚Äôt you. And the first person I met who said it was cool was just the trigger I needed to try it out. Maybe it was shit the first time but after all I must have liked it enough to give it another chance..and started to love it in the end. Maybe I‚Äòm just overthinking how I became who I am today. idk"
1435,isfp,"I value my paintings in that a lot of emotional energy goes into creating them. I spend around 20 hours on each one which takes a week or two.  When I look at the finished product I feel the value of every second spent, every thought I had while painting it, every podcast listened to during the process and whatever profound life events occurred during that time. I'm more of a photocopier sort of painter than a creative artist so I can't imagine how anyone else would get any emotional value from my work. Regardless, people seem to like them and that's a big motivator for me to keep painting."
1436,isfp,"Yeah i care about the impression my art makes. If people appreciate it then i feel like my effort was worth it. If they don't, it really upsets me and i guess that's why people say ""isfp's art are everything to them"""
1437,isfp,"Well most of the time I take photos for my own satisfaction. So having a final product im satisfied with and proud of is important. But this changes when I print. When I print a photo it's meant to be shared with somebody specific, this isn't something a couple followers will glance at for a few seconds, this is a photo of the subject, and it's ment to be special to them.  So kind of going off what OP said, when I'm making a photo for somebody else, what's important isn't how great I did; it's the emotions caused when I give this person a photo of themselves that's so much better than some school year book photo or a selfie or whatever. The value of my art is the 'wow' in a person's eyes when they see the outcome I give them"
1438,isfp,"I'm not really wild about it to be honest. My main songs right now are probably ""easy"" by son lux, ""The Loser"" by Zach Farache, and ""Coming Home"" by Leon Bridges. I also listen to a lot of hip hop and stuff, but I'm not really sure what to make of this particular genre??"
1439,isfp,"""Easy"" was on replay during my exam times - I love it too!
For some reason I want to dance to ""The Loser"" with a lover and I would enjoy listening to ""Coming Home"" in a park during the summer. Thank you"
1440,isfp,"ENFP here, with an ISFP brother and dated an ISFP before. I love your type - I think that in some ways they compliment me so well. We have a lot of the same values but we see the world so differently so conversation is never boring. I‚Äôm also insanely attracted to the Se, which is elusive to me. You can talk theoretically with me, but we also have a lot of fun adventures. But the thing that breaks my heart is how independent you are. At the end of the day, you and your own happiness comes first. I don‚Äôt fault you for it at all, but maybe because we don‚Äôt always want the same things, I find it sad that you would not often make sacrifices for someone else. For example, the ISFP guy I dated, I just had the impression that what he wanted the most was freedom and the ability to do anything whenever he wanted. One day we‚Äôd be so in love, the next he‚Äôd want to move to France and not even think of how I would feel. As my brother gets older, I start to see that as well. We used to do everything together and I love him so much. But he recently told me that he wants to explore the world to see which place felt the most like him and to live there. I want to do that as well, but family is also really important to me, so I‚Äôd probably sacrifice being in a place where I felt most at all in order to be closer to the people I love. But I know my brother wouldn‚Äôt care. He fundamentally sees himself as alone in the world anyway so his happiness is most important to him. When we agree to work on a long term project together I‚Äôve learned to never expect him to follow through because he will always inevitably decide he would rather do something else halfway through without thinking about how much I need to finish the project we started because I need it to make money or something else. I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that neither ISFP felt very reliable. 
I consider myself a pretty independent person, but the ISFPs in my life often make me sad. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm generalizing, especially because I have ISFP friends who are married and happy and probably have to make some compromises. I‚Äôm happy to be proven wrong and would love to hear your insights.
Edit: I think a lot of people are misunderstanding me and thinking that I want you guys to change. I don‚Äôt - I was just expressing my own sadness and wanting to understand more."
1441,isfp,"ISFP who dated an ENFP here - though I was typed as INTP when I was with him.
I know you mean well. But you‚Äôve got it all wrong. What works for you might not work for us. My ex said the exactly same thing that you did in your post - that I was ‚Äúmissing out on a lot of happiness‚Äù by not prioritizing people as much as he did, and it just made me feel .. guilty for not feeling that way (even though I‚Äôm not that way). So I tried to live that life and I bent over backwards to please him, but I became the unhappiest I‚Äôd ever been being surrounded by people I didn‚Äôt 100% believe in (even though they were nice or whatever). I guess I have really high standards.
Personally I think it‚Äôs somewhat narrow-minded to expect someone to love and appreciate other people‚Äôs company as much as you do, and to insist that that‚Äôs where ‚Äútrue happiness‚Äù lies, when in reality, only we know what‚Äôs best for ourselves. 
I‚Äôm not bothered by your type ‚Äúneeding‚Äù people, as long as you find other people who feel that way and you form your own group that don‚Äôt pester ISFPs for affection.
I‚Äôm bothered when your type wants and expects me to be the same way, and react negatively when I‚Äôm not (like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sad for you guys...‚Äù What‚Äôs up with that?). Don‚Äôt you like variety? Isn‚Äôt it cool that someone can be so different from you? Watch us from afar, accept what it is, respect our free will, and please go find likeminded ENFP people to bond with.
Not to mention that I think my ENFP ex loved the benefits of having a girlfriend over actually loving me. Like, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think he loved me a lot of course - but all the ‚Äúromantic gestures‚Äù he did, like get me roses and necklaces for any special occasion, felt ironic when our relationship was struggling and I just never really felt.. listened to, or REALLY seen - he was too busy in his own big happy romantic fantasy. It was just me doing everything to be enough - he hardly had to compromise for me at all, and that didn‚Äôt feel right. 
All my closest friends are ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù people who don‚Äôt need others to be happy. But we love each other all the same and would do anything for each other. When we see each other, it‚Äôs not because we‚Äôre lonely, but because we actually wanna see each other. That‚Äôs what makes the bonds I have so genuine, loyal, and special to me. I‚Äôm insanely proud of these few friendships I have.
Anyway, I hope I could change your mind about ISFP independence a little bit."
1442,isfp,"Sheesh... probably not what you want to hear but what you described is exactly me. I‚Äôve had conflicts (if you would call them that) like you just described, before in my life with other loved ones. They said the same thing that you did. 
I wish I could say the right thing. The truth is, I just don‚Äôt get close to people that look to others for a source of their happiness. Of course I want the people I love to be happy but like you said, me and my happiness come first. So everyone seems to be better off when I keep people at an arms distance and just do my own thing on my own terms. It doesn‚Äôt mean that I love anybody any less, just that sometimes it‚Äôs better to support people from a distance rather than up close. "
1443,isfp,"(ISTJ) I think the issue here is that most of the ISFPs that I‚Äôve met consider happiness personal in and of itself.  You cannot MAKE someone happy, just as you cannot make someone love you.  So to try and change themselves or sacrifice for someone else‚Äôs happiness makes no sense.  From what I‚Äôve seen, if and when an ISFP sacrifices something, it is because it‚Äôs their own personal belief that it is simply the right thing to do in that situation, whether that‚Äôs a relationship or what have you. "
1444,isfp,"I think you‚Äôre wanting ISFPs to be something that they fundamentally are not. 
People are who they are no matter what their personality type. You can‚Äôt make them be anything other than who they are. 
Needing people isn‚Äôt a crime, but trying to tell ISFPs that they have to be a certain way otherwise it‚Äôll break your heart? That‚Äôs not going to sit well with them, or anyone really, ISFP or not. 
ISFPs are independent, why would you see that as a negative thing? That independence is a quality that I appreciate about them. 

an ENTJ 
"
1445,isfp,"Hi I‚Äôm an ISFP female, and I‚Äôve gotta say, I can‚Äôt argue what you‚Äôve said, but I can explain why (emotionally) I do what I do. I find that when I‚Äôve been in one spot too long (wether it be in school, work, life in general, where I‚Äôm living, my clothes, etc) I start feeling depressed almost. I get this sense of like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point if I‚Äôm not changing and trying new things.‚Äù This change almost fuels my creativity and happiness. I become this bright person when I get to try something new, however with that being said. I also find myself liking to have something stable in my life. For me it‚Äôs my mom, but for your brother it might be you (I honestly would just communicate this to him, I respect straightforward kind communication so much). As for me in a relationship, I feel like I love adventures, yes, but having that one person to go on them with me is what I love most. ISFP‚Äôs like to be alone together if you know what I mean. As soon as the population in the room reaches about 6-7 I‚Äôm out. "
1446,isfp,"I'm an ISFP married to an ISTJ, and in the beginning it was hard.. like I wanted more freedom.  But, then we had kids... and I guess that is what grounded me.   I dont necessarily mean that in a bad way.   For me, it's just what ended up working out and stablizing me more, even though I daydream about moving crazy places a lot still.  Me and my husband talk about  travelling more when our kids are older or retiring somewhere by the coast.  But, my kids mean so much to me that I'm not sure I would want to be far from them.  
And, my husband understands how much I crave freedom and tries his best to accommodate me and give me an open schedule with little restraints.  It's super sweet of him, and it's how he takes care of me. "
1447,isfp,"There are more factors at play here then personality type.
One clear example is the risk of getting super involved in a relationship. Look at divorce rate and male suicide levels afterwards 17 times higher for men
There are a bunch of smaller problems as well that you can look into and explore. Such as who has the rights to producing children... The father truth be told has no say.
Take all this with a culture that CONSTANTLY says ""all girls are hoes/the same"" and you got yourself a broken dynamic between the sexes
There might be some guy out there for you and I would honestly say hurry up and get married (if that's what you want idk you) because these Dynamics are only going to worsen.
Best of luck"
1448,isfp,"First of all, I don‚Äôt want to change you at all. I‚Äôm just expressing how I feel when you guys act a certain way and trying to understand better, does that make sense? I totally get what you mean and I often feel the same way about inauthentic significant others. I‚Äôm not trying to change you guys at all, and I think the situation you‚Äôre describing is different from what I‚Äôm talking about. I mean ISFPs who just take off without warning. Also, like my brother would tell my dad he‚Äôs coming home, but then decide he doesn‚Äôt want to and not tell him. That makes my dad very upset because he‚Äôs made dinner for him and everything. Can you see where I‚Äôm coming from? 
I‚Äôm not sad for you guys. I personally feel sad when you guys run off and just leave me somewhere without warning when we had talked about doing something different. Does that make sense? What I meant in the later comment was feeling sad that someone said he didn‚Äôt let himself be close to people who relied on others for happiness. I felt like that was sad because you might not be doing something you want to do, you‚Äôre just doing something that you feel like you should do. But if that‚Äôs not the case then that‚Äôs not the case - it would help me understand by just telling me that. I hope that makes sense and I feel bad that I offended you."
1449,isfp,"Out of curiosity, what did you see as the benefits of a relationship?  Do your friends that live and let live make you feel listened to, and do they really see you?  When you saw your ex did you feel like it was just because he was lonely, or that he actually wanted to see you?  Sorry if that's personal, I'm not sure how else to word it :)"
1450,isfp,"Aw, don‚Äôt do that :) I think that in some ways your losing out on a lot of happiness. There‚Äôs got to be a way to make all parties happy. I‚Äôm sure lots of isfps have families and obligations and are still happy!
Edited to add: Argh I‚Äôm so annoyed that this comment was misunderstood. I meant that it would be sad if u/vodkablossoms keep people at an arms length just because s/he‚Äôs afraid of disappointing or hurting others - NOT that I‚Äôm trying to change him/her. I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs sad because I don‚Äôt like the idea of someone not doing something that they want to do just because of fear and probably misunderstanding. But if that‚Äôs not the case, and it feels like a choice you‚Äôve made, then I‚Äôm fully supportive."
1451,isfp,"Thanks! That makes a lot of sense to me and I understand completely, especially because my brother and I are super close so we talk a lot and I get where he‚Äôs coming from. It‚Äôs just weird to me that at the end of the day, he‚Äôd be willing to leave it all and move somewhere in the middle of nowhere away from all his friends and family. And I‚Äôm not trying to stigmatize or judging that at all, just stating how I feel about it. Maybe he likes the idea of it, but he wouldn‚Äôt actually do it or enjoy it. Or maybe he‚Äôd go do it and then feel lonely and come back it he‚Äôs not thinking that far ahead right now. What do you think?"
1452,isfp,"I am not trying to change them, I‚Äôm trying to understand them. And I was just trying to express myself. I‚Äôm not sure why everyone is so up in arms and it‚Äôs frustrating me that I can‚Äôt communicste it properly. I‚Äôm not saying they have to be a certain way or it breaks my heart, I‚Äôm just saying that the way they are sometimes breaks my heart and I‚Äôm trying to understand it better. Oftentimes I get sad or hurt because I don‚Äôt understand the intentions behind a persons actions because they‚Äôre so different from me, does that make sense?"
1453,isfp,hahah I really don't want to get married right away - probably play right into the ENFP stereotype that I like to explore my options for a long time before settling down. I don't think I agree that the dynamics between genders are worsening. I generally have a great relationship with men - most of my closest friends are guys probably because I grew up with two brothers. I think I wrote this last night in the heat of the moment when my brother just went off and did his own project instead of working on a project that we were supposed to be working on because we needed to for practical reasons and I felt so frustrated and hurt and I felt like if I understood things from his point of view I would be less upset. 
1454,isfp,"Oooo I see. That dinner thing you mentioned, I‚Äôve done similar semi-selfish things growing up to my mother. I just didn‚Äôt realize the things she did for me. I think I still struggle with that in our relationship now. 
Personally it feels more like a maturity issue than anything else; my communication now is pretty amazing and if I‚Äôve made plans with people that I mysteriously never followed up on, it either wasn‚Äôt intentional at all (forgetfulness?) or I have plans to make up it up to them later. 
Is your brother going through something that he might not be telling you about ? If he‚Äôs repeatedly ditching or vanishing, the cause could be something else completely. If he‚Äôs doing it purposely he might be sending you guys a message to leave him alone for whatever reason. It‚Äôs his right whether or not he shares it with you, or course, but when ISFPs are in bad places we become especially moody, bitter, and cynical. 
If you‚Äôve already expressed to him that his sudden disappearances are really harming your family relationship, and he still does it, then there might be something more serious going on here. That, or he‚Äôs just immature and needs to work on it."
1455,isfp,"Benefits of a relationship.. I know that there were probably enough benefits to keep me in that relationship at the time, but it feels so long ago now that I can‚Äôt really remember. Lol.
Near the end of the relationship he‚Äôd unintentionally ignore how I really needed the relationship to change for me or else I couldn‚Äôt stay in it but it never happened so it didn‚Äôt work out. That‚Äôs why I ultimately didn‚Äôt feel listened to. 
Again, I have no doubt in my mind my ex loved me very, very much. But the things he‚Äôd say would unintentionally make me feel that he was only in it for having a girlfriend  - ‚ÄúWhen I was single I felt like I was missing something and you‚Äôve filled it in for me‚Äù. Or that he said he was always ‚Äúmeant to be in a relationship‚Äù when I definitely didn‚Äôt feel the same way.
I remember that alternatively it made him insecure that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù a relationship like he did (that I was fine/happy when I was single). 
My friends make me feel listened to, yes. I feel a sense of home in these platonic relationships because they‚Äôre so naturally well-intentioned. Our friendships are totally selfless and accepting of each other and I‚Äôm fortunate to have these people as friends. 
Edit: But general benefits of being in a relationship are pretty obv, like having someone who cares about you, sharing experiences together, cuddles, etc etc"
1456,isfp,"I think it would depend entirely on where he found himself and what the experience was like.   
My ISFP best friend is now in his fifties.  He spent a lot of time traveling in his younger years and didn‚Äôt get married or settle down until he was 40 and decided he wanted a family.  But while he gets short trips still, he was missing the month long excursions in the wilderness.  He recently spent a year planning to hike/climb to the top of the Andes mountains, like he used to do.  He did practice hikes, each one longer than the last. Last month was the time and he went.  After four days, he was missing his family, realized that his heart wasn‚Äôt in it and went home.  He‚Äôs reconciled to the fact that his priorities have changed.  But he needed that freedom to work it out on his own.   
FWIW, I think ISFPs are explorers in their younger years and that it takes a while for them to want to put down roots, and even then they will need a partner who doesn‚Äôt try to tie them down. "
1457,isfp,"I think it‚Äôs because you didn‚Äôt clarify in your original post that you‚Äôre trying to understand them, it came across as you‚Äôre upset because ISFPs won‚Äôt be the way you wish they would be. 
If the way they are breaks your heart and makes you so genuinely sad then I think you would be better off looking for people who share more of your values, that would be more reasonable, no? It sounds like ISFPs are possibly too different than yourself, they have a different set of values that contradict your own. It sounds like their need for independence clashes too much with you and your own needs. "
1458,isfp,"Totally get what you mean! I think it's important to see what's out there first
While it is a slow progression, you have to at least agree with the music/pop culture argument right?
I see guys around me (not on the intranet) making these arguments more and more. I would be extra careful and to definitely get to the root of why this one failed regardless of what it was
Good luck"
1459,isfp,"I don't think he's going through something, I think it's just the way he is. Reading others' perspectives made me remember that he often does come around to it after reflecting on his own a bit so hopefully that will happen. Anyways, thanks for your help!"
1460,isfp,"Oooh, this makes a lot more sense and I totally relate to that.  It sounds a lot like your ex was kind of unhealthy codependent-y, it might be gushy romantic to say things like ""you complete me"" but if somebody actually feels that way then imho they ought to look into loving themselves before they can love others.  Loneliness is the poverty of self; solitude is the richness of self.  Thanks for sharing."
1461,isfp,"That sucks, I'm sorry. It sounds like you really tried and if it were me on the other end I would have appreciated the effort very much. 
I feel like he might have meant that being in a relationship was part of the perks of being with you - not the only part. Like he's just someone who likes being with other people, but it's not like he'd be with anyone. At least that's not how I feel. Do you feel like you weren't special to him? Do you feel like that was a dealbreaker or that other things compounded on your decision not be with him?
‚Äã"
1462,isfp,"Do you ever see yourself settling down with someone longterm? What would make you do that? When you say you don‚Äôt get close to people who depend on others for happiness - don‚Äôt you feel like that‚Äôs a natural part of being human? Don‚Äôt you get happiness from other people? That‚Äôs not say you depend on them of course, but I don‚Äôt think I necessarily depend on anyone for happiness either. Maybe we have different understandings of that phrase."
1463,isfp,"Thanks - I just clarified - hopefully that helps. Yeah, I understand, but I think it‚Äôs worth trying to understand them because we get along so well in other regards. I would be missing out on a lot by not letting them in my life, if that makes sense. My brother and I are best friends, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world. Thanks again for your help!"
1464,isfp,"Thanks. Can you elaborate on the music/pop culture argument? I'm not sure I completely understood you the first go around. And what argument are the guys around you making? 
The ISFP guy was just getting over a serious breakup (but he didn't tell me that was the problem, I found out from other people). He just kind of disappeared to try to deal with it on his own. Since then we've become good friends, and I think he's interested in something more, but a part of me knows that we might not ever be compatible and I don't want either of us getting hurt. Something to keep thinking about, I guess. "
1465,isfp,"Yes, this.  I think, though, since ISFPs have a tendency to take words literally, then if the actions are smothery then it triggers panic in thinking their SO actually believes those words.  It's why commercial romance can be really ruin things."
1466,isfp,"Nah I knew I was special to him (he made that clear). And no it wasn‚Äôt the dealbreaker, it was everything else - him ignoring what I needed, his jealousy of my traits, his insecurity, etcetera. Sometimes he‚Äôd also talk down to me like I was stupid without meaning to, despite the fact that he and I both know I had my shit together more than he did. (He later apologized and told me he did it because he was insecure.)
I‚Äôm glad we broke up because I got to casually see other people, get physical with other people, etc. and just generally experience more that I couldn‚Äôt have if I was with him. I remember the fact that he wouldn‚Äôt even consider an open relationship even though we were SO young and were each other‚Äôs first everythings, being kind of a turn off also. (I wanted to experience what it was like to mingle with other people, he didn‚Äôt.)
Otherwise he was a very loving boyfriend and I don‚Äôt regret being with him, I just don‚Äôt think we were right for each other.
Funny enough he tried to follow me on IG last week even though we hadn‚Äôt spoken since 2016. Not to be cold, but I have no interest in having him re-enter my life so I blocked him."
1467,isfp,"I guess so, if someone gave me enough space and didn‚Äôt expect too much from me (and I would do the same for them ofc) then maybe but it‚Äôs hard to find people like that lol. 
I don‚Äôt know if feeling happy from other people is for everyone. No doubt it is for some, probably most people, but I don‚Äôt agree with this notion that it‚Äôs the norm, I feel like it inadvertently otherizes people who don‚Äôt feel this way (not saying that you were doing that, just stating how I feel about it). I don‚Äôt think I get happiness from others. I mean I love the people in my life very much, and I want them in it, but they aren‚Äôt the reason why I‚Äôm happy‚Äîor unhappy for that matter! 
I think some ISFPs find what they want and they settle but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always a person necessarily‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs a place or a thing or something else. "
1468,isfp,"I‚Äôm not saying you have to be like others at all. I‚Äôm just trying to understand what it feels like to be you, when I feel like it‚Äôs so different from what I understand. Also, maybe I was feeling a bit defensive when you said that people like me look to others for happiness as we‚Äôre dependent or something and I just wanted to point out that I feel like everyone derives happiness from others in some way - right? Happy to be proven wrong, again. 
Also, based on the downvotes, I feel like people are reading my tone as trying to change you guys or something. I‚Äôm just asking questions to better understsnd, not trying to prove a point."
1469,isfp,"I know you didn‚Äôt mean it that way. And I‚Äôm sorry that I made it seem like you were dependent on others. I certainly didn‚Äôt mean it that way. If it makes you feel any better, the derivation of happiness from others is something I don‚Äôt understand about a lot of people myself. We both have a lot to learn, it seems like! 
I still disagree that everyone derives happiness from others in some way, though. I‚Äôll use my experience as an example, because it‚Äôs all I know.
I‚Äôm happiest pursuing my projects‚Äîmy art and my music. Other things, like being out in nature and going on runs make me happy too. But mostly my projects make me happy, and they never really include people. At all. I don‚Äôt even need to show others my work‚Äîjust doing it makes me happy. If I‚Äôm satisfied with it, that‚Äôs all I care about. If someone wants to be around while I‚Äôm working on these things, if they want to see the outcome, then that‚Äôs fine I guess. But it‚Äôs completely inconsequential to how I feel. I could do these things without them and feel fine. Conversely, I‚Äôm unhappy when my projects don‚Äôt turn out how I want them to or if I can‚Äôt get any creative juices flowing‚Äînot when people are around or not around. 
I hope that gives you some perspective. I know you weren‚Äôt trying to change anyone. Honestly it didn‚Äôt even come off that way to me lol. But the point is that happiness doesn‚Äôt always come from one place, and it‚Äôs not the same for everyone. That‚Äôs exactly why I keep people at an arms distance‚Äîbecause I understand this. I don‚Äôt want to be unhappy by having to sacrifice time/energy away from my projects, and I don‚Äôt want to make others unhappy by seeming like they‚Äôre not a priority of mine. It doesn‚Äôt make me sad at all, and it shouldn‚Äôt make you sad either! This is really just a different strokes for different folks situation. I hope this helps you understand. "
1470,isfp,"That makes me feel a lot better, thank you very much. And it really helps to read your example. I guess I meant, if you're out with friends and they make you laugh and they care about you and listen to your problems, do you feel happy? And if that's the case, then doesn't that mean that a person made you happy? And sometimes, don't you want to feel that feeling again and it's only a happiness that you get when you're hanging out with that particular person? That's all I meant by getting happiness from other people. 
‚Äã
I guess what I understand from your example though is that those types of happinesses still pale in comparison to the happiness you get from doing your own projects. Which makes sense to me when I see it that way. "
1471,isfp,That is pretty much it. I experience the happiness you described and I enjoy it but it‚Äôs not the kind that I seek out. The happiness that matters the most from me is the kind I get from creating something I‚Äôm proud of. 
1472,isfp,"Thanks! And as I post this, someone is writing to me about a project I was really excited about doing months ago but he took so long to get back to me that I've moved on to other things and am no longer interested. But I feel really bad and obligated to carry on...yikes. "
1473,isfp,"Dude you need to talk to somebody fr. Your posts indicate you‚Äôre spiraling. I recognize it because I identify with you, and if you‚Äôre having the same kinds of dangerous thoughts I do, then you need to get help like yesterday."
1474,isfp,"I personally have also lost many of my friends but I don‚Äôt regret it much at all. They weren‚Äôt real friends. I considered them with high regard and was not. 
Lucky I have a few friends that are empathic, good people. 
I know things might be tough for you right now, but if you remember someone that cared for you, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to reach out. The best thing you can do it be brave and contact someone. Catch up with coffee or other beverage and you‚Äôll likely find that it isn‚Äôt turning out as poorly as you thought and it‚Äôs much more fun than you thought. And that you missed them more than you thought. The feeling would probably be mutual.
Good luck, OP. We will always be here to lend our ears and eyes. "
1475,isfp,"yeah. the people i wish i were still friends with haven't been in my life for like six months ish now, and i don't try to maintain a relationship with any of the friends i do see. but i don't have any regrets, it's my own fault that i didn't try and save our friendship and it was a choice i made, same with not connecting with the people who are actually in my life nearly as much as i should. during this time i've learned a lot and i'm starting to stop shutting everyone out. i don't believe in fate but i like the phrase everything happens for a reason, cause that's just how the universe works. life moves forward and you're in control over where you go. you've been given the opportunity for self reflection and making new friends, it won't happen overnight, but being depressed won't solve anything. go out and do stuff whenever you have the opportunity, and make online friends (discord chats, online video games, etc.)"
1476,isfp,"yeah, im in the process of losing all my friends. Figuring out that you're being lied to about how much your closest friends like you is one of the most heart-breaking feelings in the world. Only really have 1 friend that I consider close now :/"
1477,isfp,This is exactly how I feel. I treasure my friendships too much and put way too much time into them. I just dont have the means to have more than like four friends. When I have too many I just feel awful all the time because I wish I could devote more time everyone. It also doesn't help that I already devote a lot of time to myself.
1478,isfp,"You need to count yourself as a friend!!! Take in all of your senses. Go on a hike by yourself. Pray and meditate. Know your likes and dislikes! 
Don‚Äôt feel guilty for people falling off.  It means at the end of it, you‚Äôre surrounded by your favorite people. The ones that encourage you and truly make you the happiest!!! "
1479,isfp,"Personally, I kinda view it as humor or a message made by assholes. I could be wrong and there may be exceptions, but from what I've seen satire always has a really snarky, nasty ""holier than thou"" undertone. It's basically a really indirect way of shitting on something.
I'm also kinda bad at picking up on it, although I've been getting much better at it."
1480,isfp,When people over done it it just made them look like whiny little bitches that are constantly complaining. Specially when they are really making it obvious with their tone. The best kind of satire is done when pointed out in an innocent or neutral way imo. 
1481,isfp,I think you lost me. Why else should humor exist if it isn't funny or entertaining?
1482,isfp,"It depends how you define crush. .. I can have little crushes on a lot of guys simultaneously, kinda like an extrovert would. I don't act on it, I control myself, but I almost always have a crush on at least one person if not more. "
1483,isfp,"Oh god, I'm horrible with crushes. They'll pretty much consume my entire life. I'm in a great relationship now but I'm still prone to crushes, though I won't act on them. I am definitely picky though. "
1484,isfp,"While on a personal level I tend to clash with unhealthy ENTPs the most, I find them easy to deal with irl since they aren't quite as aggressive as ESTPs. I've had a few approach me throughout the years and sarcastically pretend to be my friend, and I either just play along and abandon them when I get the chance or outright ignore them and leave. Works well enough. Online they're a bigger problem, but I find that just ignoring them is for the best, since from what I understand they thrive on attention (tert Fe).
Unhealthy ESTPs are the opposite. Online they're relatively easy to deal with since they don't bite as hard with words as ENTPs do, but damn irl they're easily the worst kind of organism you can encounter. You know them, for example the group of high school kids who bike past you, shout ""faggot"" or something similar at you and then laugh like a total douchebag. Very aggressive, confrontational people. They're really hard to ignore, because if you do they tend to resort to physical acts, like blocking your way, throwing stuff at you, shouting, etc. Really, is there anything you can do with them? I haven't figured it out. I also feel like I'm a magnet for unhealthy ESTPs (it doesn't help that I'm autistic, I guess, makes me extra sensitive to things like shouting, which they find funny for some reason), they're easily the type I encounter most often."
1485,isfp,"Don't react. I think us ISFP really need to work on our self control. If we can master the art of self control and discipline, then there is no stopping us:) 
It sounds like the people you are around enjoy getting a reaction out of you so you must not react(i know this is veryyyy hard trust me!) Right now I'm trying to use self control to not care what others think of or say to me. I tried it yesterday at work and it's amazing how different my day went!
Being an ISFP is a blessing and a curse! We care so much but that is also a curse as well as a blessing!"
1486,isfp,"I mean I can‚Äôt say much about those types specifically. Not that I don‚Äôt encounter them, but I can‚Äôt say I really know any. At least not to a degree I‚Äôm actually associated with them.
Though I guess that‚Äôs an answer in itself - avoidance. Sometimes at my work I‚Äôll have to work at the till. Which as you can imagine, can bring some rude, confrontational people. My go to solution is just to calmly control myself. I don‚Äôt get angry. I don‚Äôt lose control. I just breathe and deal with them politely.
I get what you mean about how sometimes calm avoidance can bother them and cause them to act worse - but that sounds like a general just bully problem. I‚Äôm not really sure how to deal with that. I did encounter people who made my life super hard in younger school years. Sometimes I would lose control and act in anger or desperation - but that only makes things worse. I was quite young at that time though. I still am young now but eh.
Of course it‚Äôs easier said then done, but practice. When you get confronted just keep a level head. Let them rant, act politely. You have more control over yourself than you believe. You‚Äôll feel incredibly empowered when even in pressured circumstances, you stayed calm and kept control."
1487,isfp,"The first two comments already nailed it.
Another weapon, if the situation allows so, is to pick on their intelligence. Unhealthy EXTPs usually get into a primitive self-defending mode once they get the slightest clue something is wrong about their view of world because they can't keep their aux Ti stable. Also, replace ""I"" with ""everybody"" because collective statements always do the trick with Fe. Even though they might not admit it at first, they do care what the majority wants.
Hope you'll never get in such a situation. Good luck, an ENTP."
1488,isfp,"don't protect yourselves, the only way to encounters aggression is the aggression itself. I think the way to being more aggressive is to being suffered first, so then your anger keep containing and containing, then boom! To counter the EXTPs aggression is take the superiority in the aggressive term."
1489,isfp,"Hi,
I am an INFJ male. I noticed recently that I am always attracted to ISFP females. Trying to understand why? Even a few close friends during college years were ISFP.
My sister is an ISFP, and though I can definitely feel the lack of S<--
Most of the girls I have been attracted to, I now notice have been ISFPs.
Don't know what that is which attracts me, maybe the cuteness with the non-conformist attitude. Warmth. Frankness, gentle while being edgy!
So wanted a few words of advice from you ISFPs:


What do you in general think about INFJ males? Do you like them?


How can I get to know an ISFP on a personal level? It seems they are always on with their group of friends? 


Are friends more important to ISFPs or close intimate relationships?

"
1490,isfp,"Hello good sir! How are you?
Anyway, I'll try to answer your questions as best as I can (keep in mind answers I provide won't necessarily apply to everyone).
1: I've only known one INFJ male and I got pretty close to him. I was attracted at a couple points in my time talking to him, but as time went on I personally felt he was not someone I was very compatible with. Personally, I believe this to be due to the fact that I had trouble relating to him on an emotional level, and he honestly treated me like complete shit for quite some time in my life (that won't necessarily be a problem for you, just trying to explain why I feel this way).
2: I would say the best way to get to know an ISFP is directly engaging in conversation with them. If you're friends on Facebook, try sending them a message. If you seem generally interested in who they are as people, you'll get a positive response. I know that a lot of us on here enjoy talking about art we're passionate about.
3: I most definitely find close relationships to be more meaningful. I like having friends who I can hang out with and have fun, but at the end of the day I enjoy being able to talk about deep concepts and emotions with a close friend. 
Feel free to reply if you're confused about something, or if you want to ask more questions!"
1491,isfp,"

Haven't met one!  I have an INFJ female friend that I think the world of, very sweet.


Just go ahead and talk to them.  Whether through Facebook/texting/in person.  Don't worry if the ISFP isn't too chatty, it can take awhile for the friendship to really click.  It can take a bit for an ISFP to feel like its okay to trust you.  However, if you're trying really hard to be friends with a certain ISFP and things aren't working out, then maybe it wasn't meant to be.


Close relationships definitely.  It gets tiring trying to juggle friends and acquaintances.

"
1492,isfp,"

It doesn't really matter to me if you're a ENFJ or ISFP or whatever. If you're nice to me, then I'm gonna be attracted to you. Good looks are a bit of a plus, too. Although, since I don't like talking to people first, I haven't liked anyone in a while. 


I guess the same goes for getting to know me. Being nice is the best way to get to me. I love nice people, and I like being nice too. Of course, if you're a stranger, it definitely will take some getting used to. Talking to strangers is a little scary for me, so it's best if you talk to me first.


I'd rather have close friendships than a bunch of friends. Since I do like being nice, I pick up a lot of acquaintances and ""school"" friends (friends I talk to and hang out with at school and ONLY school). I have about four friends that I hang out with and talk to outside of school. And even then, I don't hang out with them that much. Those friends are really important to me, despite the fact I don't socialize that often. 

"
1493,isfp,"Hey thanks so much for your kind reply :)
INFJ's don't really want to treat anyone like shit. I don't know why he was like that. But anyways I ain't like that. But if I am not getting too personal, may I ask what trouble did you face connecting with an INFJ on an emotional level (just on a general basis)?
I've see with my sis (ISFP) that she likes hugs and touches, as signs of affection. Is it true for all ISFPs? As an INFJ I am a bit cold when it comes to touching someone I don't know. But with someone I know I like touching, teasing, etc. How close should one get to an ISFP to start showing physical signs of affection?
Yea, I've talked with other ISFPs, but after sometime, it feels to me, they aren't really paying much attention to me, and to get attention I have to keep talking about their interests. Although I am mostly truly interested in their interests, but I would want some personal attention, besides talking about their interest all the time. How does an ISFP show her personal attention towards someone they like?
It's good to know that ISFPs find close relationships more meaningful. I as an INFJ really think thats a strong connecting point."
1494,isfp,"Me and your sister are pretty similar! I get really touchy feely with friends I'm really close to. I love hugs. They make me feel secure. Sometimes, I just like to touch my friends. Like a soft pat on the head or a tap on their shoulder. I dunno, I just like touching.
It annoys some of my friends sometimes. It can be a little disheartening."
1495,isfp,"Yeah, I do understand that your type doesn't really want to hurt peoples' feelings, seeing as INFJs tend to be incredibly empathetic. I was going through a phase where I was having a lot of issues dealing with belonging, and he detached himself from me as a friend. Whenever I tried to talk to him he was just really empty with his responses and just generally didn't want to talk to me. This led to an increased state of anxiety that plagued me for quite some time. So I guess he wasn't trying to treat me like shit, but we made up about it. 
As far as our connection on an emotional level, it came down to the fact that he was an overall sad person, while I tend to be a more happier person. Whenever we'd engage in a deep conversation about how we feel about something, it'd usually end up with him talking down upon himself. Eventually, I feel like I get worked into a situation where I have very small room to reply with something that takes the conversation somewhere. I used to try and cheer him up, but he would just tell me why I'm wrong about what I'm saying. It seemed no matter what I did the conversation had no where to go (don't know if this will apply to you or whoever you're interested in).
Personally, I'm going to have a bit of trouble answering your question about showing signs of affection. In terms of my sexuality, I find myself to be demisexual, meaning that I don't find people physically attractive, and really only become attracted to someone on a physical level when I form an emotional connection with them. This means that I tend to be very oblivious to when people are interested in others or even interested in me. However, I do know that I enjoy physical forms of attention that are similar to yours.
I don't tend to become infatuated with people very often, but when I am usually I really want to start talking to them a lot. If you are talking about their interests, try throwing things you like about the subject in if you don't already. I mean, while I like to talk about my interests, I'm also interested in what the person who's talking to me is as well. After you get to know them for awhile, try seeing if you can bridge the conversation into some deeper topics? I like it when I'm comfortable talking about more taboo conversations with someone who I know I can trust.
Hope this helps!"
1496,isfp,"I've always had a very clear view of myself. For the past while though I was very anxious around people, constantly worried about how they thought of me. I eventually got (mostly) out of that mindset, but came to the realisation that I have no clue at all how people actually think of me, and most of my anxious years were because I would assume the worst when I didn't know. Is this an ISFP thing? It would kind of make sense, because Fe is nowhere in our stack, but then you would think it would be a very common thing to happen, since 8 out of 16 types don't have it either. Unless it actually is just a very common thing, haha."
1497,isfp,"Interesting. An ISFP friend of mine was telling me the other day about this very phenomenon. I am inclined to pin the blame on inferior Te. There's an oft-neglected parallel between Fe and Te. Te can actually be other-oriented in the same way. What is the nature of your anxiety? What sort of questions are you asking yourself. I'm just spitballing, but I could see inferior Te causing someone to wonder how other people are evaluating them role-wise. As in... I know who I am, but do I really fit in as a cog of the collective machinery? 
As a (possible?) ENTP, I don't relate at all to your idea of having a clear view of myself. At least, I've had to think very hard to come to a place where I feel I have a good vantage point of what, exactly, I'm all about. And with my tertiary Fe, I struggle even to grok what people feel about me, beyond a low-resolution, childish way. 
Kind of fascinating how all of the functions interact, eh? :) "
1498,isfp,"woah this is me. anytime someone asks me a cheesy question like, ""what are three words your friends would use to describe you"" i literally can't give them one. like do i appear shy to them? friendly? mysterious? i have no idea. "
1499,isfp,I think it has to do with your inferior Te that‚Äôs insecure of the possibility of people thinking of you in a negative light. I think it‚Äôs best to let go of that insecurity and realize your strengths. You‚Äôre gonna be okay and I think your strength is helping people overcome thoughts that would ruin their own mood by getting them into a activity in the real world. 
1500,isfp,"I‚Äôve been dating this wonderful ISFP for about four months now and I‚Äôve really fallen for him. His sensuality and laid back nature is unmatched by anyone else I‚Äôve ever been with. I feel like I fall into such a relaxed trance when I‚Äôm with him, forgetting about all my worries and anxieties. As someone who is constantly overthinking everything, this is an amazing feeling. 
Wondering if anyone has opinions on this matching? I feel like we are great for each other and excellent compliments. Often times I have to drag out of him the things he likes about me and us. He would much rather communicate those things using his eyes or body (which he does so well), but I love to hear words every now and again. We both have very busy schedules right now and he makes a consistent effort to come spend time with me, which I really appreciate.
What do you all think about ISFJs? What do you like and dislike? "
1501,isfp,"I'm a 27 year old male ISFP with a 53 year old ISFJ dad. He is a good dad, very stoic though and old fashioned, he believes in traditions and history and the-way-things-are-done, which I absolutely hate.
The things I like about him are the groundedness and stability. I respect the way he puts family before himself and has a strong relation with the community. This is something I could never expect that from myself. I don't operate this way.
ISFP and ISFJ are polar opposites, our priorities are very very different (cognitively). Every function that one has, the other has as shadow functions. In my opinion, there would be a lot of arguments and disagreements, but if there is equal levels of respect (typically ISFJs would find it difficult to respect ISFPs, but also vice versa) then it would be a lot to learn from each other, and you could cover each others weaknesses"
1502,isfp,"Ive been with an isfj female and Im isfp so heres my point of view. In general, it was hard for both of us to open up and communicate freely about our feelings because she needed affirmation, but I did too. We Isfp's also tend to overthink everything and worry. The best solution I see is to make him naturally express more by showing more expression from yourself. He wont do anything out of his comfort zone if he doesnt see it being necessary. Right now he probably is not completely comfortable with expressing everything but itll probably come sooner or later in the future. If you want to step it up though, I would give him affirmation so you could naturally get a response from him."
1503,isfp,"If that relaxed feeling fades what do you have? Honest question
He might still be the same guy but you have more worries now and he can't keep up so then you have nothing to fall back on
It's great you feel this way but you have to plan for more otherwise it could fade.
People, like with food, get caught up in the taste and how it feels but what happens after we eat that whole pizza? Nothing but an empty wallet and diabetes
Tldr Sounds like a good guy, don't just connect in one area"
1504,isfp,"This is the same as my gf (ISFJ) and I (ISFP). I'l try to give you my perspective. 
We fell for each other hard as well, since when we first started dating our lives matched up so well. She's known both by her family members and friends as the ""anxious"" one, but when she's around me she's very lovey-dovey and relaxed. I do make a consistent effort to be with her, and I think the time we spend together is how we tell each other we love each other. I don't tell her often enough how much I like to be around her, which frustrates her sometimes and it seems like you dislike it too lol. Just figure that if I'm hanging around, I'm having a good time. 
In my opinion, I think that there's enough give and take between our personality types to keep the relationship fresh and consistently good. What I have found is the key is expressing how and why we feel a certain way (ASAP) to each other to avoid confrontation"
1505,isfp,"I can see what you mean....I think my dad is also an ISFJ male. I think there is a big difference in the type between male and female though. ISFJ is typically a maternal caring type which I feel like is frowned upon amongst men, especially among older generation. So I think they overcompensated for that by being overly stoic and rule/tradition abiding, which you‚Äôre right, is totally annoying. 
But yes, all our functions are opposites. However, I actually like that....I tend to be drawn to the types that have my shadow functions. 
I also have so much respect for his individuality and free spirit nature....which is quite different from mine. If I was a more traditional person, it might bother me more. "
1506,isfp,"I‚Äôm not sure what you mean....I think we have some common life goals and compatible lifestyles, which is good. Our in person communication is also excellent so we are typically able to work through an issue. But I‚Äôm sure that will get harder with time as the infatuation/love when we are together fades? And perhaps we will start to not cut each other so much slack"
1507,isfp,"I agree. I‚Äôm such an active and direct communicator. But I find that he is far more passive and will pretend he‚Äôs not mad about an issue (when I know he is). But I‚Äôm not going to push for him to discuss it, so I‚Äôm left in a weird position. This problem only arises when we are apart, as when we are together we have a much better read on one another, can judge facial expressions and don‚Äôt make assumptions. When texting about an issue, he tends to assume that I am being rude or angry while I just view that as being direct. I tend to assume he is ignoring me or doesn‚Äôt care, which really pisses me off further. 
I‚Äôm trying to get him to express his thoughts and feelings when they come up, so we can address and fix. 
One problem (and idk if this is individual to him or common with ISFP males) is that sometimes he tries to push his emotion away and puts on this ‚Äúlogical‚Äù front when we are discussing an emotional issue. He will refuse to talk to me on the phone or via text if he feels I‚Äôm being ‚Äúemotional‚Äù and irrational. I feel that I always remain quite measured as I‚Äôve had extremely emotional arguments with my mother who has borderline personality disorder so I know what being overly emotional and irrational is like. Idk if it‚Äôs a masculinity thing where he feels he can‚Äôt be emotional and passionate over these issues bc men ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that‚Äù or what. But I know ISFPs have deep feelings on things so it seems silly to me that he tries to conceal that sometimes. "
1508,isfp,"Let my clarify 
Love is a constant battle just like keeping your head above water, you can tread really well but you always have to put forth the effort
People also confuse love with nervous anxiety or some other grand feeling, all I am saying is to add other feelings and hobbies into the relationship jic one area becomes lackluster
My parents have been together 20+ years and have given me this advice, expand your area of connection in case one fails "
1509,isfp,"In my high school, many subjects have class participation as 20% of your grade. I'm so introverted and have the feeling my answers are going to be wrong, I don't participate much. My past grades are in the B ranges, and I don't feel good about my grades being low just because of that. Any tips?"
1510,isfp,"Try to get over the fear of being wrong. If you just accept it as a possibility, or even an opportunity to learn and grow, you'll feel better. That's the only way I ever got over class participation grades. I realized my fear of being wrong was really the only thing holding me back, so I tried to just not be scared. I know it's not that simple, but it's a place to start. If you just imagine that, hey, if you're wrong, you'll find out, and then you'll never be wrong about that one thing again. You're there to learn, and being wrong is apart of that. I hope it gets better for you, and just know, it's still something I struggle with daily. We're here for you!"
1511,isfp,"This is not counting your participation in group activities? How are your teachers judging class participation? I generally just try to seem engaged during class and answer when I'm called on and contribute to group work, and it seems to have worked out fine so far. But for the life of me I cannot raise my hand when a teacher asks for volunteers. I'd just as soon raise my hand into a bee hive."
1512,isfp,"When I had to volunteer, I tried to pretend I was someone else. It sounds stupid, but, while Jadebolt might be nervous and afraid of being wrong, Jade isn't. Jade is an almighty bitch and she is right because she's Jade. Granted, it took me about a year to not take the entire class period working myself up to volunteer, but it worked out for me. And then eventually I could do it anyway.
I was lucky though, my teachers were the bomb."
1513,isfp,"This is terrible, but I ended up studying more/paying more attention so that I'd be sure I'd have the right answer when I finally chose to participate in class.  The things peer pressure/fear of disappointing your teacher can accomplish...."
1514,isfp,"I had class participation grades, too, and did what you do. Quietly seem engaged, pretend no one sees that book under the desk or in the textbook. If I am put into a social situation or if I'm with my friends, I'm a butterfly. Otherwise, I'll be over here please don't bother me I don't exist. @_@"
1515,isfp,"Think of how many times a teacher has heard a wrong answer. Thats what they are there for. Their asking you is their way of checking if they've done their job right. If you give a wrong answer, they learn that they need to explain things better, or they need to spend a bit more attention on a smaller group of people that the concept didn't ""click"" for. It's not to embarrass you, but it's like a mini-checkpoint in lecture. And, if you happen to get it right, then bonus, unexpected ego boost! "
1516,isfp,"When people bring up examples of real-life ISFPs, they're usually musicians, actors or visual artists. I think that people underestimate the creative writing potential of ISFPs. I would love to hear some examples of ISFP authors and poets, and your reasoning for them being ISFP. How can the unique strengths of the ISFP be applied to the written word?"
1517,isfp,"While I cant off the top of my head give you an example of ISFP poets, I just wanted to throw this thought out there. For the longest time whenever I took an MBTI test and I hit on a question about enjoying poetry, I would select no because I don't generally read poetry. But then recently it occured to me that I love lyrics, and what are lyrics if not poetry set to music? I mean there are some songs out there that even without the music the words are a masterpiece all their own. 
So anyway, the thought occured that maybe I do like poetry, and by the same token maybe you already know ISFP poets, we've just been looking at them the wrong way.
Just something I've been mulling over."
1518,isfp,"It would be very difficult for me to tell.  
Also interesting would just be, e.g. poets that would appeal especially to ISFPs. I don't know, but I'd guess it would be more about the lush mouth-feel and easily-conjurable imagery, than (for example) metaphysical poetry."
1519,isfp,"Yeah, some possible ISFP musicians with interesting lyrics are Justin Vernon (Bon Iver), FKA Twigs, and Tom Waits (although I haven't listened to him that much, I like ""The Piano has been Drinking""). Do you know of any others?
A pattern I notice in these musicians' lyrics is strong Se-based imagery, backed up by Ni free association that hints at a hazy underlying meaning. There are also ISFP musicians with lyrics that are more straight to the point, simple and effective, like Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs."
1520,isfp,"Well, I don't know the types of a lot of the musicians I listen to, but IDR Labs says Bob Dylan is an ISFP and I would definitely look into his stuff if you haven't. Off the top of my head, I'd check out his song Masters of War. The lyrics are pretty powerful. Also Maynard (Tool/A Perfect Circle) is ISFP, so I'd say check out APC's Sleeping Beauty. "
1521,isfp,"Saw your sub and wanted to breath some life into it, anyways I'll start.
I'll keep it short and simple.
My type: ENTJ
Favorite type: INTP, I don't know where to start, from my experience with the few that I know, they tend to keep to themselves but if you let someone with this type actually open up to you and connect, they can be some of the most hilarious or interesting type people to have a one on one conversation with at 2 am, like they will think up the craziest things, and I'll think up how to actually make those things happen. Plus they are walking libraries, my cousin is one and his favorite hobby is legit learning things, whatever it may be, but when it comes to social interactions they can be so awkward in the cutest ways, anyways I think they can hold some of the most interesting conversations, just wish they would put more into action.
Least favorite type: ISTJ, never really knew any on a personal level, I think I just naturally don't get along with them, but I've worked with a few and it just annoys me how by the books they can be, like if there's a way to do something better, if I put it into action and actually yield more efficient/better results, they will still completely be against it. Honestly I like most people and can't really think of much negative things to say, what I do like about them however, is how serious they can commit to their work or passions, even if we don't see eye to eye I can totally respect that.
Also I did not keep this short and simple, oops. Also I want to connect with isfps better, feel free to tell me about yourselves and what you like about entjs :D
P.S. Let's make this sub great."
1522,isfp,"Aw, I don't feel like anyone should dislike another person because of their type, but I guess when it comes to ease of making friends/building a relationship I've noticed a few trends.
My type: ISFP
Easiest type to make friends with: xNTx. You all are very intellectual, fascinating to talk to, and the way you blend a visionary outlook and logical thinking is pretty incredible (and different than me, which is why I gravitate towards you all). My roommate in college this year is an ENTJ, and I'm always in awe at how naturally he takes on roles of leadership and can answer random questions and organize his environment well. He's very into stress reduction, so our apartment is decked out with essential oils, a salt lamp, etc. I guess it must be the whole opposites attract thing (although I have found myself in awe of other ISFP's with different artistic talents than mine, like Britney Spears with her dancing back in the day). The seriousness with which y'all take life is pretty adorable as well (in the BEST way!)
Hardest type to make friends with: ESTP, ESFJ, xSTJ. I don't have much of a problem with xNFx (albeit the cultish, SJW vibe I get from xNFJs and xNFPs I know at school that makes prolonged friendship strained and difficult). In my experience, ESTPs tend to stick around for literally a second as your friend, and then move on to the next interesting stimulus at their convenience. Se is wonderful and powerful, but I couldn't imagine living life with that little of an ability to ""stick"" around. ESFJs, hilarious and magnetic as they are, just don't come across to me as genuine people most of the time, and I always feel lowkey judged and/or tested talking to the ones I know. Sometimes it seems like anytime I talk to one, they speak as if they're addressing a whole crowd of people even if it's just me. And then xSTJ, I think it's just a matter of them holding on SO tightly to tradition that there's literally nothing I can debate them about. They also kind of tend to obsess over one topic (leadership, politics) and talk about it NONSTOP, which you can only pretend to be interested in for so long...
But anyways! That was surprisingly fun, thank you for that idea :)"
1523,isfp,"I admire ExxJs in general. I like how they are life teachers, and I can always learn something from all of them. But I don't hate a particular type. If I had to choose it would be unhealthy IxFPs (yes I include my type). I also don't like how the INFJ sub turned like... but I know one IRL that's a sweetie."
1524,isfp,I admire INTP and INTJ (burned by a manipulative person once - ex) for their smarts and INFJ (present gf) for their compassion. Less admiration towards ISTJ because of their above all and judgemental attitude. Though they have proved to be great friends in need.
1525,isfp,"My type: isfp
Types i feel most comfortable around:
Isfp, isfj, infp, infj,enfp, esfp istp
I guess mostly introverted feelers. Introverted because i just feel more comfortable with their vibes and feeling because i tend to feel intimidated by more thinking dominated types. I like chiller folks. 
Types i admire but never get along with: entj, entp, intp, estj, enfj intj
I pretty much suck at befriending extroverts. I cant keep up with all the talking and the hanging out they need. These folks always seem less chill and i like being around calm quiet people like me. Im also intimidated by their smarts and always astounded at how intensely they believe in their own opinions. Like, i dont assign very much value to my own opinions im always assuming im probably wrong about things. Idk even if i disagree with things they say i wouldnt be able to discuss stuff with them because their inner voices are just stronger. 
An exception to the intj thing is my boyfriend who is very compassionate and tender hearted and emotional for an intj. Still quite an intj though. We get along but others ive met have been too abrasive for me."
1526,isfp,"my type: ISFP 
i make good close acquaintances with ESFPs but whenever we start getting any close we tend to rub each other the wrong way at some point.
i Hate that whenever they get angry at you they try to burn down the entire bridge and other vindictive activities. 
I love being friends with INFPs because we always tend to understand each other well because we share the F function and the P function really well.
xNTX- are a really nice experience to be listen to and sometimes even be friends. 
INTJs- make good ranters  and are chill people who don't usually put up other with peoples crap which is admirable. 
ENTJs- are a very arrogant ,stubborn bunch but they also tend to be charismatic and efficient. though i also make good friends with them they can be real assholes especially when they get angry.
ENTP-  are very fun people to be  around but i don't like it when they get angry because throw every vulnerable thing they know about you and turn it into words. but i actually really like being around them because they are very kind and fun people to be around. 
I think i would get along with other ISFPs but i would not want it because it would feel be like being around myself."
1527,isfp,"I love your answers, thanks for taking the time. I've also noticed ISFPs and I gravitate towards each other despite being complete opposites. I'm surprised you like NTs though, a lot of people can find us off putting, especially ENTJs with how intense we can get."
1528,isfp,"I am an ISFP and my flatmate (2 years) is ISTJ. We connect a lot when we go for trekking/ hiking but other than that, all the 2 am talks are like me telling him about all my personal feelings and he being analysing/criticizing on them. These are very off-putting. Other than being a little judgemental he is of a very nice personality, highly motivated and ready to go over and above for helping any friend."
1529,isfp,"Could you emphasize on this more? Maybe something bad happened between you and an ENFP, but from what I seen, they are some of the most awesome people. I love how bubbly and happy they can be, even if it comes off as fake, the fact it can cheer many people up is awesome in my opinion."
1530,isfp,"SHIT this is so accurate and just gave me some insights into my relationships with people.
I should work on those... I think I can control the attention seeking to an extent but I don't know about self-centred. Someone should give me some advice. "
1531,isfp,"Haha what a cute response :-)
I think my favorites at the moment are ENFJ and ESFJ. I really admire ESFJ because they are so confident and they have skills I'd like (super outgoing and personable, let things roll of their backs). I like ENFJ because they are supportive and find me funny :) "
1532,isfp,"I always end up in this maze
everything's faster than me
today a dog shitted under my foot. 
‚Äã
I miss you as much as going to sleep
without worrying about tomorrow
I want to hold your hand.
‚Äã
You came back crying
something stuck its fingers in your neck
something hit me in the eye.
‚Äã
I did not think I couldn't swim here
Why do you allow me to become honey?
Why did I allow you to do it?
‚Äã
We always end up in this maze
but you still love me
I kissed you again."
1533,isfp,"I've written a poem like this before, not this format, but the general concept I think. From what I remember, I had a very specific idea while writing it but it was written in such a confusing type of grammer that only I could possibly know it's original meaning, and to anyone else it would seem random with a general theme maybe, and hopefully they could get their own meaning out of it.  "
1534,isfp,"I've taken many test to find myself here...
I've always felt alone, but throughout grade school I was apart of every group besides the cringey ones. Mostly because I was too self aware to know what I wanted to look like to everyone else.
(6'5 wide shoulder 200lbs decent face)
I spent my whole life putting up a front I was Unhurtable. I was on ,  football team,  the rugby team, band. (Secretly in a computer science club) I had so many... acquaintances.
Nobody to me was my friend the way I wanted them to be. I never went to parties and never bothered to invite anyone over.
Ive started noticing my jaw gets tight whenever I was feeling exposed (which is everywhere outside my 15x15 room). I never have had a girlfriend, I cant even imagine sharing my secrets (my secrets being I hate being social and just want to be by myself or my closely trusted.)
If I'm not alone I'm not relaxed, the constant feeling of being punched in the face everytime I drift into a exhausted sleep.
To this day I've had my small routine to not want to kill myself. Somedays my imagination of my moms face if I was to kill myself is what helped my remain here. I'm angry that I cant even leave peacefully without thinking of the family I would hurt. I care so much for those that have shown care for me but I am too stubborn to show them how I feel and what I want. 
Recently I've questioned my religious beliefs. I asked God to talk to me to show me something that I'm not wasting my words that he is there.
I've cared to much to regret nothing, that I havent lived.
I tell myself that we view others on there action and that we view ourselves on our intent, but all I see is my inner demons.
If God wont answer me and I'm to afraid of regret to ask my Mom the one person I've ever confided in my inner thoughts what do I do.
I'm posting this now before i edit so I wont delete it and be upset with myself.
How are am I suppose to live so alone.
How can I try to help others when I can't even help myself.
How can I view myself in a non self loathing way when I know I got my self in this mess along the way somehow.
Even if nobody reads this or comments on this at least I've tried to change my veiw."
1535,isfp,"Hey, sounds like you're going through a lot right now. I've been in some dark places in my past, and I understand some of these feelings you're describing.
Here is some truth: it is okay to ask for help and to feel confused. It's okay to change and it's okay to feel anxious in front of others. You can learn to own that part of yourself.
I would recommend therapy. Every time I've been to a mental health professional I've done much better with figuring myself out. The right one can really appeal to the down to earth ISFP nature and your sessions can be super productive.
Internet strangers can only know and answer so much. Professional counselors are really good at it!
Good luck, and take care of yourself! We love ya."
1536,isfp,"I was somewhat like this where I was so alone and didn't see anybody close to me as a real friend. I wasn't suicidal, and I didn't considered myself depressed since I saw myself as fairly well off with little to complain about considering there were people who felt worse than me, so I didn't complain. I was just so alone..  I never actually fixed my situation myself, everything just sort of happened.
I imagine our prayers were similar since our situation is so similar, but seemingly out of nowhere I got together with basically my perfect match, and got into the school I wanted, and both of these had such a little chance of happening that it was personal proof of God for me. And then everything just fell into place for me, I know who I am and I know where I'm going. It's incredible.
But the point isn't that god is the answer and prayer is going to bring you happiness, or a good school will fix your problems. I'm trying to say at some point probably sooner than your think you're going to find someone, be it friend or lover, and you won't feel alone anymore, and everything is just going to click and you'll know where you're going 
Hopefully I wrote that good enough to understand, now I'm going to write my ps before I decide I don't want to comment this
Ps if you are ever really alone and just need a chat, I'm sure any of us are up for it. also don't be hard on yourself, it may seem like you could have gotten out of this situation at any time, but it's just.. difficult."
1537,isfp,"lucky you that you get along with your mother.
‚Äã
I've written a post that you may find interesting. It's called ""why to live"". We can talk when you want. a thing I'd like to say is that if you're locked in your room, then how do you expect to have a girlfriend? find the activities you like the most, and there will be people, girls too.
‚Äã
https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/ajvfcw/why_to_live/"
1538,isfp,"Thanks, I've been debating to go to a therapists. Every month something piles onto the problems I cant teach myself how to fix, I thought after I graduated highschool all the fakeness of my life wouldn't matter but when all that fell away I'm left with nothing except a job and a 15x15 room I return to and sit until I decide to go to sleep. Thanks for your input il definently got to a therapist now."
1539,isfp,"I read you thread. Il put them all to use. One thing is I dont lock myself in my room I still have a job, 80 hours a week I'm plumbing. I travel all over the state and visit different locations I get out but dont talk to people.
The thought of wanting to talk to people means nothing to me, the only people I want to talk to are people I trust, recently I've been talking to new people now and then but I have no connect with them and it just end there.
I dont know how I would meet new people in activities. How do I join an activity. My friends dont do anything except play video games and when I go out I'm constantly wanting to go back home and be able to relax without have the muscle clenching social paranoia I hate.
Also if I could ask some advice I dont know if I actually want a girlfriend, I think I might just be trying to show my parents there is hope for the family Gene's. What I'm asking is how do I find out what I actually want in this scenario."
1540,isfp,"start thinking about what do you like. this year I started new classes of language. there are different people in different places.
also, it's ok that you don't like the majority of the persons in a groups, I think. I didn't like the majority of the people in my classrooms because they are very superficial and ungrateful. but there is always someone."
1541,isfp,"I've just recently started college. Thinking about working hands-on with computer parts and computer systems was my main motivation to get an education, so I chose CE as my major. However, I question myself whether or not I'll still be motivated when the road gets tough.
I'm curious to know if there are any other ISFPs in here that went into an engineering career and enjoyed it or had to give up on it. Also what branch/field interested you most?(mostly interested in CE fields because there are so many paths to choose from). Where are you now? Are you enjoying your career?
Also, do you guys like mathematics? I've really enjoyed math as far as calculus goes so far."
1542,isfp,"When I started college I was in mechanical engineering. I thought it sounded cool but hadn't really thought about it or what I wanted much at all. I ended up joining the college FSAE combustion racing team and getting really involved with that to the exclusion of all else. I loved the hands on work and actually building stuff and being on a team with people who actually seemed to like me (as opposed to my abusive family). But the farther I got into engineering classes and requirements the less I liked it. I hated calculus 1 and had to drop it because I wasn't doing well in it and had become suicidal for the first time. Then I stayed on the team but changed from Engineering to undecided for a while. I worked with career counseling and my therapist and she suggested I look into Public Health. I plays better to my strengths and is something I care about and is still problem solving which I like. I changed my major to public health and am still working on my degree. I sometimes wish I could have done engineering but I had to choose my health or I could have died. I do seem to enjoy my public health classes and am still figuring out exactly what I want to do with my degree as a career but that doesn't mean engineering won't work for you. I'm sorry if my post is depressing, I have had a bad past and childhood and relationship with my family and have depression ADHD and anxiety possibly tied to the emotional neglect and abuse but I'm working on recovering from that too. It makes my situation in college pretty different and challenging so maybe in a different life I could have done engineering but I have to try to do what works for me now"
1543,isfp,"ISFP here.
Computer Information Systems is one of my majors, but I wouldn't say I have a ""career"" yet.
On the mathematics side, I've always done well in math and it comes very naturally to me. I like how it's logic-based. I got through Calc 3 and Differential Equations in high school and part of me always wishes I'd gone into Physics."
1544,isfp,"No worries, thank you for the response! I'm glad you're doing alright, keep on fighting :) Life is full of opportunities and the past is the past.
Did you ever feel like math was somewhat of a breeze before calculus I, or did you just dislike math in general? I'm hoping my enjoyment in math translates to the more advanced courses like linear algebra and differential equations. I should be open to change, but I have no clue what else I'd enjoy doing haha"
1545,isfp,"In highschool? Nice, you're either gifted or really studious for an ISFP. It's never too late to go back to college, especially for something you'd enjoy a lot more in the long run and even have more success. Having that CIS major would still help you out in almost every other kind of career."
1546,isfp,"Also an ISFP looking to go into CIS, but I wasn't the best student in my last two years of high school (dropped out of honors/AP, didn't take math after algebra 2, stopped doing homework and barely passed a lot of my classes). I'm starting over this semester at community college and hoping I can turn it around for myself. Best of luck to you STEM-SFPs!"
1547,isfp,"Good luck!!! You're gonna do great mate <3
Productivity tip: make sure your study / work space is pretty. Get some desk toys to fiddle with when you gotta touch something, and use your Se to make an aesthetically pleasing desk."
1548,isfp,"Typically quite poorly. ISFPs have a strong inward desire to express themselves and to treat others in a way they would prefer to be treated. In such a situation we would become irritated and would not necessarily try to hide that fact. Individual outlook and specific circumstances do play a factor however. For instance, I have been micromanaged at work before (by different people) and have reacted both negatively and positively to it. The key difference for me being where the manager managed from. One would be around you all the time, the other would lay out specific criteria and hold you up to it later. The former situation was irritating because I was being shut down constantly, the latter was difficult as well but I used it to motivate me and excel in performance. When I am in the presence of the domineering person I am more affected by their lack of care because Se provides the external information to fuel sensitive Fi feeling tones. ISFPs can be quite resistant to intolerance when they are made to suffer away from it and not in front of it."
1549,isfp,"it depends how they're doing it I guess. last time someone told me what to do while I was driving I told them to fuck off. that's not very helpful though, sorry:P
sometimes I just ignore it if I can, or tell someone else about it I guess. I remember it happened a bit at my last job and a coworker noticed and told the other one off, personally I didn't really mind but if it got bad enough I would've told our manager or boss"
1550,isfp,"There‚Äôs lots of good advice already so Ato put it simply, avoid lashing out and treat them how you would like to be if you were in their position. Try to put yourself in their shoes and figure out why they behave the way they do. Maybe they feel they aren‚Äôt doing a good job as a supervisor and so they are being overbearing to try and compensate for their own anxieties. If that‚Äôs the case give them some compliments about the good things they do etc. Basically treat them well and they should start to trust you a bit more."
1551,isfp,"Ya know, I‚Äôve always thought I was an INFP. But I gave this exact response to someone when they asked the same question. I also don‚Äôt relate to a lot of the INFP sub, and I can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs its because some of them aren‚Äôt actual infp‚Äôs or if it‚Äôs me or what, but that sub seems so over invested in crap I don‚Äôt think anyone is truly invested in atm. 
But either way, I totally relate your response."
1552,isfp,How do you deal with such a person? She is one of my superiors as well and I don't want to constantly feel irritated toward her because I don't want those negative emotions constantly. Do you have any ideas?
1553,isfp,"With patience and decency, basically with what you feel like you are not getting from her. My best advice would be to give her the respect that her position deserves, not necessarily what she deserves. Somewhere deep down that should resonate with her, it won't be overnight though and it won't be easy. Most people in the work force take their jobs and the people they work with for granted, by deciding to be excellent in all that you do towards her you are showing her that you can be trusted and respected and that is your input is important. It also shows her that you care, many times these negative ways of living life towards others originates from being unloved and uncared for. For example lets say her name is Sarah, Sarah might say ,""Jim and Katie (examples of coworkers) don't ever do their job, they back-talk me, they have bad attitudes, etc. But not Sahil, Sahil cares about the work she/he does and she/he makes my life a lot easier because I don't have to worry about Sahil."" This will normally happen, and it happened for me! Whether they want to or not, they will be forced to recognize that you do your job, even if they don't want to admit it. Some die-hards may not, but they are the exception, not the rule.  In many cases the unloved and uncared for simply become the unloving and uncaring and the process comes full circle. Be a cycle breaker! : )  If something inappropriate or unlawful is going on at your workplace that is an entirely different matter because then it needs to be addressed to keep you and others safe. Otherwise, being the best worker and person you can be and showing her kindness she doesn't deserve is the best way to reach her. If it is hard to find ways to do this or if she is just literally unreachable try to maintain a healthy distance while still doing your job. It will take time though. Does this help?"
1554,isfp,"Im glad! Sorry if my replies were a tad long. I hope it goes well for you. I know many ISFPs like myself struggle with being sensitive, and I know that we can't really get away from that part of ourselves. We can have an impact on the source of the pain and our response to it though, and I guess that's what I was trying to get at, sorry if I rambled. If you need more advice later on, I'd be happy to respond to that post too. I hope it goes well üôÇ"
1555,isfp,"Hello, guys. I need your help.
When I take the test from 16personalities, it shows I am a ISFP. But when I take the Personality Hacker's test, it show INTJ. 
I have seen they are similar in some perspectives, but what truly differ them in your opinion?"
1556,isfp,"Honestly only thing I can think of is the basics : how do you handle confrontation? I am a isfp & I hate confrontation, arguing, fighting & sometimes debating . I also never leave my opinion under comments if I think it‚Äôs gonna start an argument or offend someone. Yes!, I‚Äôm lil bitch lol I procrastinate a lot and I‚Äôm super sensitive, quiet & friendly & I love aesthetics üòä . Intjs are nothing like isfp‚Äôs ü§® who told you that lie lol. They‚Äôre nothing alike "
1557,isfp,"I had the same problem. Sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to tell what order your functions are in especially if you are in an unhealthy place mentally. See how you react to things and research how the two types react as well. Also observe which you relate to more when you are happy. For example, do you FEEL the best living and experiencing the present moment or do you PREFER  to think about the future and progress. It‚Äôs best to observe what you feel your best doing rather than what you habitually do because these two types can look like each other when they are unhealthy. Sometimes an ISFP seems like an INTJ if they get in the routine of obsessing with their progress and whatnot. Their unhealthy habits are not how they actually are when they are doing great. Or you could just completely not be either type. At least this is what I experienced. Hopefully my crappy advice helped in some way. üëçüèº"
1558,isfp,"Look into cognitive functions. INTJ is Ni dominant while ISFP is Fi dominant. Once you figure out your dominant function it should be easy to tell (google for introverted intuition and introverted feeling mbti). 
You can also try carefully reading through these socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.   
ISFP by Gulenko | ISFP by Stratiyevskaya | ISFP subtypes 
INTJ by Gulenko | INTJ by Stratiyevskaya | INTJ subtypes "
1559,isfp,"Would have to agree here. I got ENFP in 16 Personalities and an ENTP in Personality Hacker. And I‚Äôm most definitely 100% an ENFP.  
OP I would likely trust 16 Personalities more, but check out the conflictive functions! "
1560,isfp,"INTJ and ISFP have the exact same cognitive functions, just in a different order. INTJ = Ni, Te, Fi, Se; ISFP = Fi, Se, Ni, Te. ISFP also tends to be fairly intuitive, it wouldn't be hard to assume you're an intuitive type, or a Ni-dom. OP, try looking into the cognitive functions and focus on your thought process. Do you follow more of a Ni+Te process, or a Fi+Se process? Look upnyhe website mbtifiction.com, the dude that writes a lot of the content is an INTJ and has several posts about this, about ISFPs, and typing in general. Best of luck! "
1561,isfp,"Ive been an INTP for quite a while now.. i remember taking the test like two years ago and getting INTP, ive took it a few dats ago and bam INTP again, then i read a thread about soneone advertizing their site that had the test too but with only 32 questions instead of 60 like the one from 16personalities, i took it and now im an ISFP :/, 
Heres the site if you want to check it out..
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test"
1562,isfp,I took this quiz you linked us to. It got me spot on. Like the percentages are almost exactly the same as the 16 personalities. But thats just me. That doesn't mean you are wrong or not mistyped as one of us. Probably just a form of testing that isn't good for your type! try taking it like 3 times at different times of day or something and see if you get used to it. 
1563,isfp,"Hi! My bff/roommate and I make a podcast where we use Myers Briggs to talk about self-discovery, humor, pop culture and more. I love sharing the episodes with Reddit because great conversations often come out of it.

I loved the questions Meredith came up with, do you plan them beforehand or go with the flow?"
1565,isfp,"I suspect he is an ISFP, and he refuses to take the quiz, so i typed him based on readings and functions (FiSeNiTe) The problem is that I am not seeing his Fi very much. I am wondering if you could donate some aid to finding him out. some traits are
Comes up with excuses to not go out to play a game with me
prefers video games to any other option (and is very good at it).
gets migraines A LOT (don't think this will help)
attacks you when you poke him too much.
gets angry when you don't believe him when he is lying.
hope you can find it out! thanks in advance!"
1566,isfp,"He denies the lying thing, and I confronted him about it one time, and he denied it, getting angry at the same time because he was lying. I just wonder IF it's a tick he has grown with because of his family life, or not getting enough practice or something like that. i just added it because if it was i similarity that i didn't want to leave out."
1567,isfp,"Is he easy for you to notice when he's lying? If you're questioning between ISFP and ISTP, there's a lot of differences in their internal thinking. When ISTPs lie, it tends to be because speaking the truth would be harsh for the people around them. In my experience, ISTPs aren't interested in lying, like it's a hassle. This may be true for ISFPs too, but I find that ISFPs would more likely lie for personal reasons, like defending something that is personal to them."

1569,isfp,"I‚Äôm extremely quiet around people I‚Äôm not close with and or people I would rather not be surrounded. Why? Idk I‚Äôve always been a shy/reserved type of person. If a isfp is really talkative around a person, it usually means they really like them"
1570,isfp,"I'm quiet around people I don't trust. I don't expect my feelings will be respected, so I won't share them. Around friends I'm pretty loud though.
I'm not a fan of sarcastic humour because it often strikes me as mean-spirited. Realistically it probably isn't, a lot of the time. It's just whenever I get the urge to make a sarcastic comment, it's always at someone else's expense. So that's probably coloured my perception of sarcasm in general."
1571,isfp,"Yes, also I‚Äôm sometimes sarcastic but I‚Äôm trying to stop being sarcastic at all because I think it‚Äôs mean. I don‚Äôt talk a lot unless I know and trust you and think I have something worth adding to the conversation. I don‚Äôt like speaking just for the sake of speaking and try to think carefully before engaging. I also fear getting hurt and speaking is an opportunity for that to happen so I‚Äôm quite reserved unless I trust that person. "
1572,isfp,"Hey same! I'm an ISTP so I naturally used to be quiet, but the last year I have been really out going and loud. I realize now that it was mostly due to some underlying social anxiety. I'm working on listening more and talking less."
1573,isfp,"I'm also extremely skeptical on thinking you can understand people by how they get answers in this test though as it really just plops people into general things. 
Booze makes me loud as fuck though. "
1574,isfp,"When boarding a plane I had the boarding pass printed on a standard piece of typing paper.  The gate attendant asked everyone to fold their boarding pass in half to save time.   
I folded mine vertically instead of horizontally.   Got sent to the end of the line."
1575,isfp,"Upfront I just want to say that I know ISFPs aren't artists in the strictest sense, but more like creative types in whatever way that manifests.
This is a serious issue for me. Ever since before grade school I enjoyed and was gifted at art. I kept it up though high school, as an elective, but was always very shy about it. Even if I won awards, I was still super shy and worried about what others thought about it and could always see my flaws in my works right away. And even if I did truly think it was the best thing ever, I couldn't handle people looking at it because it was an extension of me, so by them judging it, they are judging me. Even if they are just looking it at, they are looking deep within me. But I enjoyed art so I kept doing it... until university, then I stopped (I was accepted to go to school for digital graphics/design, but bailed on that, to chose engineering at a different school instead and well.. changed majors twice since that, got an MA in a different field and now work in a different field than any of it, and well, still don't know what to do... but I digress).
Well, now, as an adult, I stopped doing art for the most part. I get the opportunity a fair amount in my life, but I just can't handle the responsibility or possible criticism that I might accrue if I show others what I can do. No one in my life now even knows of my past as being artsy. But I do. And I know it's been a decade since I've done anything consistent, so the art I produce now, in my eyes, is of course not good and embarrassing and totally going to be criticized (so I think...). 
Anyways, the thing is, whenever I'm given an opportunity to engage in art I either: 
a. do it and then erase it or pretend I didn't do it (by throwing it away or hiding it). 
b. outright refuse to be involved since I think option a. will happen again. 
c. I say I'll do it, but then bail at the last minute --- this one has caused me to lose integrity and potential friends and stuff, ugh:(
tl;dr: So ""Artists"", how do you manage to do creative things with all that criticism flying about?"
1576,isfp,"As a composer, I feel this very deeply. When I got to college I tried to give up because composing became a huge stressor for me. I began to fear everything you just said. But I'm making myself continue it anyway because I refuse to give into my anxiety and self criticism. 
So I relate. If you ever wanna PM me we can vent about this together if you want. I'm a pretty good listener and it's nice to know someone is in the same boat. :)"
1577,isfp,"I'm a perfectionist myself, and I've always been the type to never give myself enough credit for anything I do. One thing about me, though, is I never stopped consistently doing my art. Eventually criticisms turned into praises, and I learned how to believe in myself. It's ok to be self-critical, but if you have a talent for something, you should let yourself enjoy a pat on the back once in a while. Also, screw the haters - do you."
1578,isfp,"I'm not sure if I'd be able to manage my creativity if I wasn't so self critical - it's all about constructive criticism though. It's how level up my skills to the next level, always pushing to get better. If I wasn't critical of myself/my art I wouldn't be able to advance as quickly (or even at all). 
But, I get that it's easy to be critical non-constructively. You just have to tell that non-constructive (""I'm terrible,"" ""No one will like this"" etc) voice to shut the fuck up because it isn't helpful. Developing a ""fuck it"" attitude and letting some things just go has been helpful to my art and me as a person. "
1579,isfp,"You just dont show your art, personally i studied design but i realized that i wasn't doing art for myself, it's just design...
So i quit and now i do programming and play the guitar and to songs just for my own  =)"
1580,isfp,"I think it's so important to be okay with being average. There's a line between being okay with being less than extraordinary and being apathetic. I feel like we're afraid that if we're not criticizing ourselves we won't make something great. Accepting being average means you can objectively go about improving. Instead of thinking ""this painting is absolute crap"", it can become ""it could use more red over here and shading over there"". My explanation of what's called self-compassion can't do it justice, so I'm linking a video that showed me that we can be okay and still strive to be better."
1581,isfp,"Slim or straight slim jeans or chinos. Usually v-neck shirts, sometimes flannels or other button-downs. Sometimes I'll layer shirts. A denim jacket or a hoodie. Sneakers. Aviators when it's sunny. Sometimes a beanie when I don't wanna fix my hair.
I usually go with a sort of messy look."
1582,isfp,"Fellow isfp since as long as I can remember.. new to this sub‚Ä¶hey, everyone :) As a guy I dress and pick the right colour according to the weather, season, and amount of light out each day. Always slim, dark jeans and boots. I‚Äôll layer different patterned shirts, pick a colourful scarf and wear a suit jacket over it all‚Ä¶weather permitting. "
1583,isfp,"Lots of long, dark-colored tops, not too picky about bottoms. I found out this summer that sometimes it's just too damn hot for skinny jeans.
Nothing too flashy or bright. Very neutral. Tasteful, classic, classy. I've developed a fondness for saying that my wardrobe is probably the most conservative thing about me."
1584,isfp,"I try for simple and timeless. I don't like buying ""trendy"" clothes. I prefer to have something that will go with many items I have in my closet but also won't be outdated when the next season rolls around. I usually go for fairly neutral colours, black, grey, navy, army green, pale pink, white. 
However when I'm just at home and casual I'm content with jeans/leggings, t-shirt, hoodie and vans. "
1585,isfp,"Usually black as the main color (I pretty much always wear skirts and they're all solid black). I mostly wear grays and whites to compliment that, but I have a few dark purples and blues that I like to wear as well. For patterns, I have some skull patterned stuff and flashy red and black stripes that I usually only wear if I'm going out or too lazy to wash my clothes, haha."
1586,isfp,"So throughout my life, I've loved to try new experiences, I've loved to build things with my hands, I've loved to create physical sculptures, to see the fruits of my labors. In high school, I got into game development, thinking that it would be a good intersection of an artistic and lucrative profession.
Through the end of high school and all through college, I had this dream of being an indie game developer, thinking I'd one day be able to make a game that was lucrative enough to dig me out of this hole that I felt I was living in. I think it was this dream of not having to work the corporate 9-5 that kept me going. So somehow, I actually find an opportunity to pull this off, to get some funding and start a company. However, now that things have calmed down, I've never felt more unfulfilled in my life. 
All I've ever wanted ever, since I was just a kid, was a girlfriend, and yet, I've never been able to get one. For some reason, I felt that having money would be enough, but as I have finally gained financial independence, I can see (and to many this is obvious), that this is such a small part of the equation.
I think part of the reason I can't find someone is that I act really desperate, because the truth is I am. Programming feels like rock compared to the clouds and water and fire of love. I'd don't love programming, I don't love myself so I'm desperate to find emotional fulfillment somewhere else.
It seems to me that finding a job that hits close to the feeling of love is the only way I could make a relationship work. The only problem is, I have extremely limited skill in the artistic/athletic pursuits that seem to sufficiently entertain other ISFPs. I feel pretty stuck. My parents are extremely narcissistic and authoritarian so there's no way I'm going back home... 
Any suggestions? I really appreciate any thoughts.
TLDR: Spent my high school and college years trying to force myself into a square hole for the sake of money. Forever relationship-less and unhappy, un-purposeful, I don't know the way out."
1587,isfp,"Getting over that for ISFP can be hard, I worked on myself for quite some time, just by getting into a lot of small social engagements to practice and develop communication. Just start by exploring and meeting people without any expectation of what it is to be. For example I work in a call center making minimal $, but I‚Äôve learned a lot about what people are like, and for a big part of it, people are really similar. 
I think the biggest thing is just trying to understand what people are. Explore, notice patterns, you‚Äôll start to see lots of similarities between people and you can start to feel solid about your communication skills. 
Also observe that a lot of people are actually quite decent, I‚Äôve had a lot of angry callers turn really friendly just by understanding their situation.  I mean, they were at the point of getting lawyers involved and literally yelling at the top of their lungs. Just so you know, I have a very low energy personality and don‚Äôt do very well in public speaking, but you‚Äôd be surprised how people change when you just work to understand them. You can figure it out, you can get there, just don‚Äôt try to be a personality, use yours and learn what people are like. That‚Äôs my experience from the last 10 years of traveling, teaching, and meeting people from many different backgrounds. People are really quite similar. Cheers!"
1588,isfp,"I do enterprise programming for a living and I love it. Do not underestimate financial freedom.
Have you tried tinder? After paying for professional pictures and taking advice form fiends I've had some luck there in rising my self-confidence."
1589,isfp,"hey man. just dont give up. Love is not forced. I cant help but tell you to try find God and live to love him but some how I dont think that is something you are open to. Spiritual wellness is an actual thing and I never want to force someone into religion, because that does not help them. Im also not saying become religious, Im talking about a relationship with God. Also try find a hobby that is different to your work, maybe more physical since you are a developer. Ill use something I did: I was feeling down and lonely after moving into a new place, I needed a table so instead of buying one, I made one. I love the look of wood so I went and got tools, asked advice and now ill keep this table till I die or it burns down or something. 
On relationships: Oh boy. I know its not fun. some cliche but dont try and force it. this is where a hobby could be helpful. you can start something that has group classes etc. I know groups suck but with time that becomes easier. Love is not a job, it has to form naturally.
Best of luck to you in this new part of your journey. Hope I could have helped in some way. Even if it is just to open your mind to something else."
1590,isfp,"Honestly, I know where you are coming from. I was in a very similar situation. I wanted to do graphic design but my strict mother wouldn‚Äôt let me. I was stuck studying something I didn‚Äôt really like. I worked really hard to keep my scholarship but everything felt so meaningless. I hated myself too. So I got into a relationship because the guy seemed nice. I wanted to feel good about myself. But you know what? Relationships take a lot of work. You have to be healthy yourself to have a healthy relationship or you and your partner will be miserable anyway. I‚Äôm doing much better now that I actually pursued something I like. I think you are right in figuring out that your career is the main thing to deal with right now. Because we depend mostly on Fi, and we have to feel like our work represents us somehow. Figure out your career first. It‚Äôs good you have financial independence. Remember you will still need it to figure out what to do with yourself and what you need to pursue. Don‚Äôt throw that financial stability away. Look at forums with people in industries you want to look into. Work on yourself first and the right person will come into your life."
1591,isfp,"I don't think changing careers is a good move for you. You are trying to fix one issue by creating another! Emotional fulfillment from a job is an ideal, it is a lot to ask for. You are so lucky to feel financially independent at your young age. Start thinking about the future (hard for us ISFPs I know) and what you want from it and start saving your money to make it happen. You could save enough to 'retire' early if you put your mind to it and don't succumb to lifestyle inflation. By retire this could mean travel non-stop, actually retire and pursue charitable/familial endeavours/ go back to school or work as something that is very poorly paid and that you LOVE! check out /r/financialindependence for ideas. 
You do not get fulfillment solely from relationships, if you were to enter one now I guarantee you would become codependent on them for your happiness and this would either drive them away or bring you into a toxic and unhealthy relationship. Think about your role models and the people you know who holds values that you admire. What do they do to gain fulfilment and inner peace? You need to build a life that makes you happy on your own before you should think about bringing someone else into it because a partner should be a happy little add-on or extension to your already good life. 'Good' life could mean anything to anyone. It could mean the cat you adopted as a kitten, it could mean spending time with your family and parents as they age, it could mean weekend yoga classes that help your mental state and get you fit, it could mean power-lifting or crocheting. Try to connect with others and be kind to yourself and them. 
Lots of love. "
1592,isfp,"I don't think it's even an issue of self confidence. It more just like at this point, I've had so much heartbreak an unrequited love that it makes it difficult to get close to anyone for fear of the pain that would likely come of it... 
As far as Tinder... I haven't considered getting professional images. Most of what I do have is not good just because I've never been one to want pictures taken of me..."
1593,isfp,"Yah, you‚Äôve got to love yourself before loving others? I totally feel that. Think I‚Äôve been trying to do that for some time, I thought I had it, a great girl came along and I was forced to come to terms that I hadn‚Äôt. Just feel so behind at this point not even having had much physical intimacy or a relationship at my ripe age of 22. Seems like it will never happen sometimes‚Ä¶ but perhaps there is just more self work left to go than I originally thought‚Ä¶"
1594,isfp,"I appreciate your thoughts. I agree the relationship would be toxic and codependent, but that doesn't seem half bad right now. 
How do I get over the jealousy of all my friends and colleagues who were able to experience relationships throughout their childhoods? I can't help but feel shattering pain and jealousy when I hear about experiences others have had that I've wanted so bad, but have not been able to have myself."
1595,isfp,"Hi there-- I'm sorry I forgot to respond. 
I get that. In fact, I started my first relationship because I felt the same way. But I regretted it later because I didn't love him, you know? You want to share yourself with someone you truly love. I couldn't even kiss him. I don't think he truly loved me either.
There's always going to be more self work... but don't dwell on it because you're going to be depressed af, always thinking you aren't good enough. I think achieving financial stability is a good thing because then you have time to find yourself, not worrying about survival."
1596,isfp,"I see him sometimes but can never predict when, which is why it's so hard to just approach him and talk lol. I don't know if he's artistic but he's always reading a book. Maybe I should ask him about that. But was I thinking of saying ""hey, I like your bag"", and when he says ""thanks I like yours too"", I'll say ""thanks, I got it from the Illustrator convention at blah blah blah..."" and talk about myself."
1597,isfp,"I think you need to see a counsellor, friend. I understand the jealousy but you need to work through those feelings and I think the most effective way of doing that is to see a professional who can give you proactive advice and be a kind ear. I have seen counsellors multiple times, for ISFPs I think they can be invaluable. You need to learn more about yourself and why you are feeling this way, it isn't simply a lack of a relationship.  "
1598,isfp,"So if I've learned anything from trying to approach women in the past few weeks, it's that the hardest part is just the approach! Once you're actually talking its a lot easier (for me at least). So just try and forget everything and say hi! Good luck!"
1599,isfp,"Hello ISFPs, I come to you for some insight and advice (and a bit of a shoulder to cry on). My boyfriend of almost 3 years, ISFP, broke up with me very recently. For some context, I am an ENFJ (f). 
To cut a long story short, we have been in a long distance situation for most of our relationship. But we have had some pretty amazing adventures - collectively, we have crossed the Atlantic 8 times, we traveled all over the US east coast, etc. It hasn't always been easy, but I can confidently say that we truly love each other. Recently, he decided that the distance was too great for him, since it would be between 1-2 years before we could live in the same country again, and he was uncertain if he wanted to make the sacrifices needed to make that happen.
I think we are both having a hard time dealing with this. We are both very much still in love with each other, but his doubts and fears are too much for him to handle right now. He wants intimacy and someone there with him, physically. I can fully understand this, but it's still a slap to the face, given everything we've been through. The last we spoke, he said he isn't sure if he is making the right decision, but hopes that we (he) will be happier in the long run.
As a romantic, I'm having a hard time comprehending this. I understand it on an intellectual level, but cannot morally agree with it. I would never leave someone I was still deeply in love with, I would always fight tooth and bone for them. I swing between sadness, indifference (knowing that there is absolutely nothing I can do to change this situation/his mind), anger (for having it end in such a pathetic way given our history) and pity for him (for feeling not strong enough to deal with the distance).
Sorry for the wall of text, I was hoping to get some insight from other ISFPs, word of encouragement, whatever. Thanks for reading."
1600,isfp,"I think a big part of this is that ISFPs are pretty reliant on physical contact. In many ways we show our affections through our actions, so its difficult in long distance relationships because we can't do things for our SO. If we can't show affections through actions, we have to rely on words, which is not impossible, but is a bit more difficult, so it is frustrating. 
I know this doesn't help the situation much, but it might help explain some things. Maybe talk to him and see if these could be reasons of his decision and see if he can brainstorm with you to find a way around it."
1601,isfp,"Hello. Sorry about the break up, but I do understand his point of view. I am currently dating an ENFP, but that may change soon. As a senior in high school and her being a soon to be college freshman, the relationship will become long distance in about two months. She is going to school seven hours away. While not impossible, I am seriously considering breaking up because of this.
It's nothing personal, as I do love and care for her very much, it's just that love for me means a lot of physical contact or at least physical closeness. She is one of the kindest people I know, so it will be a terrible loss. Just know that it isn't personal and he probably still cares for you very much, but at least I feel sad if I haven't been physically close to my girlfriend for even a day."
1602,isfp,"ISFPs strive to have others' feelings constant with theirs. If he is genuinely a happy person he will make sure you are content. If you have developed a deep relationship - and I'm sure you have given you are ENFJ- he would never  forget you and will keep some sort contact. I'd say give him some space as SPs don't like to be nagged on or pushed to do something. All of luck. ISFPs are the best.
--I for myself have always wanted to meet a ENFJ lady to build a deep empathic honest relationship."
1603,isfp,"Indeed, this is the reasoning he gave me. He needs someone here and now, and our lives are ""too complicated"" with long distance. He'd rather be alone or with someone else, since having a long distance relationship is pretty much like not having a relationship at all, to him. It is extremely hurtful given the fact that we've been hacking at this for almost three years, and as I said in my original post, we have been through hell and high water together. I'm usually projecting myself into the future (such is being an NF), but with him I learned to be immersed in the present. This skill has now become a curse, because I never thought I'd see the day where I'd be so hung up on memories and the past.
I completely and totally understand him on an intellectual level. He is not being unreasonable or illogical, I just do not agree with it at all. Unfortunately he did not see a way around this, even though I was planning on visiting him in a few months' time for several weeks. I think he felt cornered into this decision, whereas I feel like he cornered himself into it. Such is differing viewpoints.
Thank you for being kind enough to respond, it means a lot to me."
1604,isfp,"Thank you for your insight... you are significantly younger than me but it's definitely interesting to hear your opinion :)
I always found that to be such a strange idea.... I am under the conviction that if you find someone that you love, it is truly a special thing. Finding something like that doesn't happen all the time, so you should savour and cherish it when it does come around. Some people are really not that lucky and never get to fall in love. This is why it is so painful... if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I cannot understand wanting to be alone over the alternative. 
Yes, I was told several times that ""it could have been anyone"" and he would have made this decision. Again, that just makes it hurtful. Am I really just anyone else? Your ENFP might be feeling the same way if you break up with her.... sorry, the NF is really fighting the SP vibes here. It's just difficult, is all. I will never fully understand. Thanks for the insights."
1605,isfp,"Thank you very much for taking the time to respond to my post, it means a lot to me. It's funny that you should mention that he wants me to be content, he called me earlier to ask if I was alright. I suppose the gesture in itself was sweet, but it was awkward and emotional since there is an elephant in the room the size of a broom closet. He tries so hard to justify everything to me, but there is absolutely left to be done except let time heal.
Thank you for your advice. I have not tried to make any contact with him since we broke up, all contact has come from his side. The finality of it all is taking a long time to digest. I thought SP types were supposed to be open-ended? I dunno. I'm still waiting for someone to shake me awake and tell me it was a nightmare, or fast forward like some movie montage 5 years down the road and have us meet again in some serendipitous way. 
ISFPs are great. I will miss mine. Thank you."
1606,isfp,"Thank you for your response. I think N types are a little more tolerant of long distance, maybe because aren't so driven by our senses, and the mental stimulation is more important. It's good that yours worked out.
I agree that all it takes is patience. He just didn't have it. I did what I could and told him everything possible to convince him. His only response was, ""I can't do this, I can't be in a relationship with someone who is never here. I'm better off being alone [or with someone else]."" I guess he didn't want to waste his youth on this. We haven't spoken since we broke up, and I think it would be inappropriate of me to intrude on his life. If there is ever going to be a chance of us working again in the future, I need to let him to go find his own happiness; while I find mine. 
Thank you. Everyone is made different, that's all."
1607,isfp,"I often feel like I'm too serious around other people. When I first meet people, I don't try to make them laugh, I try to get to know them and see if they're the type of person I want to invest my time in. If I decide I want to, I don't build the relationship on humor; that comes later for me. 
However, a lot of times when I watch other people form relationships, they make fast friends because they find something to laugh about quickly. 
I, like everyone else, love to laugh, but I suppose I see humor as something that doesn't come until later in the relationship when I'm comfortable. Also, I enjoy discussing ""serious"" topics more than I like joking around.
Is seriousness related to being an ISFP?"
1608,isfp,"I agree. I can't joke around with someone unless I know them really well otherwise I'll just worry if they're offended. 
I also tend to take jabs at people as humor and my friends are cool with it but a new friend probably wouldn't be."
1609,isfp,"I think about this sometimes too. I'm a funny guy, but making jokes takes mental energy that I don't always have. Sometimes I will take a leap of faith and be funny because I sense something good. Most of the time I'm too serious... especially if I don't feel totally accepted already."
1610,isfp,I think that's normal for ISFPs. I remember reading the MBTI description and it saying how ISFPs take life very seriously. I'm kind of the same way and I'm better at talking about serious stuff but I try to keep conversations light-hearted when meeting new people since most people are more comfortable with that.
1611,isfp,"yes! i'm just not funny in general i don't think. i feel the same way. when i first meet someone i like to see if we have common interests. but, for me, i'd invest my time in anyone who's tolerant of who i am. i engage in really deep subjects all the time... with close ppl, that is. not rlly outside of my family tbh. other ppl don't like that shi--"
1612,isfp,"Yep I've been told, and I have said, that I'm way too serious about most things. It makes me feel really boring when people don't know me well because many will kind of look past me on days when I don't have the mental energy to not be serious. It's my default. 
I also like being taken seriously and I want to establish that to new people because I'm so scared of being seen as weak. I had a problem with that as a kid. People, namely my family, implied that I was weak and naive and needed to be taken care of, which I didn't need to be. I just didn't do things the way they expected me to and they interpreted it as childish I guess. So I grew up being really self-conscious of looking like the typical ISFP (dreamy, offbeat, seemingly aloof) and developed my J. I believe this is what causes my current anxiety. But in any case, I want to be taken seriously so I don't have to feel that disapproval or being looked down upon because I have too ""free of a spirit."" 
It's partially that and partially not having the energy to make jokes yet/being afraid of offending them. I want to know the person first and know how to make them laugh."
1613,isfp,"Yes, deep conversations sustain us!
I often feel bad for not being more of a light hearted communicator, but when I think about it, I don't care for a lot of joking or sidetracking of the  conversation. I like things straightforward. 
And I'm not interested in constantly trying to be entertaining in a conversation. 
I knew that others had to feel the same, it's just seems so difficult to find people to have good discussions with. "
1614,isfp,"i couldn't agree more. i wish i could tunnel deeper into conversations, but at the same time i feel like they would just stare at me funny like i'm joking or get bored and change the subject. i just diverge from ppl my age i guess; they like to gossip.. and they're really blunt! i'm just too sensitive for that stuff so i just don't join in. "
1615,isfp,"I have a crush on an ISFP. Possibly ESFP. How do I make it work with her? She is pretty nice and always happy. She always has a smile on her face (not when she's serious though). She likes to see other people's reactions a lot. She's always willing to help and can't turn down a request from someone. She's quite irrational sometimes. 
Can you tell me a bit about what you hate about us Ti users and what you people like in a person? 
I don't know what else to ask. If you've got experience with an ISTP before, maybe share that. Thanks. 
EDIT: After thinking about it and with the help of a commenter, she's an ESFP."
1616,isfp,"She sounds like an ESFP, even in that brief description. My best friend is one and I would say she isn‚Äôt too discerning about Ti folks, or anything. As long as you can keep it light with her, she‚Äôll be down for an initial chat. Not to imply lack of substance, but generally a good initial approach is lightheartedness. 
You can also just have a frank conversation with her, regardless of what MBTI she is, about the way your brain works, so she can understand you better. "
1617,isfp,"I'm an f/ENTP who is currently pursuing an f/ISFP. She's pretty insecure about herself, and I am pretty confident about myself, how do I make her feel more comfortable with herself and reciprocate my feelings?"
1618,isfp,"Time. At least for me that‚Äôs how i met my ex at one point. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the same for everyone, but just casual everyday talk about personal stuff that‚Äôs not too personal? Like get to know them but make it subtle so they don‚Äôt realize they gave up that trust for you."
1619,isfp,"I mean you'll have to spend some time with her for this to work... but for me,  it meant so much for my husband (boyfriend at the time. lol)   to see all my ""flaws"" and the bad parts of myself that I normally hide or feel insecure about... for him to see those and still just love me all the more and kind of shrug like none of those things could ever be a deal breaker anyways.   He has always made me feel loved unconditionally. "
1620,isfp,"DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH HER
Be nice to her and earn her trust until she's comfortable with you and knows you care about and VALUE her feelings.  Then you can work on helping her fight her insecurities.  Essentially what I would recommend is to nurture her in such a way that she is free to express her feelings without judgement.  That is very empowering for the ISFP.  Help her find her place and her role within the world, and she will be content there.  "
1621,isfp,"I'm nice to literally everyone I know but this one person can annoy me a lot. I think they're an ENFJ and I always try to be nice to them however after a while the rage starts coming out. It's not because they're like being rude to me as well, it's cause I can feel like they're not acting like them true self. The other day I think I went overboard with the rudeness and we spoke about it over text. I tried explained to them saying why I act this way and after that we kind of resolved it but I still feel like I didn't make them 100% happy. What can I do to stop being rude? "
1622,isfp,"I also wanted to say, this doesn't happen often. It doesn't happen at all. Being rude doesn't define who I am but it's hard trying to keep everyone happy. This situation was my fault tho and I am not happy with myself about it and I don't want something like that to happen again. I tried giving constructive criticism but I don't think that worked out well also. "
1623,isfp,Tell them what you just wrote.  TBH your honesty and transparency is probably better than just being nice.  If somebody doesn't value that about you then it should tell you a lot about whether or not you want to continue putting any effort into them.  Good for you for admitting to yourself the truth about the situation though.
1624,isfp,"I basically live in a place where most people are just clones of each other. Talk the same, dress the same, look the same etc, I have this friend and basically I know theyre not really like everyone else however they still try to act like everyone else, just be yourself! Idk if i am making sense or not "
1625,isfp,"Here is my opinion, All humans have a dominate cognitive function, we value this function a lot and tend to project it onto the others and believe that they should value the same things we do. In the ISFP's case it's Introverted Feeling which some people refer to as authenticity, thus you tend to believe all people should behave authentically. If your friend is truly  an ENFJ that would mean he has dominate Fe, which is focuses on social harmony. Thus probably believes people should behave in a way that maintains the peace. You say he doesn't act like himself but who he is at his core is someone will value social affirmation, that is who he at his core, his authentic self. He is someone who will align himself with the values of other people there is no changing that. Understand that you and him are similar, you both give up individuality in different ways. All humans contain a cognitive function that keeps them from getting themselves exiled from tribe or human groups. If you think about it this would been very important in ancient cavemen times as getting exiled would have meant death.  I will explain how, you have Fi which means you have subjective inner values and emotions that are not affected by the emotions or values of others. So your individuality is Fi. However, where you are forced to harmonize is your inferior Te. This function makes you very concerned about your social status and the opinions of others. So much so that you will change your behavior to make sure people don't think negatively of you. This can also make you likely to fall victim to group think, in the sense if a lot of people think something to be true, then it must be true. Now if we analyze your friend he harmonizes via his Fe which means he will align himself with the values and emotions of others, this may seem like he changing himself just to be liked, but it's literally a function that helps humans harmonize with each other. Now where your friend is individuality is located will be in his thoughts. This is due to the fact that he has Ti, although it may be inferior Ti, it is still a subjective internal logical framework. It is not easily affected by the thoughts of other people unless it's verified to be true by his own standards. If you want to get know his individual self inquire more about his thoughts especially when your one on one."
1626,isfp,"That's why we have boundaries :) It doesn't make you a bad person to cut out toxic people, and maybe it's something you want to construct your identity around, it's a healthy attitude to adopt.  Hard part is labeling somebody as toxic when it's actually our own fears of judgment, but it sounds like you already have that figured out.
Honestly, you don't sound rude, sometimes things just come out wrong.  Something I really love about my best friend is that he always apologizes later after he's had time to calm down.  ""To err is human.  To forgive, divine."""
1627,isfp,"I have a friend thats an ESFJ.If I walk somewhere,she'll usually follows me.She's very optimistic and laughs at my usually lame jokes.Though,she likes to gossip about my other friend(that is a possible INTJ).All in all,shes a good friend."
1628,isfp,"They're great in my opinion. Granted my sister is one and she's one of my best friends, and I also have 3 other EXFJ s close to me so I may be biased lol. But ESFJs are amazing. They're attentive, considerate of you and your needs, warm, keep the mood up, socially intelligent, supportive, etc. They make you feel important. They're one of the best friends you could have, and they're very good at offering practical advice to boot. One of the most underrated types in my opinion. I feel so lucky to have them in my life."
1629,isfp,"Haven't got a good experience with ESFJs. I usually am attracted to them a LOT at first, but then can less and less stand them. I've known two who were absolute trash tier. My dad (ESFJ 3w2), and an ex-friend (ESFJ 2w3). Both of them seem to be on the unhealthy end of the spectrum. I find that when I'm really deep into depression, I can fall into that ESFJ shadow and I grow to act just like them, though it's not my true self.
My dad doesn't know how to think for himself, though he's nowhere near a bad guy. He's a pathological liar as well, so I can't really trust him. Everytime he's with a new woman, he morphs into a version of himself to please her, and he can totally give up hobbies or tastes he used to have when he was alone, just so he can be ""perfect"" for her. He has control issues as well, and that's part of why I can't stand him anymore. He's waaaay over-the-top sweet with me and that gets on my nerves too. He will do anything to please people and preserve outer appearances, and there's nothing authentic in his demeanor.
My ex-friend was probably a narcissist. She's the type of person to be very friendly and warm at first, have a lot of ""friends"", who, I think, are more likely to be good acquaintances rather than anything, and be somewhat cheesy in her tastes. Much like my dad. She morphed into a perfect version too. We had a lot in common, until I found, day after day, that actually we were pretty opposite. When we hit the 3-month mark of being friends, she started being increasingly weirder, started being snarky and critical of everything I did, and her control issues (as well!) showed up. If things didn't go her way, she'd get either on the verge of a breakdown or she would get angry and take it out on me. She ended up screaming at me for a stupid reason, degraded and insulted me, until she discarded me when I called her out on her bullshit. I don't know what's become of her, and I don't care anymore. I stopped caring when she told me a very degrading thing a while before our fight."
1630,isfp,"idk,but as an infp i find myself using si just as much as i use ni?,so how often do you guys use ni?,and could you sometimes be mistaken as an intuitive like an infp on tests because perhaps you use ni so much but infact you isfps?"
1631,isfp,"i always feel it ""there"" during my daily life and it helps me realize truths + patterns about the world around me that i cant really put into words. it helps w my understanding of the world and ppl, as well as how to react to certain situations"
1632,isfp,"I'm always horny, always. And it's hard for my ISTJ boyfriend to keep up anymore, so now we're in an open relationship so I can experiment more and have the opportunity to have sex more often (which hasn't really been the case, thanks to my Introversion.... even though there's Tinder, I end up second guessing 9/10 times and don't meet up)"
1633,isfp,"yes. I don't have sex much though, because I'm single and don't do much other than go to work and the gym. not even really sure where to look. maybe i'll try dating apps later when my life is not a mess"
1634,isfp,The struggle is real! I would happily get into a relationship with another sp. it might seem crazy from the outside but I think it would awesome with all the crazy shenanigans! Now just to lose the introversion to find one...
1635,isfp,"i'm seasonal. i had a frustrating gig watering the flowers on the beachfront. bikinis everywhere. im all hot and bothered after lugging around 40kilo of hose about (love them hose), then finally let that liquid life gush out of my massive lance."
1636,isfp,"unpopular opinion incoming:
having an unusually high sex drive is basically rooted in not feeling truly loved. youre addicted to sex because it gives you a rush of oxytocin which you are generally lacking in.
source: i am a person with an unusually high sex drive who doesnt feel genuinely loved.
what is helping: allowing myself to be loved by God"
1637,isfp,"The struggle is real, mang. You pretty much have to couple up with another SP if you wanna stay sexually satisfied but then you gotta deal with the volatility and drama of two SPs together. üò©
P.S. ISFJ? Girl what are you thinking? SJs have sex for reproductive purposes or maybe just to score a mate. But it‚Äôs not really their thing and they can‚Äôt keep up the charade for long. SJ marriages wind up in Deadbedroomville, true story."
1638,isfp,"We didn't want to try an open relationship. We've been together for 6 years and I just want to get married to him already, but it's put a huge strain on our relationship. 
We thought we'd just try finding a unicorn, someone to join us in sex. But it just prooved much too difficult. So I suggested we try an open relationship. It's nothing official, we don't tell friends or family, and we aren't really actively seeking people to sleep with, so it just feels like a normal relationship, but then if either of us would like to sleep with someone else we have permission to. But there are a lot of ground rules which we had to go over first."
1639,isfp,"We still have sex once or twice a week, but I'd much rather like 3 times a day or more.
We once had sex 18 times in a day (no I'm not over exaggerating - it was insane, definitely couldn't do it that much again). So it started off strong, but I've stayed horny and he's struggled to keep going at that pace."
1640,isfp,"Bruh, that‚Äôs such a stereotype. I was in a dead bedroom with an ISFP, and not because of me. I know it‚Äôs not me, because he was also in a dead bedroom with his ex, by his own confession. 
My sex drive and kinks have been higher than all my partners."
1641,isfp,"yeah that's true, though there are some things I should sort out before trying.  every time I use an app it seems kind of overwhelming in a weird way,  then I delete it after a few days. 
I don't know, maybe I'll try again in a few months. I have noticed that some apps seem more promising than others"
1642,isfp,"Im happy for you! But I think most of us were raised with an inaccurate idea of what love actually is. I noticed from your post history you struggle with anxiety, so Im just gonna leave you with this.
There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love. ‚Äî 1 John 4:18"
1643,isfp,"There are a couple -
Here's a sample, I have already been heavily criticized about these rules in a few different sex positive forums, in which people abused me saying I was immature and controlling, they wouldn't touch me with a 10ft pole, etc. So please be kind. This took weeks of planning and both of us are really happy with it and each other, as are the people we've had sex with.
We can always rewrite and rediscuss these rules 
We talk to each other if we are talking to/ meeting up with someone 
If someone wants to join the two of us for a threesome... Awesome 
No meeting of people's parents/ friends where avoidable. 
If either of us gets uncomfortable being in an open relationship we stop. 
Everything is situational and we are to be mature and open at all times when discussing this topic with each other and our SP's (sex partner)
No sex in our bed 
Always practice safe sex - I actually broke that rule already, but we discussed it and worked through it.
These rules and our relationship must be shared with whomever we decide we want to sleep with 
The majority of sex should still be had between us 
Dates/ hanging out is allowed 
Sending nudes is okay 
You can't have sex with the same person multiple times a week (in which you are staying over the night)
If one of us is having sex with someone else it doesn't mean the other has to go out and have sex with someone 
Our relationship has top priority always.
Get tested regularly."
1644,isfp,"this sub is where i come when i want to chill on reddit.
on all the other subs there are little moderators poking their eyes around making sure everyone is following the rules and shit
idk if this sub even has mods though. it is just very chill
this reminds me of the buddhist subreddit tbh"
1645,isfp,"Other than doing tests online (are they accurate?), what general characteristics and small details do ISFPs have or do? From online tests, im an ISFP and i do relate to most of the descriptions. However i do not feel im artistic in any way. Cant draw, take nice photos, dance or play any instruments. Please share on how you identify ISFPs!!! So i can confirm i am one and also to identify others irl. Thanks!!"
1646,isfp,"I‚Äôm not creative in an artsy way, but I do care very much about aesthetics. I love taking pictures, and I love decorating the inside of my house. The artsy part of the ISFP description used to make me question my results, but when you focus on the main functions and how you utilize them you may see that the specific typing of personality types (artsy for us) aren‚Äôt going to fit us all. Hopefully this helps :) 
I‚Äôm still relatively new to this, I‚Äôve seen it explained in detail by some of the folks on here in a more elegant way but I have to learn more. "
1647,isfp,"I've noticed that they are (in movies or series) depicted as detectives, policemen, lawyer; anything that involves feelings/principles and Se output; Also being involved/engaged in Se stimulating activities often, clubbing, doing sports, hiking etc"
1648,isfp,"Functions stack for ISFP's is Fi Se Ni Te, ISFJs is Si Fe Ti Ne. They're very very different. ISFP's care very much about authenticity due to their dominant Fi and may appear quirky. Whereas ISFJs care very much about routine Si and Harmony Fe. Both are very functional in the real world. I would say that ISFJs are more open about their feelings because they have a balanced judgement axis, but less open to new experiences. ISFP's whilst care very much about authenticity, keep their true feelings quite hidden but have a balanced perceiving axis and are usually in my experience extremely intelligent. "
1649,isfp,"They are very different indeed. While both introverts, when together the ISFJ will likely be more talkative. ISJFs are extremely organized and diligent and tend to think and speak at a faster pace than ISFPs (in my experience at least). ISFJs are good at making decisions, ISFPs like to mull things over for a while. "
1650,isfp,"Well, not all ISFJ's are necessarily open with their feelings - a lot of ISFJ's actually aren't, for a number of reasons (as an ISFJ, I'm not always open about my feelings because I feel that it will disrupt the status quo or upset another person, for example.)  I think you make a great point here in what you're saying about the ISFJ-ISFP difference!  I've noticed that ISFP's tend to be more impulsive than ISFJ's - my ISFP friends are usually down for anything that sounds fun.  "
1651,isfp,"Hmmm yes maybe I should rephrase, Fe shows emotions on the outside, so even if ISFJs aren't intentionally displaying their emotions, Fe makes it a lot easier to deduce their emotions. Personally as an ENFP that's something that's quite enviable because Fi means I naturally keep them hidden so when I do express them through Te it comes across very intense. Like a bottle of coke that has been shaken and opened, it's an explosion, and that's what I tend to notice with the Fi-Te axis. Whereas Fe-Ti in my experience is more frequent but smaller, your desire for harmony means that you know that in the long run its better to express yourself bit by bit. "
1652,isfp,"Hello everyone. I've identified as ISTP for a while and most of the time fit in quite well and matched all the descriptions almost perfectly. However when I was testing myself via the Jung functions I was in favour of being ISFP. I know its not far from being ISTP but I've never ever thought of myself as being a feeling kind of person. I imagine myself as a cold hard person who shows no emotion. 
Are there any non feeling kind of ISFPs out there? Because this just doesn't add up"
1653,isfp,"I think I'm a ""non-feeling"" ISFP -- I guess I care a lot about the feelings of others, and my own feelings, but I don't necessarily show that side of myself to other people, or easily open up about it."
1654,isfp,"IDK, I always get different results on test better to just compare yourself. No not really I think that's one of the things that separates ISFPs and ISTPs. 
Also how they behave in conflict which ISFPs sucks at and will avoid it afraid of hurting others, while ISTPs will look to fix it and will be more blunt on what the problem is. "
1655,isfp,Fi actually shows little emotion. Ti females show a lot of emotion just because that's what society wants from them and inferior Fe makes them do it. Ti males don't show emotion as much though. Both are pretty emotionally centered.
1656,isfp,"I (38/f/infj) started seeing a guy (40/m), for pretty much Netflix and chill. It was really what I wanted at the time but over time I realized how rare and precious he actually is. Reading articles about Introverts, it dawned on me he's most likely an ISFP. I never try to type people, it just kinda happened as I read the info about the ISFP (you guys are totally precious, btw). 
Anyway, our meetings were going great. Hanging out was cool with no pressure, sex and making out were like whoa. But a few times I would bring up doing stuff out and about - going to a gallery crawl, drinks off the beaten path. Things I thought might interest him (he's into art). He'd say yes, however plans fell through every time, usually the day of.
Being a mature adult, I took a hint. It wasn't the end of the world for me if he wanted to keep it purely casual. But I wanted to be sure and he's one worth trying. I also thought maybe he did really like me, but maybe this is an ISFP thing that I totally misrepresented. It's just when he kisses me I feel like he's really into me (I can't kiss someone I feel ""meh"" about, much less make out with them for hours). I can tell he's genuinely thoughtful and kind. He's comforted me when I felt bad about something even if it was something small. Like how could I not fall for this guy.
Anyway, I needed to know if I should maybe try to keep some emotional distance because I realized I was falling for him. I asked, over text, if I should stop asking about doing something (besides hanging out at his place). I said either way was fine, just didn't want to keep bothering him with invites if he just wasn't into it. He answered ""we'll talk later"".
I don't know what to make of this. I was trying to not put him on the spot, thus texting instead of asking him face-to-face. But the ambiguous response is baffling me. I can't tell if he means it and we will hang out again or if he's just letting me down softly to try to spare my feelings. 
I haven't answered, it's been about 5 days. Usually we only text if we're making plans to see each other, but at this point I don't know what to do. 
In the past if I felt his interest in me was waning I'd stop texting completely, and eventually I'd hear from him and things would be like before.
Tldr: infj trying to figure out if ISFP at all interested due to ambiguous response"
1657,isfp,"I mean, he definitely sounds into you. You sound great and all. 
I can see why you‚Äôd be questioning things now though. Trouble is, we hate plans. Which would explain the ‚Äúplans start well but always fall off‚Äù. God - I‚Äôm an absolute sinner when it comes to that. I genuinely want to do stuff, and plan it, but as it approaches I just feel like ‚Äúagh.. idk..‚Äù 
I think with ISFPs we often take a while to get comfortable and really express. Sounds to me like he‚Äôs interested, just wants to be sure. When he knows, I can promise you, he‚Äôll express it. We often have this thing of wanting to be with someone, but scared of making it official. So we‚Äôre like ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs do all this relationship stuff cause I love you! But I‚Äôm too scared to put a label on it..‚Äù. Perhaps it‚Äôs childish, and unfair. And personally I‚Äôm trying to work on it. But it sounds like something you‚Äôll just have to try cope with. Were casual people who don‚Äôt like feeling confined.
It‚Äôs up to you what you do really. If you want to be with him, I‚Äôd say just keep things the way they are, but slowly introduce more maybe? For example don‚Äôt just dump everything on him and pressure him. Just stay how you are, stay relaxed, but slightly start upping the seriousness. If you‚Äôre okay with being patient (and also knowing that there isn‚Äôt a certainty that it will work), then you‚Äôll be fine! Because I can promise you again, if he does come around, once he‚Äôs certain, he‚Äôll love you till the day he dies. But reiterating again, you can‚Äôt be certain that will happen. So it‚Äôs your call if you‚Äôre okay with that. 
I‚Äôm not sure how much this helped but eh I‚Äôll answer more questions if you need! You actually sound very mature and understanding of it all already, so I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be fine. Go with what you feel. Good luck to you - I sincerely hope all goes well :)"
1658,isfp,"As an ISFP I feel deflated by clear plans and also the pressure to not come off as ambiguous. Both those are pretty draining.
‚Äã
Also it is pretty important for me to get out and do things, but I'm often resistant to the first step needed for it. I'm highly pressure prompted, (but I think only if it is towards something that aligns with my values).
‚Äã
One possibility is you make a plan and surprise him with it."
1659,isfp,"Not an ISFP but have dated an ISFP before and have an ISFP brother. He sounds afraid to commit because of some reason (who knows what it is) because otherwise it's unlikely he'd say something as cryptic as ""we'll talk later."" Do you know his relationship history? You might need to just give him time to figure out his feelings for you. Wish I could be more helpful!"
1660,isfp,"My initial thought is that I would be seriously peeved by that response. 
It sounds like you're investing more into this relationship than he is - that doesn't necessarily make him bad, some people like things to stay casual and lowkey (personally I'd be way more psyched if a friend suggested coming over to watch movies and order pizza than if they invited me out to eat). But you are putting energy into planning things to do together, looking forward to it, and then being disappointed, and now you are reaching out for input and getting essentially radio silence ('we'll talk later' and 5 days of nothing else).
Even being ISFPs we can't read his mind, only make guesses about his behavior. One thought is that he wants to discuss this in person - I would suggest reaching out and asking to meet/hang out, and specify you want to 'talk' as alluded to in the previous message. If you want to save a little face you can apologize for being busy (so it comes off less like 'I waited for you to say something else for 5 days and you said nothing so now I am the one reaching out again' and more like 'oops, meant to respond but I'm so busybusybusy!').
I'm pessimistic so if somebody did this to me I'd 100% think they didn't want to hang with me XD. But for myself, I've definitely cancelled last minute on a lot of invites because I was feeling crummy that day, or because it sounded like a lot of effort to drag myself out of bed and then get dressed up and blah blah blah... 
It's possible he has issues with things being planned so far in advance. I know I can sometimes more easily do things spur-of-the-moment/ the day-of than I can stuff I've had on the calendar for a week. I think sometimes it's because it's low pressure? A way to reduce that would be to invite him to things you're going to do anyway, or to suggest going out to do things when you're hanging out.
The thing is, though, you can't know if he's feeling any of these things without him telling you. So again, I would make one more effort to reach out, see what he says, and proceed from there. Any kind of response tells you something."
1661,isfp,"he's probably dealing with something else in his life, I have flaked a lot before to invites that I genuinely wanted to do but couldn't get myself to go to them for other reasons. usually just something was in my head that made me feel like I couldn't go. I can't describe that feeling, but looking back I have flaked a lot of invites for what are probably dumb reasons.  everyone is different though, who knows what's happening
It might be worth reaching out to him in a few days and see how he's doing, but who knows what he's dealing with or doing, and he might not even respond. I always try to respond(I hate ghosting and being ghosted) personally but I can see situations where I'd have a hard time doing that"
1662,isfp,"I haven‚Äôt seen this mentioned but it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs broke and too embarrassed to say so, especially if he‚Äôs conventional (and many of us are) and thinks the dude should pay for dates.
When I was struggling and single I would never go out with friends and stuff if it looked like I might wind up paying to do a bunch of stuff I couldn‚Äôt afford...especially when I absolutely loved staying at home and could do that for free. üò©"
1663,isfp,"I'm an ISFP married to an INFJ for 10 years now.  The INFJ by the way is the rarest of the MBTI, so you're pretty rare and special yourself.  For the most part we don't like being boxed in and early in a relationship he may feel your plans are boxing him into commitments.  Even if you think you're giving him space, depending on the level of ISFP he is, it may feel that way to him.  I'd say be content with hanging out watching Netflix's and such, let him start feeling comfortable around you, then he'll open up but it takes some patience.  We are adventurers we do like to do things but we're spontaneous, I can't make a commitment to save my life a week from now.  I get anxious just thinking about having to do it.  However I love to do hikes, trips and concerts with my INFJ planning them however is a bit tough sometimes.
You've got some differences, he probably only likes to hear factual stuff that are concrete.  My INFJ is a bit of a conspiracy theorist, she thinks and talks about a lot of stuff sometimes I just can't get into.  But I can't tell her that because I don't like to cause any conflict.  With that said, I totally blew her off on the MTBI stuff for a few months she was trying to tell me how rare she was and I wasn't paying much attention to it.  Not until I seen how passionate she was on the subject did I finally feel the need to relate to her more on this.  I finally took the time to learn about MTBI.  But it was on my own time and not by being told to check it out.   As an ISFP I just don't jump when told to do something I'm not that into.  Now I really understand it, I took 3 MTBI test from 3 different sites, they all had different questions yet every single site said I was an ISFP and the description was dead on to my personality.  Thats when it became concrete fact that something is right about this stuff.  Which then allowed me to open up and listen to what she is telling me.
INFJ's are such caring people, more often caring about others before themselves.  Not meaning to sound pretentious here but I really need that.  I love to feel loved and I love being told she loves me.  ISFP want to be appreciated but they aren't going to ask for it.  Unfortunately though we will let ourselves get down, if we don't feel the love and appreciation.  She's a planner and sometimes now in our relationship I really need that (it wasn't always like that though).  I don't like to take the lead, so overtime with her I have learned to really appreciate her planning nature.  To me the INFJ is my perfect counterpart, she helps me be a better person.  Unfortunately she doesn't always feel the ISFP in me is her perfect counterpart and that can be tough.  She confuses me to be a narcissistic controlling person sometimes, even though I would never hurt her or anybody else for personal gain.  I really don't like it when she calls me that :(
Because I have such strong beliefs in facts and am very concrete, I can seem controlling and will shut down on a disagreement.  Sounds like he shut down on you if he's not responding to texts.  Try and figure out what shut him down or just try and tell him how appreciative you are of him.  We like that, we need it because we really beat ourselves up.  We never feel like we are good enough and constantly underestimate our abilities. So feeling needed is very important as an ISFP.  Being told how appreciative one is to me can be very rewarding to the person telling the ISFP that.  We really do like to give and care, even more so when we know it's appreciated and loved.
Good luck, I truly wish you the best."
1664,isfp,"INFJ. Married to ISFP since 2013. The shut downs are normal. This is not the last you‚Äôll see of it. If you want to be with him, get used to it. Since their feelings are oriented inwards, they dislike communicating their feelings, too. Be prepared for this. Sorry, I have no solutions, just warnings."
1665,isfp,"I mentioned earlier,  I try to plan things because I function better with planned activities.  It's very helpful to see things from the other side and appreciate the insight. Gives me a little bit of hope, haha 
I'm actually very patient with avoidant types because I have been avoidant myself, all my life. Only recently got better about recognizing it and being better about it. It's funny, I'm not trying to get married or escalate things to that level in any way with this him. Maybe I need to tell him that so he's not so terrified."
1666,isfp,"yes I agree. I don't know what his situation is, but sometimes I am scared to commit or take it further with people. kind of just depends how I'm feeling and what's going on in my life.
there's someone I'm interested in(and she seems interested in me too), but I've been avoiding her because I am not feeling the best about myself and my situation lately. also sometimes i just don't know what to say"
1667,isfp,"I don't know about his past relationships, nor him about mine. I kinda like that we just live in the present. But yes, it may be insightful to know where we've coming from, if things got more serious. Honestly I myself need to figure out my own relationship goals. I'm not trying to get married or anything that serious, and I think I need to tell him that if we do have a chance to ""talk later""."
1668,isfp,"Yup, that's part of my confusion - he may just be a super sweet person, like you said. I've been in those shoes before, I go out of my way for people and I'm just being decent and nice, with no romantic intentions, and it confuses people.  Guess I'm tasting my own medicine lol"
1669,isfp,"Thanks, I appreciate it. I can relate to emotionally shutting down because I've been that way all my life, until recently. Someone is right there, asking what's wrong, but I was already literally locking myself in the bathroom fleeing questioning. Fun times! Not really, it was  an awful mess."
1670,isfp,"No I understand that, I‚Äôm not saying you should put up with his avoidance just cause it‚Äôs him. If you‚Äôre okay with it then great! But if not, you don‚Äôt have to just accept it. But that‚Äôs down to you. 
The fact you aren‚Äôt trying to escalate anything that far may help - tell him that! Though it could make him feel bad if he doesn‚Äôt feel alone. We don‚Äôt really like being ‚Äúshared‚Äù I guess you could say. But him knowing you also want to take it slow will help so it‚Äôs worth mentioning!"
1671,isfp,"haha, sounds like you are planning.  ISFP really live in the present moment.  Really hard for us NT future thinkers to understand.  Not sure what you INFJs think about, but you probably like to plan.  Imagine, to block out anything in the future and outside the range of your vision, and only see/react to what is before you right now.  wow, blows my mind."
1672,isfp,"I've only been seeing him, but it's not really because I'm so into him. I've been wondering if I should be seeing other people, while he makes up his mind. I guess that's the smart thing to do? I just don't have the energy or time to juggle multiple men tbh"
1673,isfp,"I feel you. I mean, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd like you seeing other men, but that doesn‚Äôt make it wrong. If that‚Äôs what you wanna do, go for it. But if you choose to be with him you have to make sure that‚Äôs a 100% choice. Because if he chooses to be with you, it‚Äôs a 10000% choice. Keep it casual for the moment anyway - you both sound happy with it!"
1674,isfp,"As an ISFP I like to observe and analyze social interactions. I always notice when an extrovert leaves and the rest of the group suddenly feels uncomfortable. I personally struggle with leading a conversation, and I was wondering, what would happen if a bunch of ISFPs got together?
What would it look like in a group of 2-3 people?
4-7?
10+? 
Would we all sit around awkwardly hoping for someone else to lead the conversation?"
1675,isfp,We would all either be doing something together which encourages conversation already (like a game) or we would all be doing our own thing in silence but in each other's company while occasionally making interesting remarks which might turn into conversations. 
1676,isfp,"Everything about this post is so me...(hey hi I came from r/infp, I've kinda been thinking I'm more ISFP). 
People think it's weird when I say I actually like being the ""third wheel"" not with a romantic couple but if I'm with two other good friends. I like how they can lead conversations and I can stick my wry comment or something sarcastic in when Ithink it fits. I hate one-on-one things with friends (unless we are both distracted playing a game or something). Is this an ISFP thing?
Btw I find it really hard to find people who want to just chill and we each do out own thing and be alone together.  "
1677,isfp,"My best friend is very extroverted so I think it works well when we hang one on one. We're constantly finding new things to do together.  I almost feel like as long as I'm comfortable with the other person, one on one hangouts can be better because I don't let myself hide behind the scenes while everyone else runs the conversations. "

1679,isfp,"I'm so confused! I'm very strongly ENFP and therefore I do realize I can come across as intense and maybe too out there, which I feel like sometimes overwhelms this guy, but we also sometimes find ourselves having these random deep conversations where we're a little too honest, but then I feel like he gets weird and won't ever again directly address what we talked about, almost like those conversations are blips in time that don't fit anywhere on the chronological timeline of our friendship, and I feel like afterwards he regrets having opened up. I like these conversations but sometimes it feels like moving backwards, like he doesn't know how to be as lighthearted and humorous around me anymore, at least not without a little bit of effort. He has a little trouble picking up on cues, I think, but when I mentioned something that bothered me he took it very seriously, and I also realized that he generally takes things I say very seriously, even though I have reassured him that I sometimes say things randomly without thinking. He has attempted initiating interactions, I think, in somewhat of a quiet way, but not very directly, so I can't be sure if I can take that as a good sign. Sometimes I just want to talk and talk to him so I can get everything out but I feel like that would completely scare him off and get him to ignore me completely, so I've tried keeping some distance to give him a chance to talk to me instead of me initiating like I usually do, and it did lead to him actually reaching out a bit. He also compliments me sometimes (on appearance), but I do feel like I generally annoy him unintentionally and I don't really know what to do to garner the opposite reaction. Help?"
1680,isfp,"Hello, ISFP dude here. I've dated two ENFP's before and they were some of my best relationships. You guys make a relationship really fun for an ISFP. But on with the advice. In my experience, when I like a girl I actually put forth effort into things like compliments, flirting, and trying to have fun with the other person. ISFP's enjoy following a natural progression in life as with relationships I feel and don't want to force anything in anything we do. When we enjoy a girls company, I find that we try to be subtle for better or for worse. If you really like this guy, you should just let him know. He's an ISFP, so the worst he'll say is probably ""Look, you're really pretty and awesome and fun to talk to, but maybe I don't want to date you."" An ISFP will still continue to be your friend if he was friends before. You're best chance is not to try to read to hard into the cues he's giving off and just go for it. The longer the game goes on, the less interested he'll be. Again, this is just all from my point of view and not all facts, but from my personal experience and from talking to other ISFP guys this is true. Wish you the best!"
1681,isfp,"I'm a girl but I feel like the best thing you could just do is be straight up. Maybe this is just a me thing, but I never know if guys are flirting with me or just being nice. Very very rarely I will blatantly ask because I don't know how to be flirtatious and cutesy without liquid courage so I try being straight forward. Just tell him you are interested because honestly if he is into you he's constantly thinking about it anyway. There's a guy I work with right now that I feel like might be flirting with me but I seriously just can't tell. Whenever I'm around him I just want to ask but at the same time I don't want to jump to conclusions and make things awkward. 
So to answer your question, you won't know until you ask. "
1682,isfp,"Yup, strong cues :D
I've been in a lot of situations where the girl is obviously interested, but I kinda happen to bail out of those, because I'm not sure if the girl is just trying to be nice. And I really have a hard time being verbally and physically flirtatious, when the opposing sex shows some kind of interest in an unexpected situation :D"
1683,isfp,"Not very introverted INFP here, married to a very introverted ISFP. My guy cannot tell when he's being flirted with. Like, at all. I had to come right out and say, ""Hey, I like you."" So I agree with EphemeralSpectre's advice. Work up the courage and just go for it. Not too aggressively, but make sure you're clear.
ISFP's have a strong tendency to go with the flow and not impose themselves on anyone. So even if he likes you he's not likely to come right out and say it, especially if he can't tell whether you're flirting/interested or not. Pair this with any insecurities he likely has as a normal human being and you've got someone who likely needs you to be direct with him instead of hinting at your feelings.
Hope this helps, wishing you the best as well!"
1684,isfp,"isfp guy here- I Also cannot flirt at all or tell whenever someone is flirting with me,,, recently this girl was flirting with me (I don't Really know, I think so tho) and I told her that she was stalking me, I felt so bad but those are just the words I said"
1685,isfp,"I also have a hard time flirting. In general, i'm not a very touchy person to begin with so it never feels natural for me to reciprocate touch in a public setting. As for verbally, every so often I'll just be completely blunt. No beating around the bush at all. A few weeks ago I saw the most gorgeous man I have ever seen and I told him ""You are really, really attractive."" I don't even know what came over me, but it had to be said haha."
1686,isfp,"Aw, I'm exactly the same. I consider myself pretty introverted but around my isfp boyfriend I might as well be an enfp. I pretty much hung out with him exclusively for about two months, texted him all the time, straight up told him ""I really like you,"" (he thought I meant as a friend) before I finally freaked out on him and asked him when the hell he was going to kiss me- not my proudest moment.
Thing is, I could tell he had feelings for me the entire time, he was just too shy to initiate, and also afraid he was misreading my signals and didn't want to make things weird between us  if he was wrong. So yeah, I guess if you're waiting on an isfp to make the first move,  you might be waiting a long time."
1687,isfp,"ISFP guy here - fat chance you'll get any cues :( I wish I were more brave in relationships but I always fear that I'm going to make the girl uncomfortable if I'm too forward. In reality you need to just make the moves, and from what I can tell he probably likes you. "
1688,isfp,I think the generations are getting shorter and shorter because of how fast everything is changing... I'm born in '97 but in no way identify with anyone born later than 99 so i'd say I'm a millennial... 
1689,isfp,"I on the contrary relate to people born in the 2000's more than the 80's generation. It will be interesting to see how the ""Gen Z"" will develop. I definitely reject the millennial title, I mean the name makes sense, but all these articles on sites like Buzzfeed really made me not want to ever call myself that(I also hate the ""YAY WE ARE MEELENEALS FUCK BABY BOOMERS GIVE US FREE MONEH"" sentiment). 
The most relatable group for me are people born in the mid to late 90's(I was born in 96)"
1690,isfp,"""Dates are approximate and there is some overlap because there are no standard definitions for when a generation begins and ends.
If your birth date falls on the border between two generations, which one do you pick?
Pick the generation that you relate to the most, and the one you want to be part of.
Why so arbitrary? This is not a precise science with firm definitions."" - Michael T. Robinson

1692,isfp,"I don't know about romantic relationships, but for relationships in general I think the biggest thing is I need to be assured that I'm not a nuisance, or I end up pulling away. Actions I find are the best to get this across, because I'm quite distrustful of people's words. Though if it's really well said, words can be just as effective.
Also, in the early stages of any relationship I'll very rarely be the one to initiate conversations, activities, etc. Later though, once I'm 100% sure it's going to work out fine, I'll be outgoing enough to be an extravert, lol.
I also think it's important to let the ISFP have their alone time, but be careful if they start to withdraw too often, because they may be nervous to talk to you for some reason. So if that happens, don't get angry, but definitely reach out and try and get things rolling again. This one may not be an ISFP thing in general, but I may as well put it here in case it is, other people can verify it or say it's not an ISFP thing."
1693,isfp,"Been in a successful relationship with an ENTJ for 7 years which I have recently read would not work because we are complete opposites. I think we respect and admire each other's differences to the point that love was very easy to blossom. I help him achieve his goals with my emotional intuitiveness and intellect and don't cramp his style because I am self sufficient. I respect his focused and driven demeanor and his assertiveness was quite flattering in the early stages when he was pursuing me. So I'm the confident competent support system that he needs and he adds to my life by imparting some of his focus onto me and inspiring me to step out of my comfort zone and experience a different way of doing and seeing things. 
For myself I needed
Deep discussion about philosophical ideas, past present future kinda pondering - basically connecting on a deep emotional level 
Fun adventurous dates - never want to get bored or feel stuck in a rut 
Core values must be in sync and have a partner willing to listen, learn and grow together. Hope this helps- just learnt about this psychology stuff today and this is my first reddit post yay"
1694,isfp,"Our dominant Fi gives us strong moral ideas, and a difference in viewpoint to us can potentially cause conflict. We most likely want to be open-minded however, and accept when we are wrong, and the best way to do that is to appeal to our Te.
Explain your side of any argument in a logical concise manner, in a way that doesn't target us personally. That's the best way to change my viewpoint about something, anyway. Personally, I don't like any kind of conflict, but in any kind of long relationship I'd prefer for the other to be honest (instead of holding grudges) so that I could feel comfortable doing the same. It's a little similar to what people have been saying so far, being honest about how you feel to your ISFP can reassure them that they're not a nuisance, at make them feel more comfortable with opening up to you."
1695,isfp,"It's weird because I'm at the very beginning of a relationship with an ISFP but I (ENFP) am still very irritated and intrigued by the whole concept of their need for alone time; if it was up to me I'd spend 24/7 with people I like. I give her as much freedom as she likes though and don't act bothered. Sometimes it leaves me yearning though and self-doubts start kicking in. I feel like if we were just sitting in the same room without much interaction it wouldn't be a problem but I'm probably wrong about that.
It gives me the feeling of not knowing how we would get along when spending more time together. I want to get to know her world and show her mine and this privacy holds me back. I guess I am just too impatient. 
Don't you guys feel a need to get to know eachother from all sides too? How big is your need for alone time? (she literally can't meet up more than twice a week). Do you go for slow starts in relationships?"
1696,isfp,"my best friend is an ISFP and has ADD. i notice that she uses drawing to calm herself down, and biting on pencils (or anything) during work keeps her focused. something to stimulate the brain that won't harm herself."
1697,isfp,"TLDR: I can really relate to some of things that normal ISFP that make me feel normal and that its not just me having ADD being the nreason why I might fuction a certain way. And I dont think it matters much what type you are to find coping skills. There is plenty of resouces out there that might help. 
I have innattentive ADD. Firstly let me say that I one of the things I like about communities like this that it makes me feel like a normal person. And I like to say thank you. As far as coping goes, Im perscribe to meds which can make me less emotional and it helps alot with focus with reading, doing homework and stuff like driving. But I Still find it hard to pay attention to a teacher teaching something. I find that I just prefer to do the work and read intructions as I go along. Or if they teach while we get through the work. But other than that, if someone is talking about something interesting I feel like I can listen in.
But other than that. Im not sure if what personally type you are would matter much when it comes to ADD coping skills. There are some helpful resouces the can help. I find that some stuff on /r/ADHD can be helpful.
Sorry if this wasnt much help to you. Its all I could think of. I don't know much coping skill myself. I just take life as it is. "
1698,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD at 7 or 8. I get distracted pretty easily and even after my parents (or anyone else, really) have finished me telling me something and I acknowledge that I have heard what they said, 9 times out of 10 I will ask them to repeat it. Listening to music or chewing on pencils or pens helps a lot."
1699,isfp,"I have seen several doctors over the years, I have been getting treatment for a possible affective disorder and one doctor has thinks I'm ADD with an avoidant personality as well, another think it's schizotypal/avpd/etcetcblabla
I was wondering if anyone had any other dx's besides ADD? I think a lot of symptoms overlap all across the psych spectrum."
1700,isfp,Do you guys have an unexplainable obsession with pinterest??? I just rediscovered it recently and its like running 10+ tumblr blogs with different themes I'm literally drowning in aesthetics I love it
1701,isfp,"I enjoy Pinterest for the most part, I like to make it look super organized and then pick certain board cover themes so my page looks more ~*aEsthetiC~~~  amg
Other than that, it can get lonely without the whole social feature, but that‚Äôs also what makes it so great. Haven‚Äôt seen any drama!"
1702,isfp,"People generally have a lot views. Some people care about a lot of things, and other people could not care less. I have very strong convictions about something...but I am rarely able to articulate it, or my reasoning behind it. I'm not normally one to go and shove my views in other peoples' faces, but discussions do come up where it is appropriate to discuss how I feel about a topic and sometimes people try to shove something down my throat and I'd like to have a well-thought out and reasonable response. Furthermore, in the profession I am getting my degree in I'm likely going to need to defend everything I do, every view point I have.
..I'm just not very good at this. When I start talking about stuff, it never comes out the way I planned it in my head, and sometimes even what I planned in my head wasn't that great.
Am I alone here? Does anyone else have this issue? How do you deal with it?"
1703,isfp,"I have the same problem. It's made worse by the fact that I'm pretty bad at remembering specific details about a lot of things, since I get a lot of information and store in 'gist' form, so any arguments I have usually sound made up since I can only say ""it involves x and y but...""
The only advice I could give is to know your material (or whatever you have to discuss/think is important to discuss) very well, so that you have a lot to draw from in these situations.
I don't know if this is an ISFP problem, since I'm pretty new to the sub, but it sounds like me too."
1704,isfp,"yup.  I can relate.  Sometimes whatever point I have in my head sound perfectly reasonable and should flow easily out of my mouth, but I either can't get it out correctly, or freeze altogether.  If it's a group argument/discussion, I tend to sit back and listen and make a quick point here and there, or try to fit a related joke in there, to alleviate any tensions being created in a heated argument. 
But on public speaking...as mentioned in other comments...no problem...I used to front a band and had to speak to audiences on a regular basis."
1705,isfp,"What I've noticed while browsing here for a little white is that even us ISFP's can be a pretty diverse bunch. While I'm certainly very introverted, I tend to be pretty outgoing with other people. As such, speaking if front of a crowd comes pretty naturally to me. Since I love a good argument from time to time, it doesn't really matter to me.
Ultimately, it kind of depends on what you're arguing about. I usually find out how to express what my opinion is in my head over time. So someone might argue with me and I'll have no idea how to respond. Then the next day it'll still be on my mind, and I'll come up with reasons as to why my stance is valid and supports for it, in case it ever gets brought up.
Sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't. I think the more I did this, the easier it got over time, and I am now able to come up with reasons when I need to.
It also helps to surround yourself with people who like to argue about more abstract topics like Philosophy. That way, you have a lot more to work with, and nobody is really ""losing"" the argument. I got lucky enough to have plenty of practice arguing philosophy with my friends.
Hope this helps somewhat."
1706,isfp,"If it's something I'm well-versed in, I can make a pretty good point.  I'm not very persuasive, but I'm pretty good at at least giving someone a different perspective.  If it's an issue I care too much about, though, sometimes I can't even form words.  I just get silently angry and walk away."
1707,isfp,"I feel as though I'm well rounded/unconclusive and that I can either be a ENFP or ISFP. Taken the test sober, drinking, morning, night. Never the same results.
However I can relate to this. Although, if given enough time, I usually can win the argument. Even though I don't engage in fixing people's erroneous beliefs unless they are part of my clique. And the people I surround myself tend to have very similar ones to begin with. I think one way I've gotten more rational and capable of debating was by reading Socrate's Apology, watching videos of secularism regarding Christopher Hitchens and many anti-theists, knowing fallacies (strawman), and reading much about the science in persuasion and psychology. (wiki cognitive dissonance) 
A good way to look at it is that arguing is a skill, and you can be good at it in different ways. I'm always aware of how feeble the human memory is. Even though I love and enjoy rehearsing in my quiet time explaining something or arguing with an imaginary version of someone. I never do get use those rehearsed moments. But I do it because I feel like I'm expanding some part of my brain. (and that eureka feeling)
One more thing. We can think in fast mode and slow mode. Fast thinking was for quick reflex and survival reasons, and tends to be irrational. Well, look more depth into that as well. There's a book about it too, but that's enough of my input. "
1708,isfp,"Do you want a lesson? Am ENTP, MASTERDEBATER!
Rule 1. You are never wrong unless logic says you are wrong.
Rule 2. Logic is ping-pong and if you understand where the ball is going you can (logically) hit it back by getting to the point.
Rule 3. Memorize the 24 major logical fallacies. Remember that only politicians debase themselves with them.
Rule 4. Remember your opponents statements. A contradiction is like going out of bounds - they are penalized in people's minds and lose ground.
Rule 5. Do not contradict yourself.
Rule 6. Do not concede they are right without defining the exact way in which they are right and how it proves your point.
Rule 7. Be precise in your terminology. Engender a superfluous lexicon - utilize it loquaciously - as appropriate.
Rule 8. Know what the fuck you're talking about or be able to fake it and learn fast.
Debate is like a bunch of Dragonborn shouting at each other on a hill. ""FUS RO DAH!"", ""AD HOMI NEM!"", ""IN COR REKT!"" kickem off with words. Gravity (the people) make it harder to get back up."
1709,isfp,"Hey, thanks for the reply. This was pretty helpful. I'm definitely a pretty social introvert, a lot of the people I know though are generally just surface level conversation holders.

1710,isfp,"When i get particularly stimulated,tense. and energetic/hyper from caffeine,alcohol,etc.

1711,isfp,"Absolutely not. Only if it‚Äôs something big. Usually I just let it slide and get over it but sometimes I‚Äôll snap and try to attack their feelings. 
If I do plan to bring something up I usually take days to make sure I know exactly what I want to say and how. But I hate doing it."
1712,isfp,"We have a bad rep for being overly subjective and emotional but for me, everything I believe has to pass a truth test, be it moral, experiential, or empirical, and I think that's the way it is for many of us because Te (assuming functions are valid).  So it's not like I just latch on to some arbitrary notion and call it my truth.  I appreciate and value cold, hard fact and logic, but I can't seem to think linearly enough to get the words that come out of my mouth match the string of info in my brain.  Maybe a sign of true intelligence is the ability to properly articulate all that.  I would never subject myself to a debate, but I'm a lot more satisfied learning than relating, which ironically is the point of this post-- to see how my fellow isfps feel about our rep and what really goes on in our heads."
1713,isfp,"I feel conflicted having isfp as my type because of how logical I perceive myself to be, especially when it comes to morality. I'm a practical thinker and a scientist, I've always been great at problem solving and seeing all sides to every issue. However, I'm hopeless at articulating myself. I don't understand how all this relates to my isfp but I don't have a solid understanding of the complex interplay between different traits."
1714,isfp,"I feel similarly to both concepts. I enjoy debating (online) because it helps harness my Te. My bf is INTP so I kind of get less emotions and more logic when he's around. Lots of Thinking friends now that I think of it.. almost exclusively.
I definitely find myself being a very emotional person. No matter how much I enjoy logic and reason, I find it hard to handle when I lead Fi."
1715,isfp,"My brother is an ISFP and he's very logical and interested in the truth. But he figures it out based on his own experiences, if that makes sense, while other MBTI probably figure it out with other functions (as Ne dom for example, I like hearing about other peoples' experiences). "
1716,isfp,it depends on the issue for me. i will argue the hell out of a personal conflict or a moral issue because i feel like those things are our strong suit. but don't ask me to debate economics or anything like that; all i know how to do is turn it into a moral issue so it can be debated.

1718,isfp,I'm debating whether or not to get into a relationship with an ISFP and was wondering how they went about these things...I don't need a detailed story about your sex lives but i would like  honest answers. And also how do isfp communicate that they want a future with you If they don't like to think about the future? Like for example  if they want kids or not and stuff like that.
1719,isfp,Ok thank youu I kinda of figured this tbh but like he won't even talk about like anything  and shit with you I mean that's not even planing lol its just ideas I don't like to push the issue with mine because we haven't been together that long. And he's still opening up but I mean I want to be with some that wants the same things as I do
1720,isfp,"When you are writing a comment, next to the post title, to the right, is a downward pointed arrow. You can tap it and it shows the original post. No more needing to remember anything! Just wanted to let you know that in case you didn't already know. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1721,isfp,"I hope u guys are okay with that
According to cognitive functions, we're polar oppositesz but I feel like we're really not so different (I can't even tell which one I am, pretty sure I'm one of the two though)"
1722,isfp,"It seems INTPs and ISFPs both have deep internal worlds, but that they are very different. The INTP has more like an archive of facts and memories. The ISFP has this world of impressions. INTPs can't really figure out the ISFPs, so that is why they are fascinated with them. At least that's what it seems like to me."
1723,isfp,"Type 5 INTJ here.
An ISFP has the same functions as an INTJ, in different order. Which is interesting to see how that effects end result.
I follow most the introverted subs.  Mostly to analyze patterns and see how I relate.  Also, interesting seeing varied perspectives and approaches to problems. Or simply, how different the 'problems' are for certain types."
1724,isfp,"I have very little concrete thoughts going on inside; I have very little reminiscing or thinking about the future. It is almost all just values and whatever pours out of them in the moment. But those values are so comprehensive and reliable that I have come to trust them even without any clear concrete reasons why. I think a major stance of an ISFP is trust in their values because they work, not trust in the justification behind them, and not having any need to prove them to themselves.
‚Äã
So I actually can be super logical or analytical in practice. I'd just get to such an outward expression from the entirely opposite direction from where an INTP typically would. An ISFP would come from the top-down instead of bottom-up."
1725,isfp,Lol I‚Äôll give it a crack from my perspective but it‚Äôs kind of hard to describe. But kind of like how different things feel or seem based on what we see or feel in the moment? Whereas my INTP best friend is just super logical.
1726,isfp,"Thankyou and welcome. Gah. I dont know what i am. The test always shows that i am infp but i feel like isfp. All my actions and way of life is isfp. But on the paper its infp. I am confused. Maybe people are always varying and switching between similar types. But that off topic.
You welcome and thank you!"
1727,isfp,"Hi all, I have a friend who is an Isfp. We dated very briefly but are now just good friends. I feel like hes been in a really bad way ever since he broke up with his ex who he dated before me. Every time I see him, he just looks worse and worse. He used to be one of the most handsome guys I‚Äôve ever met and now he‚Äôs just so thin and just not taking care of himself. We hung out recently and he told me that he just feels tired all the time and uncomfortable, like somethings not right. I remember feeling this after being really heartbroken and I had to take medication to feel like myself again. Recently I asked him how he was doing and he said that his new place took some adjusting to which I feel like is code for not doing so well. I really want to ask him what‚Äôs wrong and if he wants to talk about it, even his ex whom he has never mentioned, but I‚Äôd be fine listening to it if it helps him. I feel like he‚Äôs a very private person who doesn‚Äôt talk to people about much, which may not be very good for him. How do I word this in a way that he will be receptive to? I really do care about him a lot and want to see him get better. Suggestions?"
1728,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and can actually relate too your friend pretty well. ISFPs are generally closed off and hard to get too. We also usually like to try to do things alone. So, it's going to be very hard to get him to open up since he probably wants to work this out by himself.
Honestly, don't push him to open up. Generally we don't like doing something because someone told or wants us to. Again, we like doing it on our own, so just try to make it very easy for him to open up when he wants to. So in all reality, just be there for him. There's no way you can really completely fix things though, some stuff like this he might just need to take time and work things out for himself."
1729,isfp,"Not sure you will read my comment but  I'm going to comment on your post anyway because i think it is an important post.   I do think it is important that you express your concerns  and ask him if he wants to talk about it.  If he doesn't want to talk about it with you should recommend that he talks about it with a therapist. It is also important that you express your availability and offer to listen to him if he changes his mind.  It can be difficult to deal with a friend who is unwell, so remember to take care of your own health. "
1730,isfp,"Ok. It‚Äôs been almost three years and I feel like things are getting worse. I don‚Äôt really want to fix things, just help him with whatever he needs help with. Could I just text him and ask if everything is ok and just let him know he can talk to me if he wants to?"
1731,isfp,"Thanks! Yeah, I get a notification for this thread. Hmm I forgot about this and haven't talked to him in a while. I agree - I think ISFPs have a stereotype of wanting to be left alone and while that's true, I also get the feeling that my brother does call on me when he really needs help. I hope my friend has someone like that too. Are you an ISFP?"
1732,isfp,"I know one male and one female isfp pretty well and the impression I get from both is they would much rather be on the giving end of that kind of help than the receiving end.
Looked through your profile and you are an enfp (as am I) so I'm guessing you would need to lean on friends when times are tough.
Isfps are more like cats.  They'd prob go off into the woods by themselves or hide under the bed when they aren't feeling well.  Enfps are more like Labradors, if that helps."
1733,isfp,"I don't know why I pussy out when I try to tell her this. We don't really spend time together, and I make her uncomfortable for some reason. I often bother ISFPs, but I don't know why. It's very difficult for me to see into their heads, and they get annoyed and uncomfortable around me. It seems like they feel I just don't ""get it"". I'm trying, but I don't know what they want. Their minds are the most unusual puzzles I've ever seen. It's like their minds are from another dimension. It's so strange.
I think it's important to note that growing up with out of touch, emotionally immature parents and a narc mom in culturally socially strange places is going to have a huge impact on the relationship dynamics of a family, especially when one of the brothers is egotistical, socially unintelligent, and emotionally unintelligent.
The locations operate socially and culturally like they're their own country where everyone is interested in some Netflix show, festival, or occurrence the rest of the country hasn't heard of..It's weird.
My sister seems to want to do her own thing most of the time and often has to deal with conflict from my mom, brother, father, and me.  She'll have people invade in on her space a lot. The problem is we'll need something from my mom, but she'll be around my sister, so we have no choice but to constantly come in the area she's in. Meanwhile, my sister has an unhealthy attachment to my mom.
She seems to have trouble reasoning in the same way INTPs have trouble getting their Ti and Ne to work together at a young age (inferior Te?).
How can I get the balls to tell my ISFP sister our mom is a narcissist? She won't watch or look at anything I try to show her, and I feel uncomfortable explaining it to her. For some reason, she makes me feel uncomfortable when she pays attention and listens to me. I think it has to do with our relationship and the way she pays attention to me. Those big eyes staring so attentively..shivers I'm not used to her behaving so calm, passively, and relaxed and her paying attention to me so directly, much less other people."
1734,isfp,"Just tell her. As straightforward yet gently as possible.
Ultimately, ISFPs prefer information to be presented in a practical manner. It might suck for her to hear it at first, but at least she'll know exactly what's going on with your mom and she can start to rethink some of those unhealthy relationships. "
1735,isfp,"I'm ISFP. ISFP and INTP are totally different. Typically it is characterized by ""mutual misunderstanding.""
They both have deep internal unseen worlds that are utterly foreign to each other.
ISFP: Fi, Se, Ni, Te, Fe, Si, Ne, Ti
INTP: Ti, Ne, Si, Fe, Te, Ni, Se, Fi
See all the opposites!
Learn to love how totally alien the ISFP is. You, even being an INTP that understand a lot, will not be able to understand the ISFP.
And you being the Ti side of it does the analyzing and comes at the interactions with an extra amount of study and consideration. Which it appears you are doing by asking such a question. And then do the exact opposite of what you would think you should do in the exact opposite way that you would do it. That could get you close.
In general ISFP likes to be understood, and you like to understand things. But understanding an ISFP is really hard and really complex. There are probably layers upon layers that you would need to unravel. "
1736,isfp,"LOL, that also is not opposite enough in the right way.
Another good word to describe your possible view of an ISFP is ""enigma""
Also search Personality Cafe ISFP/INTP threads. I think there is a bunch of good discussion there."
1737,isfp,"So she Fis, I Fe. She Ses, I Si. She Nis. I Ne. She Tes. I Ti. She always seems to be Fi-ing. How am I, as a brother, supposed to communicate affectively with that? I don't want to sound like Edgar Allen Poe or some other romantic author. That sounds WAY too formal. Reminds me of Kenny in that Hawaii episode of South Park. I don't want to Fe in an overly deep way either.
How am I, as a brother, supposed to go and explain to her her mom is a narc when she's always in Fi mode and has Se has her second function. If I try to help her or tell her something, I feel like she'll Fi-Se push me away. It always feels like that. How am I supposed to inform her without boring her, annoying her, or being Se pushed away?
I watched a livestream by the way, and apparently FPs don't react to how you feel but to how they feel.
Also, how am I supposed to convince her that her mom is a narc and not make her think I'm something she describes, in her words, as ""weird""? And how am I supposed to inform her about the MBTI in a way that's appealing?"
1738,isfp,"If you are trying to explain too much that it bores her, maybe just get to the point quicker (straightforward and gentle). 
You could try sending her one of those youtube videos about ISFP and see if she thinks it explains who she is. "
1739,isfp,"My ISFP bf said this yesterday and it was the cutest most ISFP thing ever. He was cleaning up all his fishing stuff and had this bowl of fishing line or something that was all curled up. And I was like ‚Äúwhat are you going to do with that?‚Äù And he goes ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just trash‚Äù. Then he starts cutting it into a bunch of smaller pieces and I asked, ‚Äúwhy are you cutting it if you‚Äôre throwing it out?‚Äù And he replies (with such genuine concern that it melts my heart) ‚Äúso it doesn‚Äôt get stuck on some animals‚Äù. Cutest. Ever."
1740,isfp,"I never, ever discard the plastic rings connecting six packs of cans without snipping them up first, so they don‚Äôt catch on the sea turtles when the trash inevitably winds up in the ocean. I saw a marine biology IMAX movie on the subject when I was like eight and never forgot that."
1741,isfp,"Thank you for your reply. Yes, it's hard to have the discipline especially when everyone around isn't vegan. But seriously after watching ""Earthlings"" and ""Cowspiracy"" it's really hard to not be vegan.
However, I think it's really important to arm ourselves with this information so we can make conscious decisions and know the consequences to our actions, especially when it comes to the environment. Maybe challenge yourselves to watch those documentaries, see what you think after?  :)"
1742,isfp,"Hi friends, back again to throw some ideas around and get a few new outlooks! I've recently come into a relationship with an INTJ who I found to be what seemed a polar opposite, and it really got me thinking about how I process information and problem solve as in ISFP. I often feel as though my mind is blank, and after reading about compatibility between INTJ and ISFP, many explained that we are too happy-go-lucky, fun beings who rarely use logic or reasoning when trying to problem solve. I often feel unintelligent (when with INTJ) and often keep quiet when debating, for I always see both sides to a problem, and also can't come to a side that I could sit and prove to be right, it never seems to be worth my energy. This all being said, I was wondering as an ISFP how you feel your brain works? Are there any tips or tricks anyone has to be more ""logical"" or change the way you think? To have more ""intelligent"" conversation, and how to form a strong opinion more often?
Edit: just another question, do any of you feel as though you are too emotional or too deep with your emotions? If not how do you deal with your emotions and process them?"
1743,isfp,"i‚Äôve always felt that this is my biggest ‚Äòdownfall‚Äô. even when i feel like i‚Äôm being intelligent, somebody outsmarts me haha! i‚Äôve found though that instead of trying to seem smarter, i use my ability to see both sides of the situation and offer a ‚Äòdevil‚Äôs advocate‚Äô type of perspective. keeps the conversation going without me having to mentally strain myself haha. or i just simply admit that i don‚Äôt have a clue. "
1744,isfp,"I‚Äôm an ISFP, and I‚Äôm a 22 year old college student, so speaking from personal experience as an ISFP, we appreciate art in a very concrete and physical way, and we are great creators of organic and natural aesthetically pleasing works of art, but ask us to learn the abstract theory behind that art, and we hate it and struggle with it, unless we see an immediately personal sort of gratification and practical application behind doing so. For instance, I‚Äôm an English major, who‚Äôs recently seriously been considering dropping the applied music minor I signed up for because I really struggled with learning music theory and keeping up with the introductory Tonal Harmony and Solfeg√©/Eurythmics courses that I had been taking at the beginning of this fall semester of college before I dropped them because they were just to much trouble trying to keep up with, it felt tedious and stressful trying to do so, as I‚Äôve never played an instrument myself.
 However, I‚Äôm a singer and occasional performer, who‚Äôs been taking private lessons from classically trained professionals for roughly seven years for my own immediate personal gratification and desire of being able to do something that I already loved to do for fun spontaneously better with more potential to be noticed for it by others. I‚Äôve always learned the music totally through imitation. 
Thus, I saw no practical application behind learning anything of music theory beyond the bare basics of being able to read notes and key signatures on a musical staff. I mistook my love for singing and my natural ability to do so well  as something that made me a good candidate for a music minor in college. But it didn‚Äôt. Once I got to having to memorize chordal progressions and having to memorize the sound, placement, and intervals between etc. of each note on a piano and a staff, though, I got seriously overwhelmed, and immediately got lost because I saw no practical application to learning to do so.  Thus, I dropped the Tonal Harmony and Solfeg√©/Eurythmics classes midway through this semester of college, and only kept the Western Music History Survey 1 class because that was straightforward. However, I need the Solfeg√©/Eurythmics and Tonal Harmony classes for the minor, too, and I refuse to try to take those again, especially since I‚Äôm a senior, who‚Äôs already going to have to stay at least one extra semester because I‚Äôm behind on credits for the minor that the institution I‚Äôm attending is forcing me to pursue to graduate (they are making the process of graduating from college so unnecessarily frustrating, and time consuming than it needs to be with this whole minor requirement for graduation bs when it would be as simple as just completing a major and the core liberal arts courses of introductory math,  English, and science requirements at most other liberal arts colleges, and I‚Äôm finally tired of learning about all of these additional requirements to graduate from the institution that I‚Äôve been attending for over the past three years now because the dean/administration is clearly money grubbing). 
Anyway, I got carried away and went off on a tangent over my personal problems online, which is what FI-dominant users often do when they blog or chat online, or at least I‚Äôm an Fi-dom (ISFP), who does, because we don‚Äôt often feel comfortable sharing our deeply held personal values, feelings, opinions, and problems face to face with other people directly, unless we are really close to the other person, or we feel like our personal values are being seriously threatened by them. Otherwise, we‚Äôre a big mystery to other people, unless we feel a close personal emotional connection to them. Even then, when I‚Äôm uncomfortable about talking about my real life personal problems, work, or my future plans for a career and graduating from college, I initially still try to pretend like I‚Äôm totally okay and everything‚Äôs under control because I‚Äôd rather be avoidant, live in my own world on my own terms, be free, be spontaneous, never grow up, focus on fiction, a tv show, a movie, learning to sing a song, or something else totally unrelated because I‚Äôm an Ni-tertiary user, so my own real life future makes me feel uncomfortable and insecure whenever I try to face it directly. 
Thus, whenever I deliberate about my future plans for graduation and a career, even my immediate future, like homework for class on a daily basis a few days ahead of time before they are due, I tend to put it off till the last minute, anyway, gain personal experience that totally changes my perspective and feelings about pursuing said goal, and/or learn about every obstacle that I need to overcome in order to accomplish the goal I want a little too late, I feel bad, impatient, insecure, restricted, and powerless over my own future that every authority figure/superior in my life keeps dictating for me in college. Because it‚Äôs not high school, it‚Äôs not like I can just let my professors and teachers spoon feed me with help and support that will get me to a clear cut goal that they have for me in their minds  that pretty much secures my future graduation within four years, so long as I play along do homework on a regular basis, and follow their rules, I can also still be able to get away with being spontaneous, carefree, and have time to have fun and relax by just being myself and doing my own thing in my spare time. 
Most college professors and advisors don‚Äôt do that, though. You are expected to take initiative for yourself, and fulfill their requirements for graduation, though. My college takes it a step further than most, though as a somewhat renowned private liberal arts college in Cleveland with a hefty tuition price by having all these superfluous graduation requirements, making me  jump through all these hoops to get from what I want to be a relatively painless, smooth, swift, and spontaneous point A to point B graduate from my school within less than five years that my college is making more restrictive then I feel is necessary when I simply just want to get through ASAP and get it over with, and needing to look for an internship/future career all make me go into an overwhelming gloom and doom mind state of fears of incompetence, insecurities, and potential failure.  I don‚Äôt like dwelling on all that shit, even when I logically know that I HAVE to, so I often have a tendency to avoid it, instead, which can become unhealthy 
It doesn‚Äôt mean that Fi-Se/Se-Fi users can‚Äôt be emotionally complex and abstract in understanding and exploring their own feelings on paper, or through art, sport, and other activities when they are passionate about someone or something. They are often the most deep, emotionally complex, organically talented, and committed aesthetic  musicians, artists,  and personal experience-based writers and critics. Still, they are concrete creators, who live life one day at a time. They need the immediacy of personal emotional investment, personal gratification, personal connection, positive results, and/or practicality in the application of everything they set out to do. Otherwise,  they tend to struggle and feel bogged down by having to do things that they don‚Äôt like doing. They tend to hate learning impractical theory. 
ISFPs often tend to get bogged down by college because they aren‚Äôt being constantly spoon fed and motivated by their professors and advisors in college with academic support given to students by them, whether they ask for it or not, they aren‚Äôt being constantly reminded to do their work on time and keep their academic priorities straight, and because they actually have to tap into their uncomfortable Ni-tert and Te-inferior cognitive function zones that often make them feel insecure, incompetent, and largely powerless in regards to their own futures, so they can fall into avoidance mode and struggle to take initiative by putting up with courses that they are required to take to graduate, even if they don‚Äôt like them, planning ahead for their own future major/minor graduation requirements, internships, and career by finding the information needed to do those things out by themselves with no reminders of these obscure pieces of required information just told to you on the first day of classes by your professors and advisors outright because they are inferior Te logic users, especially in regards to doing things that feel like ‚Äúchores‚Äù that they NEED to do, rather than WANT to do. 
SFPs are often emotionally complex and wise children their whole lives. They are independent in the sense that they don‚Äôt like being bogged down with restrictions and rules that they don‚Äôt like, and they often have insightful and mature personal values and opinions about whatever practical subject or talent they happen to feel emotionally invested in and share a personal connection to. However, we also would rather not be adults, do work that we feel no personal emotional investment in, like dull and passionless drones, who work an eight hour job from Monday to Friday really well with no heart, just to pay the bills, and we want to always feel comfortable and leisurely doing whatever we love dancing through life (hey, a Wicked Song reference, but that song is very similar to how SFPs want to live their lives all the time, even though they ultimately never will be able to; they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbrainless,‚Äù their personal values and close relationships do matter to them, they are not all shallow, but life is much more ‚Äúpainless‚Äù for them whenever they can spontaneously do whatever it is they enjoy freely without being bogged down by fears of the future, or anything that feels like boring work and chores  for them)."
1745,isfp,"It just takes time.  ISFP tends to accumulate greater hands-on experience and that can poke a lot of holes in INTJ theorizing.  Logic requires no special skills, only keen observation.
INTJ still see things I don't, their input is valuable, but what seemed so superhuman at the start has been in part made clear to me.  And they have needed to be more emotionally cognizant, too, because the world demanded it of them.  That's how it ends up working."
1746,isfp,"Hey, just visiting these parts for this very reason, trying to get an idea of how my ISFP girlfriend thinks. I often wonder how much I intimidate her out of talking. It's like, on the one hand I know I can't expect to get into the most complex of topics with her, we simply won't share every interest ever. But on the other, I do want her to engage me more with whatever random curiosity she has. A different perspective is still useful even if we seem obstinate at first. I find that INTJs suffer a lack of self-aware emotional variance when considering a stance. That is, we think differently depending on our current emotional state, but we only ever account for our current mindset of the moment. So, it's useful if as an ISFP you can sort of draw out a different emotion from us, perhaps forcibly, just to make us consider a different perspective. "
1747,isfp,"Then why not present it as such? You can outline different perspectives to look at the topic at hand, your opinion, feelings or facts on them, while stating that you're undecided about your final judgement. We like perspectives, we just tend to have strong opinions on them.
I can't speak for others, but there's nothing more unengaging than a person that remains silent all the time, especially when they'd have something to offer/say."
1748,isfp,"I married an INTJ. I've had the same feeling, thoughts and questions you are asking. What I have settled on is that, I'm happiest being my true self and I appreciate my husband for being his true self. I watch, listen and try to understand what and who he is and who I am; I wouldn't try to be more 'intelligent' because it wouldn't be authentic. You don't have to debate with your INTJ to have a meaningful expression of communication. If you don't have a particular opinion on a subject just ask what their thoughts are, they like to go into depth about their passions. Sit back and listen, then ask more questions.  Asking questions shouldn't make you feel less of a person."
1749,isfp,"Eh, why is debating a virtue, and what‚Äôs so great about having strong opinions? You sound like you‚Äôve been criticised by someone you respect. I think the best thing about ISFPs is their open-mindedness, and the fact that I can totally be myself around them 24/7 ands it‚Äôs all totally OKAY. Don‚Äôt ever lose that, and don‚Äôt try to be like INTJ!"
1750,isfp,"Reading through conversations on here could explain why I, as a fellow isfp, am so inactive on social media. I don't have any updates on my FB, haven't changed my photo in 2 years or so, haven't updated Instagram in over a year. I have a secret fb profile where I go to hide and talk to my closest friends (lol). Part of the reason is I don't see whats the point of letting people know details about my life. Not sure how many of you share this tendency."
1751,isfp,"Never posted a Facebook status the whole time I've had it. I don't comment on much posts unless I think it's something worth commenting on. And I don't upload any photos besides my occasional profile-pic-updates. The most I do on Facebook is scroll down my feed for 5 or 10 minutes and like the things I find funny, but even then, I hardly do that. Facebook in my opinion has grown to just be a mess of clickbait and uneducated/ignorant drama. The main thing keeping me there is Facebook messenger which is my main form of communication with friends, and the fact that you can easily sign up to most things with a Facebook account.
I do like to update my Instagram once in a while. Usually just to add to my accounts' aesthetic appeal. Some accounts are interesting enough to keep me tethered to the Insta platform.
I like using Snapchat. It's easier for me to share random updates of what I'm doing there and it's a funner way to socialise with others. Watching my friends' different snapchat stories are great.
I don't have Twitter. I find it kind of pointless (for me) and it isn't that big where I live anyway."
1752,isfp,"I'm the same way. I just recently unfollowed everyone on Facebook except for a traveling page, so Facebook is essentially an address book with pretty pictures now. Sometimes I feel bad about not being so active on all the social media because it's pretty much what all my peers do. I just don't see the appeal. Whenever I do try to be better at that stuff I feel fake. "
1753,isfp,"I'm totally this way, I hate posting on FB because I feel people don't need to know all of that shit, but I go on Twitter and just have conversations with people, and try to keep my life out of others heads."
1754,isfp,"I have a FB account but don't use it.
I use WhatsApp for school things.
I reddit way too much.
I always have twitter open in my browser to make snarky replies to weird accounts like those ""Did you know?"" ones that post half-truths and sell them as fact."
1755,isfp,"I have 1 photo on facebook and never post statuses. I check it often because I use it to stay in touch with friends and family members. I started an instagram account the other day and really like it, I'll probably post to it regularly.
I have a twitter account too but don't use it "
1756,isfp,"Social media makes me pretty anxious and sad, so I'm not very active on it at all. I also feel like I'm just doing stuff for attention whenever I post things, and people would call me out on it.
Right now, I just use Facebook for extra-curricular related updates and such."
1757,isfp,"I'll try to make a joke or tell a funny story ever now and then.  Sometimes I'll share music or vidoes, but I've never been one to post   about what I'm doing or post pictures of myself/my group.  I have a few active groups of my closest friends on FB where we share music and stay connected with eachother.  "
1758,isfp,"I enjoy using Reddit and Instagram. I deleted my FB account. Too much drama. I prefer interacting with complete strangers than acquaintances. I never personally took FB that seriously. I always posted silly things, mostly to make people smile."
1759,isfp,"True about the fake thing. I think for me I don't have a public persona. I'm use to having 1 on 1 interactions with people. Having a post just announces your business to many people at once, it just feels not genuine to me. I also find it odd when I see statuses that are messages meant for specific people. Seems like showing off to me."
1760,isfp,I share the EXACT same sentiments about trying to keep my life out of other's heads. The thought that part of my day will show up in someone's news feeds just sort of gives me anxiety. Although I will say I don't feel the same way when I see people's life updates the way I think people will react to mine.
1761,isfp,"That EXACTLY how I feel. Whenever someone makes a post about a certain person and posts it through social media it bugs me so much because the whole time I'm just like why don't you just say it to the person directly? Why is any of this any of my business? Stuff like mothers/fathers day, birthdays of friends, or just posting about whoever they are dating...it makes no sense to me."
1762,isfp,"Hahaha I know right!? My friend(ISFJ)'s parents went on vacation recently and she she made a status with them tagged saying something like ""Have a safe trip Mom and Dad! I love you!"" I did an eye roll on the inside. I feel like these people think that having an audience makes their ""affection"" more authentic or something? It's all somewhat phony in my opinion."
1763,isfp,"It's just so weird! I had a friend get offended that I called her on her birthday instead of making an instagram post of pictures of us together and a lengthy novel about how much I value our friendship. I seriously thought she was joking at first, but she sadly wasn't. "
1764,isfp,That's amazing someone would actually be offended by that. Sounds like it's more important the world knows you value her than just her knowing. I would just be embarrassed than flattered if someone made such a post about me. I think many people would love that though.
1765,isfp,"Hello, I'm a male INFJ, and I've recently run into an ISFP, a beautiful lady. Simply put--and please correct me if I'm wrong--I think all ISFPs are living, breathing art. When I see or talk with this person, I am both fascinated, curious; I want to find out more about her and build a relationship with her. However, I don't really know how.
Could you please share your thoughts on what ISFPs enjoy, find important? This can be something collective and shared by all ISFPs, or just your personal opinion. Thank you already for reading this post, and please feel free to leave any (positive and negative) comments. Forewarning are always welcome as well. Have a wonderful day!"
1766,isfp,"It's really going to depend on personal interests. ISFPs are all about enjoying life, and living in accordance with their personal value system, so it can be difficult to narrow down specifics.
Me, I'm all about trying to find that balance between relaxation and living life to the fullest."
1767,isfp,"I'm an INFJ and I just started dating a guy who is an ISFP. When we first met and started hanging out we became friends pretty effortlessly (we were both looking for new friends anyway). He has been super sweet and it's refreshing how much he values experiences like talking a walk through nature or petting an awesome dog or listening to a good song. I mean, I enjoy these things too but he seems to strive for these experiences, whereas us INFJs have different things that motivate us. 
With that being said, I think you should find out what experiences she enjoys and try to do one of those things with her. Show you're interested by asking questions about it and asking to hang out with her in that context (""Do you want to go to that art gallery/park/book store you were talking about?""). And while you're with her don't get stuck in your head or try too hard, just be in the moment and enjoy yourself. Good luck! Sorry if I butted in, I know you weren't looking to talk to another INFJ but I've kinda been trying to get some insight into my BF (typical INFJ amirite) and this is just something I've been thinking about. Just had to share it, hah. "
1768,isfp,My guess would be that it all depends on our specific interest as far as what we enjoy. I can't speak for all ISFP for this me I am a pretty laid back person I like to just enjoy myself most of the time. 
1769,isfp,"I loved your comment regarding 'living breathing art'.
Do you have her online sn or phone number yet? Texting is good. Check on her every other day. Call her at night.
If she's an ISFP anything like me, she will appreciate straight forwardness. If you feel you have anything nice to say regarding what you think and feel about her, tell her straight up. Because we tend to be pretty emotional and appreciate praise like that.
We also don't like emotional games, like some people like to chase, push and pull, ISFPs hate that.
Just be real with her, kind, forward, if you can spend some time talking to her and if it goes well just go ahead and invite her out to a movie or an evening walk & talk."
1770,isfp,"It varies from person to person, really. Taking a shot in the dark here, but one of the best things you could do is get to know this girl by asking questions, just generally showing interest in the most polite and considerate way that you can (pls no cling).
One thing that is probably safe to say about the majority of ISFPs: we love to enjoy life and all the possibilities it has to offer when it comes to beauty. That said, we also enjoy peace and mutual respect. As long as you understand and can return that respect, you should get along well. Listen to your ISFP, and take note of their needs. If they take note of yours as well, even to the point of doing things with/for you, chances are you've done something right. We enjoy our personal space and will really only break it for those we consider worth having around."
1771,isfp,"I know, right?! Like I want to do everything, go exploring, go on adventures, etc...but at the same time I'm so lazy and just want to relax. So I end up daydreaming about fun things, planning them in my head, but rarely actually go do these things because I'm too busy relaxing.
I miss being a kid so much. There was so much more free time to relax and do fun things, instead of responsible adult things."
1772,isfp,"Haha, I'm still trying to figure that out myself. I guess one example is that I just got back from a four day vacation with my boyfriend, staying in a cozy cabin with a fireplace, and hiking in a state park. To a lesser extent, going to concerts, taking walks, listening to music, reading books, playing games. Sometimes it means hanging out with good friends. Sometimes it means staying in and taking a relaxing bath. Basically just enjoying whatever joys life has to offer. Which can be very interest based, so what that means can differ heavily from person to person.
My personal struggle is maintaining my relaxed natural state with work and everyday chores. Between all the things I HAVE to do to get by, I don't often feel like I have to time to do a lot of the aforementioned activities because I'm too stressed to actually enjoy them. Which usually results in me taking a lot of relaxing baths!"
1773,isfp,"I think I really going my ""personality"" 95 % of what I read by other ISFP's makes me go.. Yup, that's me.
After a half year of soul searching and trying to figure myself out I did the test and everything just fits.
Makes it so much easier to explain to others what and who I am.
And why I do things the way I do."
1774,isfp,"I am an ISFP, and was wondering if my dilemma was common for my type or not. I've literally never hit a rage, mode towards another person. I get mad, and when I am upset I usually lock myself away in my room, but I've never so much as yelled at someone else.
Which is I'm kind of asking because I live with an ESTJ, who gets under my skin, and I'm honestly scared that one of these days I'm going to go off on him, physically. I wouldn't last two seconds in a shouting match, he's got a very, forceful personality, so in a shouting match I wouldn't stand a chance, which means my only recourse it feels like is violence. 
It's not something I want. I don't ever want it to come to that, but he really, pushes me, and the fact that I haven't taken a swing at him despite dealing with his attitude for the past 5 years, makes me wonder if it's cowardice on my part not to.
Is this an ISFP in general thing?
(By the way I do know ESTJ's I'm friends with. This specific one is the issue.)"
1775,isfp,"I get enraged rarely. 
It barely gets to this point anymore but I would get to a point that at the end of a 15 minute period something will be damaged; knuckles, walls, childhood toys, drawers, chairs etc. I actually have four small scars on my knuckles from punching a wall on separate occasions. 
Currently my extreme anger manifests itself as a gnashing of teeth and a faux pulling of hair, heavy breathing and an immediate halt of any current activities. 
Sometimes at people, most of the time when I'm in my room thinking about those people. "
1776,isfp,"With' closest family member, yes I can yell.
With friend's and other's I only get cold silent angry-behavor even when I get really angry, and usally try to talk about it easy or move on. So the bad tension don't grow."
1777,isfp,"I get mad very rarely, at most getting visibly annoyed. Times when I really should be mad I usually end up locking myself in my room and crying. I've often thought that I feel sadness when other people would feel anger."
1778,isfp,"Shit, this is totally me. When I get 'mad' in an argument, often with my parents, I feel very frustrated and I start to cry. I've never felt like I was really going to break or punch something because I was too angry. I can yell when people are yelling at me, but never even close to how agressive other people can get."
1779,isfp,"I was a little violent but not dangerously so. Enough that my dad had to sit on me a few times to restrain me, but more often than not it would be screaming tantrums. Usually it was due to my mom yelling at me over things I viewed as trivial. So our fights would mainly be me calling her self-centered and impatient and her calling me disrespectful and selfish."

1781,isfp,"I used Coffee Meets Bagel about a year and a half ago and got a few matches, but I deleted the app after a week. It just seemed like more work than it was worth and I was really busy with school & work. The women I matched with were nice but I didn't really have a clue what to say. 
I'd like to get back on it since I have gotten in much better shape since then, but I don't have many recent pictures of myself and my phone's front camera is broken...so I might buy a new phone or I'll just try to meet people IRL. I'm a pretty passive and reserved guy though, so other than going to the gym and work, I don't do much, so a dating app is probably the best idea for me honestly. "
1782,isfp,"i always get stuck on this question when asked because i feel like i have no special/fun hobbies lol. but idk i like listening to music, playing the sims, taking care of my pet dog & rabbit, looking at home interior/exterior design and stuff cuz i think it's pretty. wish i could do more activities outside but have no one who really likes to do the same with me xD not sure if this counts but a lot of my time just goes towards thinking about stuff???? but ya really i'm just down for whatever"
1783,isfp,"Running, reading books, writing, video games, collecting shiny things, occasional coding, internet research on something I found interesting, being around a lot of trees, drawing, listening to music, singing, exploring, frequent naps, thrift shopping, putting together lots of outfits involving mom jeans
I honestly cannot sit still."
1784,isfp,"not sure what you mean as the ones i listed are things i tend to do a lot but i guess there are some more things i could add. i hang out with friends, scope out new places to eat, do whatever activities people invite me out to do (soccer, hiking, etc.) which i enjoy, taking photos though not professionally or anything, use social media quite a lot. i don't really have any particular or organized hobbies. "
1785,isfp,"It's pretty much life lessons, or I try to capture what I'm feeling/seeing at any moment in time. I can't do it with my voice, and it's a lot easier to write it out. I also like writing short stories where the characters are dealing with the physical manifestations of dealing with the demons in their own minds..."
1786,isfp,"I've been on a huge spirituality kick. Here's what's in my library right now.
The entire Conversations with God series
Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
The Four Agreements and Mastery of Love by Don Miguel Ruiz
I'm currently in the middle of Stephen King's It, Maxwell Maltz's Psycho-Cybernetics, and Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere and I just got Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray the other day because the Barnes and Noble made cover looked cool, but I don't want to start it until I finish one of the others.
I'd like to get more into science fiction and american history books"
1787,isfp,"I love sci-fi and fantasy books. Murakami's got some great stuff, and I'm guilty of enjoying Stephen King (The Stand is very good).
Others worth your time are Snow Flower and the Secret Fan and A Tale For The Time Being.
ALSO I'm really into comics and graphic novels. Saga is such a good series. I've also been liking Ms. Marvel. If you're into the more visceral stuff, the manga version of Battle Royale is amazing. (But major warning: it's super graphic. Not kidding. Take your personal idea of ""graphic"" and multiply it x1000.)
Writing? I like world-building and have a collection of OCs that I like to flesh out and write backstories for. These days, though, poetry has been my go-to."
1788,isfp,"shit i dont even remember. i started playing when i was 12, im 25 now. 
i haven't played much in the past 3 years so my calluses are gone, but at one point they were thick enough that i could tear a chunk of my finger tip off with my teeth and wouldn't feel it. I guess if i decide to pick it back up I'll find out how long it takes."
1789,isfp,"This interest literally started a few months ago. I used to hate reading because I only did it in school when it was required of me.
Once you find what you're into you'll find yourself reading all the time! Audiobooks really make a difference too. I drive a lot, and hate driving, so it makes the time pass and an otherwise unpleasant task for me enjoyable."
1790,isfp,"I've taken the test multiple times and check out as ISFP! I mean I'll probably take it again now. I feel like my personality is very hot and cold and has changed over time.
Also, looked up Station Eleven. It had me at ""fictional swine flu epidemic."" Thank you! Def on my to-read list"
1791,isfp,"For a while I mistyped as INFP, and I was wondering if this is a common thing. I've heard that ISFPs are some of the least obviously sensing S types. Plus, if the inferior Ni is well developed, it can lead to a lot of Ne-seeming actions. I know the main reason I mistyped as INFP was because I saw the ""mental disorganisedness"" that is frequently attributed to Ne, until I looked into the tertiary Ni vs Si trait. 
Not to mention I like a lot of philosophy, but even then I prefer it when some sort of final conclusion is reached, rather than just brain-spitting a bunch of possibilities. I see that as Ni rather than Ne, but as you may have noticed by now I'm not really an expert on functions, lol. 
So yeah: the title is really the main thing. If you have, then how and why do you think you mistyped?"
1792,isfp,"I tested as INFP up until I was about 21. I thought my ""head in the clouds"" nature, love of school, and my tendency to be ""out of touch"" with my surroundings meant I was an intuitive. 
Then I met a real INFP and understood the difference.  "
1793,isfp,"I usually get infp but compared to my extremely infp sister i am quite clearly isfp. Its hard to explain i guess but i can just tell that im more of an isfp. I think isfp can often identify with infp descriptions because the true differences are deeper and more complicated than ""infps like philosophy and are imaginative emotional artists"" etc etc.a lot of the surface level infp traits are very relatable to isfps too."
1794,isfp,"I don't know either. I've thought I was INTP, INFP, and ISFP so far. Also ENFP and ENTP if you count that, but that was way back when all I did was the 16p test rather than self-typing, which isn't very reliable. I'd get professionally typed, but I don't want to waste my money on that, lol."
1795,isfp,"I know EXACTLY what you're talking about, except I am am INFP.
I wondered if I might have been ISFP for a while until I made a friend do one of the tests, he scored INFP, but I knew there was no way in hell he was the same personality type as me considering how different we were. So I thought about it and it made sense that he was ISFP and I was INFP, he had the Se attributes of being impulsive, not being the most patient, etc. (not to say any of this is bad, I love you ISFPs)
Meanwhile I was a lot more careful, less durable, etc. But at the same time I thought it was really weird with how we got along despite being different, and now it makes sense that we both had Fi, and to some extent were looking at life through a similar looking glass.
To be honest having 100% certainty of my type was one of the best feelings I have had in regards to MBTI."
1796,isfp,"Yeah, that was my thinking too. If you go by most overall type descriptions, the two seem to be the same thing but worded differently. I guess the real thing for me was that the tertiary Ni description seemed to explain my ""N-ness,"" for lack of a better word, better than auxiliary Ne did. Not to mention that I've always had pretty high Se, but I used to just disregard that as a fluke."
1797,isfp,"Are there any things you do or recognize and attribute to your type? 
I think it could be fun if we shared some of our ‚Äòjust ISFP things‚Äô and maybe we can see how closely we relate to each other‚Äôs experiences."
1798,isfp,"So I don't know about others but...I tend to wander. If I'm with friends I tend to find myself detached and off on my own adventure.
Sometimes I don't realize I've wandered off until I look around. 
But I always find my way back to my people. 
But this could be even on my own. I'll go out and float around and see what happens "
1799,isfp,"I‚Äôll start!
When you‚Äôre in a museum and your considering considering the ethical implications of having artifacts that are only there as a result of an abusive colonial relationship and you find yourself dragging your fingertips across the glass cases and stanchions wishing you could touch these unethically displayed items. #justISFPthings
(I‚Äôm assuming this relates to our Fi and Se functions. I feel bad that there is still such global inequality as a result of colonialism and that it‚Äôs normalized by having things that were stolen from a nation that was terrorized by colonial powers displayed for public speculation without drawing attention to the implications it has, but also I really wanna touch all the stuff.)"
1800,isfp,I do this too! I like having my own little unique side-quests/adventures. I feel like I get the most authentic experience on my own when I‚Äôm not tuning into the chatter of my friends or following the group‚Äôs agenda. It‚Äôs nice to carve out slivers of solo time when out and about with others.

1802,isfp,"I'm curious what everyone's experience with drugs are like. Like what goes on in your head. Stuff like weed,alcohol...acid???
So i've tried acid twice. Both times it wasn't bad, but it wasn't pleasant. It could just be my environment, but it was around good friends.
My friend who is an INTP, says she enjoys acid trips because it helps her think. I guess it makes sense. What's everyone elses experience?"
1803,isfp,"I enjoy psychedelics. I've done LSD a handful of times, mushrooms dozens of times, and weed (frequent use for 20+ years). They are definitely the way to go for me as I don't really enjoy drinking as much. That said, I'm a total lightweight now and don't really indulge (except for weed, maybe a couple of times a month). "
1804,isfp,"I get paranoid and socially awkward on weed, though it may be because I haven't tried it more than a few times. 
And with alcohol it's almost the opposite, I then enjoy everyone's company, especially with strangers.
Though I do really prefer being sober because I like being in control. Not waking up the morning after and trying to piece together the evening. And being anxious that I said or did something stupid."
1805,isfp,"Isfp and istp is basically the types that can handle any drug you take so have fun.
Ive taken LSD, Shrooms, benzos, DMT, alot of different strenghts of opiates, mdma, coke, amfetamines, ketamine and lotsa other stuff. They are all there for us humans to experience and damn it was all fun and enlightening! Helps with art aswell, if you are planning on tweaking up your ""weird"" level a little."
1806,isfp,"Diphenhydramine: At low doses (25 mg or less), it puts me into an almost trancelike state. I feel like everything is a little slower than usual and I notice patterns more easily. It also makes music sound better than usual and helps me forget about the bad things I've been through. 50 mg knocks me out and I almost stopped breathing the one time I tried 75 mg. Really, I only use diphenhydramine when I can't get to sleep, if I have an upset stomach, or if my allergies are absolutely horrible. I'm glad I never went above 75 mg, though; it sounds like people start seeing spiders and talking to dead people after the 100 mg mark.  "
1807,isfp,"isfp here. I think I like every drug except for ketamine. I don't like being stuck in k hole because it's so boring. 
I'm a web/graphic designer and when I take LSD/Shrooms while drawing, it's effing amazing. The sensation of drawing every line is a sensation overload lol."
1808,isfp,"Alcohol usually ends up embarrassing me. I think ISFPs tend to synergize better with more mellow/internal drugs (weed, shrooms, acid). I spend enough time in my head that those drugs just come very naturally."
1809,isfp,"Alc- love it. Turns me into an extrovert, or at least lets me stop analyzing everything and I just spit words out exactly how I'm thinking. It's such an adrenaline rush. I love it
weed- been smoking about a year now at least once a day. Sometimes I can go into a trip if I smoke. I need to slow down with it. I don't like to be around others when I smoke cause I get more introverted and introspective and my mind kicks into overdrive and I get even more quiet. 
Lsd- done it about twice, took one hit and had a bad trip(I was hanging with somebody I never hung out with before) and another time I did half a hit but didn't feel anything. I wanna take like 5 hits by myself and see some trippy shit!
Idk where dabs fall into, but I did it once and I was so out of it lmfao and I think I had acid the same night so I did acid three times but I don't remember much from the night except waiting for it to all be over
Edit: I'm not sure if I'm INFP/ISFP"
1810,isfp,"I'm beginning to find that weed makes my mind race even faster than it's norm, so I've been taking it easy on marijuana as of late.  I've tried a little meditation, but I can't ever seem to focus for longer than about 15 minutes.  Have any tips?"
1811,isfp,"Oh yeah, one more tip. idk if its isfp related but shitty mdma really fucks with your Se. Id reccomend instead of mdma for clubbing and sorts just drag a good line of amfetmines, for me atleast it has mdma-like effects."
1812,isfp,"I always try to start routines, and I‚Äôll keep them up for a couple days, but then I fail  :(. Ideally I would like to go to bed at about 10:30 since I need to wake up at 5:30,  but it‚Äôs currently 12:03 AM here and I just finished a major assignment that was due at midnight, which I‚Äôd forgotten about until about 10:45. This is a common occurrence and it‚Äôs EXTREMELY rare that I go to bed before 11:45. Night time is rushy time lol."
1813,isfp,I feel like this is something I don't share in common with a lot of other ISFP personality types I talk to. I can fall asleep with just a moments notice and sleep like a log. I have never struggled to fall asleep. As far as my routine is concerned. I lay myself down an hour or two earlier than I need to so I can have conversations with myself for a few hours before drifting off naturally. Socks on off/boxers on off/fully dressed/butt naked I couldnt give a fuck about any of that. It depends on my mood when I get there. On my back/on my side/cuddling my pillow that depends on where my conversations take me.
1814,isfp,"Man oh man. Can of worms is what this is.
‚Äã
I've been trying to find the right way to fall asleep for years.  For me, I need to not drink coffee after 12pm. Regular exercise.  Limit alcohol.  Read a god damn book and put my fucking phone/laptop away.  Drink a bed time tea (holy shit how did this happen, I'm old as hell now).  Take some melatonin if I'm not tired and need to get to bed so I'm not a fucking zombie the next day.  
If I do need something to watch to unwind I've been watching that 80-something year old grandma play Skyrim (Shirley Curry).  It's my safe place and is very comforting for some reason.  Helps me sleep if my mind is still racing or I'm overly anxious at bed time.
These are a few of the things that have helped me.  Which sucks because it requires a lot of work and it took time to get to this point.  All that said, I still have shitty nights of sleep and all sorts of stuff like that because I love staying up late.  That doesn't work well with an 8-5 big boy job though."

1817,isfp,"Hello my fellow ISFP comrades, I want y'all's thoughts/opinion/advice on how you feel when you deal with one person for a long time.
I am good at one on one conversation, when being social. With that being said, when I think about spending allot of time alone or being stuck with a person for an extended period of time, I get a bad gut feeling. I just don't think I would be as fun or lively as I am in public.  I also believe it has to do with something about planning for the future. But idk, y'all take a shot at it"
1818,isfp,"I'm actually at my most comfortable in those situations. With my wife, I can let all my guards down and just be myself. There are a hand full of other people I'm that comfortable with too, but I don't see them nearly as often. One on one with people I barely know (interviews, ugh) is pretty much the worst, for the first few minutes, and leading up to the interaction."
1819,isfp,"Soooo glad I am not alone on this one! Most introverts I know say they prefer one-on-one time to being in a group, but I MUCH prefer the latter, as I feel like I can contribute to the conversation at my leisure, and I don't have to be the other persons' sole focus. One on one can get awkward for me because I feel so much pressure to keep the conversation going."
1820,isfp,"I'm an experienced public speaker, so I have absolutely no problem socializing with groups of people. With that said, I still prefer one on one settings [with people I'm close to], because I don't feel like I need to ""compete"" for attention. One on one interactions with strangers can indeed become quite uncomfortable if they're too eager for conversation. Perhaps you feel more comfortable in a crowd because you can choose to socialize or blend in and observe when you want. "
1821,isfp,"I once had a thing with an INTP girl. Her Ti grated on me and she was horribly scatterbrained. This, on top of her reluctance to ever express her desires and concerns when necessary. She may have had Asperger Syndrome. She was very feisty behind closed doors, though, and she was very pretty. If she weren't a headcase I'd miss her more."
1822,isfp,"I'm currently in a relationship with an INFP, we started as friends first for a very long time, most of the time all is awesome. Not all INFP are the same but they are similar, the one I'm with is beautiful, really smart, problem solver, and loves games. The only thing that wears me out at times is the INFP's high anxiety, often times I will stay up late at night/early morning to help my partner to get through it's bouts of anxiety, other than the INFP's crazy anxiety levels all is great!"
1823,isfp,"Not sure what my past SOs have been, but my current boyfriend of two years is an INTP. Pros are that we never fight at all, we balance our couple time and our individual time fairly well, and we are both very honest, responsible, and affectionate. Only cons I can think of are that it isn't a very spontaneous and exciting relationship (which tbh I don't really mind), and that we aren't usually on the same page in conversation. He's like an encyclopedia, and I'm like a picture book that loses track of any semblance of a plot halfway through."
1824,isfp,"ENFP! Started off as best friends since high school then after I broke up with my boyfriend, he finally decided to make a move. It worked out and I have a lot of fun with him! Always new adventures and I learn new things. 
A con is sometimes he can get very clingy and irritatingly chatty. I just need to train him when to back off."
1825,isfp,"My past SO was an ISFJ. He got a little too emotional and tried to hard to be assertive and spontaneous like my extroverted friends. Then again, when he didn't, things got boring fast. He liked to plan little imaginative dates without me MONTHS ahead which I found creepy instead of sweet (unlike me, i'd rather plan a week ahead). Why? Because he would plan them with my friends without me knowing then go ""She and I will go on a romantic walk and a fancy dinner...etc. (in detail)"" then they would go ""Awww"" and here I was getting embarrassed about it as I overhear. I feel like things like that should be kept personal and not a conversation show with my friends. Oh and I also found myself emotionally dominant in the relationship but I actually liked that part...heh. 
After looking through the rest of the comments, I guess I jumped aboard the INTJ train. :) He has fun ideas and gives really good tips for my artistic skills because he thinks a lot more logically. Coolest guy I know and I love feeling so proud of him from all his big accomplishments so I end up treating him with a lot of baked goods. "
1826,isfp,"Dating an ENTJ, wahoo type opposites.  
We have our issues, and I think being opposites made us have to mature a lot.  Pros are that I get to be the only woobie in the relationship and his crazy ambitiousness rubs off on me.  Cons are that he sucks at figuring out my feelings and he has a hard time with me being unpredictable.  I've learned to try to be more clear/logical when I'm upset and he's learned how to come off as less of a jerk.  I really love him and I think our relationship has a sort of yinyang aspect to it due to out opposite-ness.
Also had an INFP courted me for awhile and it was kind of awful.  I think they make great friends since there's such a great connection.  But I personally can't handle someone who is just as sensitive as me.  It makes more really dramatic arguments about things that don't matter."
1827,isfp,"I'm with an ENFP/J. We instantly clicked when we met each other in high school. I remember telling my mom that night that I met someone who actually had the same sense of humor as me, I was SO excited. We hung out the next day. It took me a little bit to warm up to him, being an introvert and very careful about who I open up to. He was kind of pushy and really excited about our potential relationship though, which I found adorable. 
Pros are:


He's always excited to do anything I want to do, which is great since ISFPs love to experience, and he likes to do the same. 


Despite our misunderstandings, he's always willing to learn how an ISFP works so he can better take care of me. I've never met anyone who wanted to do that for me.


He knows how to be independent when he's away from me which is super hot.


He's my best friend. I can tell him anything without ever feeling judged. One of his gifts is unconditional love, and he never hides it or plays games with me to confuse me (something an INFP used to do with me. Although it's kind of fun and exciting to not know what they're thinking, it's such a relief to be with someone who is straightforward and reliable with their emotions.)


Jesus, I could go on about the pros.
Cons:


He can be a bit clingy at times, but after two years I think he understands my need for space, while at the same time always needing love.


He doesn't understand why I don't want to be lovey-dovey when I'm in a grumpy mood. Sometimes I just want to be serious as ISFPs have a tendency to be, and he doesn't have those moments. Even when he's grumpy he wants to be hugged and loved. But I want to be left alone in my negativity and if anyone tries to make that a joke I get angrier. We're working on that one :)


For both of us being P's, we're pretty good at acting like J's when we need to."
1828,isfp,"I dated an ENTP guy for five years. It was a fun time. I mean, the sex was pretty much non-existent, but that's another story. I liked that he could make any situation fun. Example: driving for 5 hours, and we looked up all the tiny towns we passed to see the population, etc. We had pretty similar senses of humor, so that was nice. I liked that I could ask him pretty much any question and he'd have an answer for me. (Not necessarily a true answer, but still.) Like my personal Wikipedia. Of course, he bs'ed a lot, but I liked the fact that I could call him on his bull and he seemed to get off on that shit. 
Cons: He seriously seemed to lack a moral code sometimes. 
It didn't work out, but for a reason neither of us had any control over. Personality-wise, I think we were pretty well matched. Now I just need to find an ENTP woman..."
1829,isfp,"My husband is also an INTJ, and our relationship is similar to yours. He so frequently has to make Plans, and Plans for the The Plan goes Wrong. And then I kind of waltz in and 'accidentally' set fire to the Plans and we roll with whatever. He keeps me organized, I keep him spontaneous. It works, weirdly.
I do want to smack him, sometimes, for the judging that he can't help but do. I try to get him to see the bigger picture: that person might not be pretending to be homeless, maybe they actually are and haven't eaten in a week; that mother has probably been dealing with her crying, whining toddler for an hour and finally snapped; etc."
1830,isfp,"I won't lie and say it was easy, it took a long time for her to commit to a relationship, around 1-2 years. I don't know if all INFP have troubles committing to things but my partner does and sometimes I do as well. It was strange because as soon as I stopped pursuing so much and just relaxed about being with her, the INFP started to acknowledge her feelings about me. It was a little surprising at the time I remember thinking, ""I tried everything and this was the only thing I had to do?"". 
On a side note, if you have ever heard of the eneagram (I think I posted about it once here) I can tell you that it is common for type four personality to be dominant in an INFP (though not all INFP's are 4's). They have an interesting thought process, I have a book on it and it says "" they are attracted to what's missing; the distant, unavailable, and hard to get."". Now I didn't become disinterested with her or ignore her, I just put it into my mind that maybe she wasn't ready for me and thought I might look for another, but I still hung out with her and did a lot of things with her. Type 4s also have abandonment issues, so as soon as she knew I wasn't going to disappear from her life, it seems she became available for me. 
Good luck dude and I hope my story helps you!"
1831,isfp,"My best friend is an INTJ, and honestly, it's the best friendship ever. I'm constantly amazed by how thoughtful she is (and prepared for everything! How does she think of everything?! Seriously!) She's also pretty damn hilarious. If we were attracted to each other I'd date the hell out of her. "
1832,isfp,"Hey, I've been trying to become friends with an isfp girl recently, and I've been having trouble. Everytime I bring up something hoping to continue the conversation, she responds with really short answers, and the convo stops. I'm an infp girl. Am I doing something wrong?"
1833,isfp,"You are trying to force the convo. If that makes sense. I also do this sometimes. Just give it time. Im speaking for myself here: I do that aswell, I usually take a little while to warm up to people and then I can talk easily. And sometimes I just dont want to talk to people so then the convo just dies, and its not just people I dont feel comfortable with but everyone. 
So just give it time, hang out, maybe try do an activity with her. "
1834,isfp,"One very important tip that I learnt. Never speak over an ISFP!  It seems to be their number one pet peeve! Listen attentively, and always wait for them to finish. They will appreciate it, and will be encouraged to talk more!"

1836,isfp,"Not me personally. Even though I don't organise my things that well or put them in places that are easy to remember, I still remember where they are anyway. I don't think it has to do with ISFP, I would have thought more extroverted personalities forgot things more often anyway."
1837,isfp,"I assumed it would be isfp related because we tend to seek excitement and novelty. For me, that means dropping everything (causing me to lose my stuff) to explore interesting ideas, places, or people. "
1838,isfp,"Yeah we do tend to drop things and seek excitement but for some reason that doesn't happen to me. I remember everything, wherever it is. I haven't lost anything for a long time, but I suppose even with the personality type everyone is different. "
1839,isfp,Same! My feet get really callused from it. I love being barefoot so I don't mind it at all. The reason I'm always losing my shoes is because I take them off whenever (and wherever) opportunity strikes.
1840,isfp,"So, I initially mistyped myself and thought I might be INFP, until I went over to the INFP reddit. After a day or two I realized I wasn‚Äôt like these other people and did more research to discover I was definitely an ISFP. 
However, they have a huge community over there, and a well organized forum. What does that say about us? Is it indicative of our personality type that we haven‚Äôt formed a more robust and well defined community?
Or is it simply that intuitives are only 25% of the population and an online forum is a great rallying point, particularly for the kinds of folks that INFPs are. "
1841,isfp,"Since I'm willing to bet some of you might have some wink how about it? I know my music taste can be pretty different from most peoples (don't mean to brag lol), most of the music I listen to is alternative house, more specifically house arranges from game music. (If someone were to go through my playlist, this kind of music will be likely to show up often.) 
'Nyways let me see what you guys have. If you feel vulnerable exposing your music though, then I'm not pushing you."
1842,isfp,"I have 5 moods; Any jazz (other than smooth or freeform jazz), electro swing, funk/disco, video game music (particularly the soundtracks of Red Alert 2 and Bastion), and occasionally some other weeby non-vg related chiptunes/edm.
My Spotify Daily Mixes are a good snapshot of the kinds of things I listen to."
1843,isfp,"Bj√∂rk, TR/ST, The Knife, Grimes, Kate Bush, MF DOOM and all of his pseudonyms, Travis Scott, Death Grips, Black Flag, Tame Impala, Vampire Weekend, Alvvays, Jaloo, and lots of Vaporwave like Blank Banshee, Luxury Elite, Esprit, and such 
Other genres I'm fond of are City Pop, chiptune, samba, Latin Pop, and film soundtracks"
1844,isfp,"I tend to not really listen to music until I find a connection with the artist, or it's unique enough to pique my interest. Hence not much top 40 unless I get in a Lyft or Uber and something tricks me into liking it lol. All that said, I have 3 top artists that have lyrics, I actually pay attention to, and then it bleeds out from there to associated acts and bizarre musicals. In no particular order they're Tom Waits, Butch Walker, and Man Man. God damn, if you've never heard of any of them, do yourself a favor and enter their isfp worlds, utterly beautiful. As for just good old weird shit Mr. Bungle or any Mike Patton as well as anything Wes Borland touches as a side project. Sorry for the ramble, it's time for bed."
1845,isfp,"I don't know if any of this will fit in with what you are asking... 
Outside of Indie Folk and other popular music in that area like The Head and the Heart, I listen to Dream Theater and Liquid Tension Experiment (by far my go to music after the typical, helps keep me awake on long road trips). I also LOVE Micheal Jackson and then Oldies like 50's and 60's stuff. "
1846,isfp,"Fight the Feeling - Stick Figure.
I‚Äôm a big pacific reggae fan. Anyone lookin for new tunes- Stick Figure, Slightly Stoopid, iration, the movement, mishka, Iya Terra. Good music is everywhere, just gotta find it 
Also-
Blackbird - Fat Freddie‚Äôs Drop 
OP check out Cola (club mix). Also check out mixes by jauz, Eptic and ‚ÄúHabstrakt- Diplo and Friends mix‚Äù. Tell me whatcha think "
1847,isfp,"I listen to a pretty wide range of music, from modern hip-hop, to alternative/folk, to classic rock and pop.
Some of my favs off the top of my head are The Seige, Fleet Foxes, Trippie Redd, Cat Stevens, Travis Scott, Kanye West, Run the Jewels, Lorde,  Hozier, Gucci Mane, Lil Pump, Chvrches, Broods and Simon & Garfunkel"
1848,isfp,"I write chiptune/8-bit music which is generally kinda unconventional I guess as its own thing.
In the same vein as your house remixes from games, I enjoy the Mega Man Nonstop Remixes that were done a few years ago.
Oh, and Crash Twinsanity's OST is pretty neat too."
1849,isfp,"Currently jamming to Lonnie Smith and the Cosmic Echoes- Visions of a New World album.
Anything kinda bouncy/funky, like Kaytranada or Pomo remixes. Whoever produces Kendrick's albums too I owe much thanks.
On another note, I like really twangy indie and folk, like Caitlyn Smith and the Hillbilly Thomists."
1850,isfp,"I especially love long progressive songs, from bands like Dream Theater and Pink Floyd. Also I've gotten a little into N«Ωn√∏ƒâ√øbb≈írƒü Vb√´≈ô≈ôƒ¶≈çl√∂k√§√§vs≈¶, a really weird ambient thing, but not enough that I'd really call it part of my music taste.
I also make a pretty unique genre of music, but that's more out of necessity than anything else, lol. I'm not really into electronic music, but the only way I have at the moment to make music is an app for making electronic music (basically lets you make midi files but more user friendly). The result is very non-electronic musicish electronic music."
1851,isfp,"I like to find an artist or song from any genre bc I don't want to limit myself just to one type of music. I believe that you can find a song in each genre and in different languages if you look hard enough. 
I've had language exclusive time periods. I've done spanish, french, german, korean, Japanese,  russian, and Chinese.  Eurovision has helped find new artists through youtube.  I haven't been able to get fully into noise music tho.  
Where do you like to find new music? MySpace opened up a lot of music to me before going to last fm and now I'm on spotify. Never left youtube it's not as region blocked as spotify.
Edit: I only know english."
1852,isfp,"Bands / musicians I enjoy regularly - Kaleo, ed sheeran, hozier, of monsters and men, the lumineers, Ben Howard, hang of youths, James Bay, Kodaline, Lewis Watson, Sam smith, Vance joy.
Gotta be in the mood for but really enjoy- my dads music - Aussie rock, pop songs from the 50's/ 60's, 80's 90's. "
1853,isfp,"Yeah, a bunch of those for me too: 
The Knife, Grimes, Kate Bush, Hot Chip, Cut Copy, Beach House, Deerhoof, Bjork, Beck, Bowie, Eno, Velvet Underground, Vampire Weekend, John Zorn, OMD, Spiritualized, M83, The Congos, Lee Scratch Perry, Stan Getz, Caetano Veloso, Blonde Redhead, France Gall, Mecano, ..."

1855,isfp,"His ways of songwriting look a lot like Se-Ni. He focuses on SOUNDS and the melody of the association or repetition of words themselves to tell meaningful stories and to communicate as accurately as possible the depth of his feelings. I'd define his songs as concrete events painted in different colors in order to convey the powerful and vivid feelings and impressions he gets from such stories. Even his nostalgia does not seem like Si to me, he reflects on past memories to live all the sensations again and to understand them in his present situation rather than also needing to express missing it like an old home as would do Si users. He also usually does not sing about change and renewal (Ne) but rather about painful acceptance which seems like Fi Ni thinking about whether of not to move on with Se aux.
Se is also about many sensations and the sensations of other people, not about a linear, precise and detailed personal event like Si, which again goes well with his approach. I think he tells about a lot of concrete details that are not orderly but the meanings of his songs are linear and follow a personal road to get to a conclusion. Which again feels a lot more like a Ni approach than a Ne one.
One of his most famous quote is very much that of an ISFP in my opinion:
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre happy, you enjoy the music but when you‚Äôre sad, you understand the lyrics.‚Äù
But also
""When I'm trying to make a song ... I'm trying to make a photograph out of something you can never see.""
""My aim is to make something that represents where I am at that time."""
1856,isfp,"So they might not have the best career or be revolutionary geniuses but there's more to life than that, they can have absolutely satisfying relationships, families, hobbies and interests and live very happy and fulfilling lives while other types might be more anxious and really not at peace with themselves "
1857,isfp,"What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?
I've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp
Also I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)"
1858,isfp,"I enjoy small talk in professional settings. As an ISFP I find getting too close to people that I don't intend to have a close personal relationship with (teachers, boss, landlord) can become an issue or cause awkwardness or tension that wasn't necessary. This was a hard lesson to learn. However, if it's someone I find acceptable to have a closer bond with, I could sit and talk for hours or be slightly obsessive with communication (in a non creepy way) wanting to peel back the layers and find out what we have in common and if we truly click. But it has to be mutual."
1859,isfp,"I'm not adverse to friendly small talk from strangers, though I never initiate it. It can be nice. Even though nothing important is exchanged, at least we had a momentary connection and I know the other person is nice and human. 
If it's from someone I know, it falls into two categories: people I'm close with and people I'm not.
For people I'm close with, I think it's kind of useless. I only really have a couple friends who will make small talk with me. It's always ""So how was your weekend?"" ""How was your day?"" They don't mean to small talk. They genuinely want to know and start a conversation with me. And theoretically, it can be a deep question. Except I can't think of anything else to say besides ""good"", I ask them back, they respond with something similar, and it ends there. I feel like it creates an unnecessary wall of distant politeness. They start building it with their ""small talkish"" question, I feel too awkward to break it down so I continue building it with my ""small talkish"" answer. We could be talking about other things.
As for people I'm not close with, it usually happens when they try to start a conversation with me because I look lonely, loner that I am. This always makes me feel somewhat awkward, though. I appreciate that they're trying to include me and make me less alone, but I usually don't want to talk to them. "
1860,isfp,"First off, I like how you compared small talk to the annoying adverts at the start of youtube videos - I had never thought of it like that!
Secondly, I find small talk really annoying and draining. The only exception is if I'm trying to talk to someone even quieter than myself and so then I start the small talk in order to get some sort of conversation going or at least break the ice."
1861,isfp,"Honestly, I hate it. I will tolerate it and even initiate it in professional settings to establish a good mood or to feel someone out. However, if I'm outside of work, I really just want to be left alone if there's nothing useful or interesting to say or hear about. "
1862,isfp,"When my classmates do it it confuses me, when my teachers do it it contains some info that I need from them or am interested in so it's necessary. Since I don't have any friends in my class and up untill last summer I used to read a lot, I kept to myself. Now that I'm in a readers-block and my classmates talk to me I find it strange, like, ""What is this, what do you want, how do I react?"" and then I try to imitate what I think a ""normal"" person would say. It's confusion mixed with ""let's get this over with""."
1863,isfp,"Hi! I'm a 20 y/o ISFP, and I really need some advice with socializing.
For context, I had a rough childhood (bullying and such) and that made me distrustful of other people. 
Years later I went to a therapyst and I recovered from that. I changed high school and met new people, practising what my therapyst told me. It went nice and I even met my actual bf, but besides that, nothing was authentic to me.
Then my first year of college. It was superamazing. I've met people like me, genuine, lovely, caring and with same interests as me. But I chose wrong my major and had to change unis.
Now it's starting my 2nd year in this new uni. I haven't fit in yet... I feel like I'm revisiting my old me. I feel so bad that I left my true friends, and now I can't connect with anybody, they seem so alien to me.
So I'm trying to get some advice from ISFPs like me, maybe you've got experiences to share and lessons you've learned.
In any case, thank you for your attention :)"
1864,isfp,"I have been where you are, so that‚Äôs why I understand so well. I think the more we learn to let go of how we ‚Äúshould‚Äù act to fit in and gradually learn to be ourselves, it makes us more original. Everyone is weird; some try to cover it up more than others. The more we let go of who we want to be and act more like the people we REALLY are, we will acquire more ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends. There may not be many, but the people that do happen to come into your life at the most coincidental times- the ones that you just ‚Äòclick‚Äô with in originality or ‚Äúweirdness‚Äù‚Äî those are the people to stick with. 
They come and go, but us ISFPs are adventurers. People come into our lives to teach us lessons or to help us in our intuitive direction, but altogether, we learn to take that in either a positive or a negative way when they do end up leaving (which they probably will; everything is temporary, and that‚Äôs perfectly fine)."
1865,isfp,"While I'm still nervous about these people, I think I've accepted myself a bit as you said the past days.
Maybe in group projects I'll be left behind but my personal projects are still there... So I'll just don't care so much.
People come and go... My next 3 years will pass very fast.
Thank you for your thoughts :)"
1866,isfp,"In class, really. The environment was more ""engineery"", since I was doing programming and such.
Now I changed to an art school and people are more bubbly and dramatic. I just want peace, and it's exhausting to be around these people. 
So I want some tips to fit in without losing the sense of myself. All I see around internet is faking everything I do... There has to be a way."
1867,isfp,"I don't know if this is a type-specific thing but does anyone edit their posts a lot? Typos bug the hell outta me and there always seems to be something missing when I hit post, like for every idea there's three more details I wanna add. Or being overly cautious of the tone and worried it would be conveyed differently. When I'm texting with friends it's not a big deal and I'm more likely to use ""u"" and ""ur"" instead of you and your, but on more discussion based places like Reddit I'm terrified of coming across as illiterate. "
1868,isfp,"~~I don't really I'm not really afraid of coming across illiterate unless I'm saying something important really important,~~ 
Actually yes I do try to make sure I sound literate unless I'm just making a joke and I won't include a ~~type~~ typo unless it's intentional or adds some effect. But yes I do edit my posts ~~like so much~~ a lot, I worry about my tone and whether I'm explaining it just right and coming off the way ~~i~~ I want to. And it's just very hard to put ideas and feelings into words sometimes and I don't want to get it wrong. I also might think of how something I said could be interpreted differently and want to prevent that, ~~or I just think of a bunch of other nuances~~ and I'll think of more details I want to add, places I should be more specific/less specific, etc.
You get the idea.
Edit: apparently you can't do a strikethrough within a strikethrough, lol"
1869,isfp,"I do this too! !! I think it must be annoying how repetitive and redundant I am when I talk, but I always think maybe I didn't get the message through the first time XD
Edit: I just deleted the word ""maybe"", then retyped it without changing anything. "
1870,isfp,"Small preface: Primarily just a browser and I identify as ISFP but I really have to thank this sub- it's contents and users for giving me confidence/comfort in what I have/am experiencing and feeling - overall, being relatable. Anyway, here's some early morning thoughts I had on being an ISFP:  
Perhaps the biggest physical flaw to an ISFP (or maybe this extends past us) is that we are only human. When we experience something that fulfills our senses, it is a but unfortunate that we are confined to the five human senses. As a human these senses have certain physical limits - such as only being able to see/perceive fragments of the color spectrum, or in the same light hear certain sounds, or metaphorically not actually being able to feel the rush of air flowing past and under your wings as you soar through the sky. Now in writing this, I also realize that this so to speak ""flaw"" is also what makes us so amazing and unique. Though we are bound by the human senses while we heavily embrace all the various experiences of our life (music, paintings, photos, food, etc.) that fulfill our senses and in turn ""elevate"" us and our sense of feelings - those limitations are what push us to elongate those experiences and prolong that sensual high. I guess a good analogy would be like searching for that next hit or next ""high"" of whichever drug. More specifically, that is when we take that moment and put it in a different perspective, maybe away from convention even - whether it be changing the perspective, framing, or angle of a photo, shading or coloring a work of art differently, or producing a musical (or non-musical) sound that no one has ever heard - creating that next ""hit"". Honestly this does not apply to just the traditional arts, but can be projected onto any profession, hobbies or interests that a person has as long as you can imagine it. "
1871,isfp,"Its hard for me to have a detailed opinion on what its like being an ISFP. Mainly because I am far from educated on what the differences between each type are. All I know is what was written in my section, and how that relates to me. Which might be exactly what you are asking. I scored above the 85% on all of my letters and 96% on the A. A large portion of what was written there was pretty on the nose for me.
While I find this well written and well expressed. I just couldn't care less. I am me. Its all I'm ever going to be. I don't sit and think about what it means to be an ISFP. I don't know why anyone would. Go ahead and stuff yourself into that box if it makes you happy. I just sit and think about who I am and who I want to be. I don't care what people think about me. I care about what I think about me. If I can love myself the rest will fall into place. I'm sure of it.
Posting this before I try to revise it."
1872,isfp,"^^I absolutely agree. This is very beautifully written, but sounds like what an INFP would say if they were trying to imagine how ISFPs feel. I absolutely am in touch with my senses, but I don‚Äôt think I usually apply such deeper thoughts to my experiences, or think in terms of metaphors. Just some food for thought:)."
1873,isfp,"I hope that box is comfortable. I realize that sounds very rude. It is. I apologize. I wish it wasn't, but I don't retract the statement. I do actually hope the box is comfortable.
God I sound like such a douchebag."
1874,isfp,"I'm pretty sure my sister is an ISFP. It isn't confirmed though. Her life has been so horrible. Ever since she was young she had an abusive father, to getting married to a man who she had a tumultuous relationship with. There was one event that really pushed her over the edge when her husband kind of left. Even after he came back she was never the same. It's like the trauma changed her. She wasn't the same person since then. It's been years and there are moments I see the same light inside that I loved before but it's like she's gone. It's such a bad situation because in some way I feel she could just get better with family but she pushes the ones who want to be with her away, and the others are so busy with their own lives and find it hard to spend so much time with her. I don't even know of this is what will help her. So how would you guys get over a trauma like this? Even if you don't know. Do you guys have any help in this situation? She is also smoking so much, she over eats, and sometimes throws it up purposefully, and she doesn't keep that clean. We have tried to get her to some psychological help or even a doctor but she refuses and it's really hard to get her to go there. So what do you guys think?"
1875,isfp,"a while ago i read a book called The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. i wouldn't advise reading it in order to help her because it's basically a medically oriented thesis on why trauma is so physical and emotional in nature that mentally-focused talk therapy alone doesn't resolve PTSD, but the basic premise was helpful to me because it got me to stop analyzing events and my reactions to them and instead deal with emotions of anger and fear in things like sports, archery, gaming, art, basically just anything physical. even smoking weed, eating, having sex, cuddling, getting massages helped because it's like i was replacing negative physical experiences with positive ones. but i had to have the intention to actually release negative feelings, not just distract myself from them, which did require feeling them.
i think the best thing you can do is tell her that you love her and that you respect and value her as a person, and show this in your behavior. trauma can kind of mess up or eradicate your sense of self (especially in BPD) and it's important to rebuild that."
1876,isfp,"Truthfully I handle trauma in much the same way - not very well. I have had several major losses in my life and I carry them all with me to this day, to some extent.
I do have a therapist but she is one in a million, extremely kind and empathetic. It has to be the right person. Most therapists I have been to were as clinical as a can of Lysol. If your sister found the right fit, she might actually want to go."
1877,isfp,"You said that your sister refuses to see a psychologist. How about a therapist who specializes in trauma? There are some agencies who will provide this kind of service for free or at a reduced cost. 
I bet your sister feels hopeless, attacked, and like you view her as broken. Have you talked to her? Like really talkd to her and learned how she makes sense of everything?"
1878,isfp,I‚Äôm still learning how. At 23 after a life of emotional neglect and abuse from my family I‚Äôve had a suicide attempt been hospitalized and diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I‚Äôm fragile and broken but trying to get better. I see a therapist weekly and a psychiatrist monthly. The meds and therapy help but I‚Äôm a pathetic crumbling human being and I often wish I was just dead so that I could stop the pain. I think about it every night. 
1879,isfp,We actually got her to see a therapist but the therapist but my sister wasn't attending properly and the therapist said there is nothing she can do if my sister song engage. My sister actually seems completely out of it. She kind of seems like a child at times who doesn't know what's going on. 
1880,isfp,With my sister things are slowly getting better. I think with time it will get better. With the suicide attempts. I can relate. I resort to hurting myself sometimes but I always feel bad afterwards. Remember. You said you Received a crumbling human being but that you are trying to get better. Focus on that. You are trying. That so important. Please please please PM me to talk when you need to.
1881,isfp,"Thank you, I ended up calling a hotline last night to get through the night. I have an appointment with my therapist today. I think I may need to get my medication switched. I‚Äôm just been feeling terrible for while now."
1882,isfp,"I just wanted to pop in and say that I haven‚Äôt meant an ISFP I haven‚Äôt liked yet. You guys are awesome.
Our cognitive functions are flipped, which makes you very fascinating to me. I love how you are able to feel deeply and moderate through the complexity. It‚Äôs only in the past 5 years or so been able to develop my Fi enough to enjoy the process.
With that said, I‚Äôm curious how many of you are attracted to us ENTJs? I‚Äôm not talking just romantically, although it would include that. I‚Äôve found that being around my opposite is pleasantly comforting. You guys have a great way of creating space for others and I feel like you women see right through me, which is refreshingly unnerving. It‚Äôs like being stripped of your walls without having to worry about an attack.
Anyhow, I want to thank you for being you and if you have any ENTJ questions, I‚Äôd love to answer them."
1883,isfp,"I haven't met an ENTJ yet but going by their online posts I am fascinated and a lil intimidated by them, and I have questions!


How do we (err some of us) not grate your nerves?! I am the stereotype artsy-fartsy, unapologetically lazy, hippie-like female ISFP and the day I don't mope in misery over an online argument will be a milestone for me. 


What are some marked differences between male and female ENTJs, if any?


Did your Fi develop naturally with age and experience or did you concentrate effort to improve it?


What have you found that you share in common with the ISFPs irl?


Thanks! "
1884,isfp,"I think inferior Te would be frustrating for Te dominants, but I think that only applies to less developed ENTJs or ESTJs. To me, it‚Äôs both endearing and frustrating. I think it only becomes frustrating for me when I know I can help and the other person is unwilling to accept it."
1885,isfp,"That's cause you're guy and women are expected to be submissive and sensitive.
ISFP males are completely different than females, more so than other types because of Se awareness that Fi is not a masculine trait. Not to sound dramatic but just stating facts. You should rephrase it to ""I haven't met an ISFP woman that I haven't liked yet"""
1886,isfp,"Developing your inferior takes a lot of time and energy. I‚Äôll never be as good with Fi like an ISFP, but that isn‚Äôt the point. To me, it‚Äôs about leverage and stability. Meaning, our dominant and inferior functions are connected. They orbit around each other like two planets. The problem is they dramatically differ in size, so they wobble. Growing my Fi balances out my Te. 
I think I would be an ESFP for the day because I would be focused on having so much fun."
1887,isfp,"Ive met a couple of entjs in real life one male and one female and they were both outspoken, abrasive and high energy. I was attracted to the guy and jealous of the girl and too intimidated to talk to either haha :) anyway im glad you appreciate us isfps though. I often feel like a side character in someone else's story."
1888,isfp,"Ahhh, I'm really late to this post but I'll offer my input and hopefully make a small, helpful contribution! :)
I was attracted to a good friend of mine, an ENTJ, when I was in high school, and I actually posted about him on this subreddit before. He was a natural-born leader, charismatic, and liked sticking up for the ""underdogs"", I suppose. 
Once I confronted him about my feelings, however, he kind of grew angry with me and insisted I was far too dramatic and emotional. Needless to say, one thing led to another, and I'm not exactly friends with him anymore. 
This doesn't mean that I hate him at all!! I'll admit it--sometimes, I reminisce about these days and grow a bit bitter; but this is because there was far too much miscommunication between the two of us and, to be quite honest, him and I were far too immature at the time--on my end, due to taking his criticism to heart--on his, misconstruing things I'd said to him as exposing his ""weaknesses"" to embarrass him or bruise his ego--to understand the benefits of, at the very least, developing a strong friendship or relationship.
Despite all of this, you ENTJs are so awesome and encapsulating to me! You just do what you desire because you know that as long as you have the drive, it's possible!! It's super admirable. :)"
1889,isfp,"Hi Madre, nice to meet you.
We‚Äôre very direct, so ENTJ fashion I‚Äôll answer accordingly.


The moping could be irritating if I didn‚Äôt understand the nature of cognitive types and if the ISFP asks for advice and then rejects it. I have learned to only provide advice when I am asked for it. That alleviates most of my frustration. I imagine using a phrase like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a moping mood, so bear with me‚Äù would help. Or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working through this, and I don‚Äôt need you to fix it.‚Äù Those phrases help us disconnect the problem solving mechanism that is hard wired into us.


Male and female ENTJs differ in that society is more accepting of a strong male verses a strong female. I said society intentionally, b cause males and females finish the strength of female ENTJs. With that said, females are often more reserved in how they display their directness. I think they learn to use social graces faster than their male counterparts, but both are natural leaders and desire to be the head of the organization, team, etc. This doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt follow, it‚Äôs just that we rarely find someone who is more capable at leading than we are. But, we are happy to surrender control to those who are capable.


My Fi developed both naturally and intentionally. My failures have caused me to reevaluate how I approach things. Also, I have been obsessed with developing Fi because I believe that your inferior function holds the key to your superpower.


ISFPs and ENTJs share the same cognitive functions in opposite order, so we can understand each other and connect in a way that is profound and interesting. For example, I have an ISFP friend that loves deep conversation, which is where I live ALL THE TIME. Also, I love how she is fully present with each person she meets and has a tremendous grace about her. I have another two male ISFP friends who also crave the deep talks and handle my intensity well.


Furthermore, they all love my ability to distill a complex problem to its most important parts. Then, I address the heart of the matter in a very rapid fashion so that they aren‚Äôt wasting their time in stuckland.
BTW, I love Q&A, so ask anything you like. I‚Äôd be happy to answer any question you have."
1890,isfp,"sorry, read your reply late. That makes perfect sense, balancing out ones dominant function by developing inferior.
Thats all the questions I have. Hope your relationship with the ISFPs^ continue to be fulfilling! :)"
1891,isfp,"We are definitely assertive and naturally confident in our abilities. That can be a problem for others because we tend to steamroll our way through life and people. It is unfortunate, but at some point as we mature, we realize that humans are not pawns. Most of us struggle to remember the human in humanity.
I used to be rather crass and abrasive. I‚Äôve learned that honey is better than vinegar when it comes to influence and communication. This has allowed me to create space for others who don‚Äôt think like I do and to appreciate the differences we bring to the table.
For example, ENTJs create this massive presence to protect our core because fear what others would do if we let our baby Fi out to play. But in marginalizing the threat to our core, we alienate ourselves and wonder if anyone really knows us. Once an ENTJ begins to exercise that vulnerability around those who don‚Äôt flinch, we begin to drop the walls.
We may be very intimidating personalities, but we are little toddlers on the inside capable of the same irrational and endearing emotions we attribute to little children. "
1892,isfp,"Nice to meet you too!
How difficult was it to develop Fi? And have you successfully unlocked the superpower? :P
I've never really thought about developing my Te as much as pensively wishing I had a more pronounced Ti instead of it being on the far end of my shadow functions. I can't exactly pinpoint what constitutes as Te inferior in myself, but I can spot Ti, Ni and Si being used in others simply because they explain how they reached their conclusions afterward.
 Here's a fun question, if you had to live as another type for a week which would you choose?"
1893,isfp,"Why do some ENTJs disappear? One made up dumb lies to cancel a date instead of being honest and the other which considered me a great friend cut contact with me after something happened between us. It comes across as inconsiderate, I don't know if they even identify that with being a horrible friend. "
1894,isfp,"No, I meant while ENTJ males like ISFP women, the same cannot be said for ENTJ women and ISFP men. 
Not to say it cannot work but female brain is wired diferrently and seeks dominance and leadership. Something that ISFP men simply dont care about.
Couple that with societal pressure for women to seek dominance and men to be leaders and you can see why ENTJ woman - ISFP man most likely won't work.
Your title is misleading and makes us think that this combination works for ISFP men too when its just only for ISFP women.
Just my observations from what I've seen. Everytime I've seen a report of thia combo working it was because the man was ENTJ.
When it was the reverse all I've tead was the ENTJ women complaining about their ISFP and nagging ahah"
1895,isfp,"Sorry for the delay supportive. I can‚Äôt really answer specifically why this ENTJ disappeared. I can say that once our mind has changed, our behavior follows very quickly. We are slow to change our mind, but once that happens it seems jarring to others because we often don‚Äôt share that we are switching positions.
Regarding the first ENTJ who lied to you, I am not sure why he did that. It‚Äôs rare for us to compromise our values, so it means that that particular ENTJ doesn‚Äôt value honesty. Personally, I would be thankful to be free of him."
1896,isfp,"That is very true. We can be softies to those we care deeply about. In a lot of ways, we just want to let our walls down to  expose our soft parts, but many of us Te dominant users are afraid of betrayal.
What does an inferior Te look like for ISFPs?"
1897,isfp,"I am. It's hard when your expectations are for others to be as considerate as yourself :-)
As for the ex-friend, I'll chalk it up to a bad egg. Unfortunately, I haven't come across any good experiences with ENTJ as of yet."
1898,isfp,"That's true for isfps too. We have our walls but we act nice because we can't stand toxic environments. We can be too passive.
Inferior te is everything that would piss off entjs "
1899,isfp,"Hi guys! I'm an ENFP writer, and I'd like a little assistance with a project I'm working on if anyone is interested in contributing. I'm curious to see if there are similarities between movie preferences for each personality type. If you want to help out, list your top 3-5 films from any genre, and feel free to explain why if you are so inclined. 
Thanks in advance, and have fun!!!"
1900,isfp,"
Matrix (only the 1st one) it has a very big sentimental value as I use to watch it with my brothers and dad, and we watched it a lot...
Hitch Hikers guide to the galaxy, I love the books.
A million ways to die in the west. got me through an emotional time.
The dark Knight, I mean greatest Joker performance ever. 
The Prestige, some of my favorite actors in one movie. 

I have more but you said 3-5 :o. So I limited it xP"
1901,isfp,"It would be easier if you had a list to check because there are too many movies and all my favorites would probably not have much overlap with others:
Children of Paradise
Son of White Mare
M
Force Majeure
Stalker"
1902,isfp,"The Prestige- the first movie that got my into my now favorite genre, mindfuck/psychological thrillers
Interstellar- Went to the theater with no background of what the movie was about because I was bored and couldn't stop thinking about the movie for a good two or three weeks afterward. Everything about that movie was perfect. It was so aesthetically pleasing to look at and the premise itself immersed me into a movie more than other movie I can think of. Also, this was the first movie I watched multiple times in theater. 
Memento- Honestly, I just love Christopher Nolan.
The Truman Show- I get a warm, fuzzy feeling when I even think of this movie lol I can't explain exactly what about it I love though. I get the same feeling from movies like ""Harriet, the Spy"", and that one movie where the whole town is black and white because it's an old tv show and then tobey macguire and his sister ""corrupt"" it and things start to have color. I think I get a nostalgia feeling from the movies since I loved them when I was younger? Idk, but they give me guaranteed instant feel good vibes.
Synechdoche, New York- It makes me uncomfortable and made me think of a lot of questions I usually wouldn't.
edit: Just to add, my favorite movies tend to be either stupid funny like ""This is the End"", psychological thriller like the ones listed above, or dystopian/sci-fi like ""In Time"". "
1903,isfp,"Hot Fuzz
Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World
The Emperor's New Groove
Shaun of The Dead
Shrek - The Original 
I have always been more inclined to watch an action film more so than a comedy one but my most favorite movies tend to amusingly be comical in nature. I'm someone who is a big fan of fantasy settings and would absolutely love a big hit Lord of the Rings esque franchise to release in the near future. A good one, aha. I actually found the Harry Potter movies intriguing too. Such fantastic atmosphere. "
1904,isfp,"E.T.  It is just a perfect movie IMO. The score is amazing and it's just so beautifully done.
Star Wars (1977) The one that started it all. The original cantina scene is probably my favorite scene from all of the SW movies. Such a great introduction to a larger world. 
Hunt for the Wilderpeople. I love the flight of the conchords-esque style of humor and there is so much heart in this movie too. So glad to see Taika Waititi directing Thor Ragnarok
Drive. Beautifully shot and the soundtrack kicks ass. I love how this movie is just one giant crescendo.
Shaun of the Dead/Forgetting Sarah Marshall. My favorite comedies. The jokes just never let up with either of them and both are so well written"
1905,isfp,I realize I'm pretty late to the party here but I think you should consider a different format for these. I think you're getting a lot of response bias from people seeing a movie that was already commented and since it's in their minds they'll comment it too.
1906,isfp,"Almost all of Miyazaki's films are fantastic. Sometimes I won't be able to put into words exactly what the morals of his films are but I always feel satisfied after watching them. Also, Hisaishi's music is equally stunning. "
1907,isfp,"Inception - The concept of constructing worlds and committing all sorts of deeds inside another person's dreams is mind-bogglingly awesome! It takes lucid dreaming to whole new level. It's very abstract and subtle but still told in such a way it's easy to grasp what is going on.
28 Days Later - Rage.. It's not voodoo, it's not scary black magic, it's not a super secret military experiment gone wrong. It's just rage. ""Just rage"". It's in the blood.. I love the music and the setting and how well Cillian Murphy displays confusion and fear.
Cast Away - I can't really put my finger on why I like this movie so much, but I re-watch it at least once a year since it came out and when it first came out I watched it a bunch of times. It might be that the idea of losing everything and starting over with absolutely nothing on a desert island is very romanticized and somewhat compelling. Coping with the thought that nobody knows what happened to you, and that they must all go on with their lives thinking you're dead. There's so much despair and a touch of dread and just general sadness in this movie that I can't not watch it."
1908,isfp,So I‚Äôve taken the test about 3 times in my life(currently 22) and the first time I got ISFP and the last 2 times I‚Äôve gotten ESFP. I like to be outgoing and be excited and enjoying peoples company. And then sometimes I just want to go home or barely stay at a party because I just get tired and drained of people. Which isn‚Äôt the way for an ESFP. Do I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has felt this way also? Because I really do enjoy entertaining people and making them laugh. Sorry if I seem so scattered with my thoughts.
1909,isfp,"To me it sounds like you‚Äôre ISFP, because I am similar when it comes to being social. I enjoy being around my friends and talking to them, but once the group becomes bigger than ~5 people (including me), I start feeling drained.
It‚Äôs also possible that you are closer to the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum, causing you to feel both ways. You may want to read up more on ISFP and ESFP to see which one you relate to better to aid you in deciding which one you are. "
1910,isfp,"It‚Äôs all about your cognitive functions. I would probably guess you‚Äôre more of an ISFP as you‚Äôre describing feeling tired and drained from parties and people at times. ISFP also lead with Fi, which is different from the ESFP leading with Se. "
1911,isfp,"Do you feel like you're always the one who initiates?
I mean when texting friends in order to hang out with them or to do whatever else, it seems that it's always me who have to initiate or I will not be included in the group. I think other people assume that I'm not interested in doing anything with them when I really am. I think this cause loneliness. Any thoughts on this ?"
1912,isfp,"that was me back in early days in higschool, that was almost a decade ago thoguh, now tests come back as ISTP, which on the F or T scale i'm only slightly on the thinker side than the f, on the results, it says 87% thinker, but i somehow doubt that. i don't initiate texts anymore unless i'm really bored which is quite rare, want to catch up, or i need something, i got other things to worry about, sometimes i ignore texts and calls altogether"
1913,isfp,"No, but I also don't hang out with friends that often so maybe if I initiated more I would hang out more. I know one guy who texts me every few weeks asking if I want to hang out and I try to go, but I moved kind of far away so it's hard to get there lately. 
it would be very helpful for my social life if I started initiating more though, I am just not used to it. I am more reserved & passive by nature but I kind of hate that sometimes. I probably give off an uninterested vibe"
1914,isfp,"There is  no arbitrary axis.  The test yoh took generally might point u in right dir by tendancies.   thst is all.
Comsider the cognitive stack of the types....or u making MBTI basucallly same laughingsgock as horoscopes
I think it is awesome you might be  nollicing  patterns?
That is fun?   Just letting you know you wre led to believe mbti is 4 false axis dichotomies.    You cant be some % on a spectrum    Not on a leading test with like 70 questikns obvious  in to intent and easy to game."
1915,isfp,"Have you guys ever heard or tried this memory technique? I highly suspect ISFPs would be good with this method.  Basically you visualize items in a house and you attach a value on it. INTJs can probably use it as well, never worked for me unfortunately. Regardless I'm curious if you can actually use it and if so how far could you push it.
Hey, you might wanna look it up, could be useful if you're still in school or need to absorb information weekly."
1916,isfp,"Instead of visualization, I'd think that ISFPs would do better with kinesthetic-style memory techniques. Such as copying down something by writing, doing physical activities, roleplaying even. Some people memorize by mirroring and taking note on body movement. I've recently heard of a method that involves snapping a rubber hand on your wrist during a lecture whenever important information is said. Since no one replied I'm assuming that the method of loci is not prominent in ISFPs, or at least not the ones on this subreddit. I imagine that some ISFPs may be turned off by it since they'd rather root memories in the physical world, videos, writing, etc. Correct me if I'm wrong, ISFPs! On that topic, I've found that some of the ISFPs I know keep diaries because they have things they would like to remember and it may be hard for them to recall their pasts clearly as opposed to, say, ISxJs. Or poetry. I strongly suspect they write poetry in their diaries. Not like they'd ever show me though."
1917,isfp,"No need to be disappointed, try asking an ENxP or something. I haven't been successful with attempting the method of loci either because I tend to overwrite whatever I attach to an item. It doesn't stick well and I end up skipping steps which makes not as useful to me as much as I like the potential it has, especially since it is a sequential way of memorizing information. Maybe if I had something I really needed to memorize that I wouldn't mind bringing up whenever I enter the mind palace."
1918,isfp,"That's not a bad thing, i'm pretty sure you're supposed to. The point is to have the item and not having something attached to it forever. 
ISFPs have a strong symbolic associative mind. It seems to me that this method should be possible for this type. I've known a few ISFPs and most of them were really good with learning languages. Easily picking on the etymology of a word, never making a spelling mistake simply because of that ability.
Ne gives the ability to mentally reorganize information, a restructuration of different blocks but that's not the same as assigning an identity to a picture or a symbol while being able to navigate yourself between them and seeing clear links of ideas or even identities. "
1919,isfp,"Ah, yeah, I've had that experience with ISFPs too. The reason I chose Ne was because they could form strange associations with objects, and that information is more easily remembered since it sticks out and is amusing. I suppose different types could use the method of loci differently. Se-Ni would be more inclined to link together the objects in a certain space to a theme, and the associations between objects connect to others, based on its proximity to one another. While the Ne-Si approach doesn't have to be so intertwined and themed, like making up a story with random components that are not all of importance. It would be interesting to see an ISFP's point of view, for sure. They're more attentive to their environments too."
1920,isfp,"I know i keep posting a lot here but i was just looking at the instagrams of people i graduated highschool with (2012). They seem so... Grown up. I know we're all 24 or 25 but like.. I feel about 5 years younger than they seem to me. 
I feel the same as i did when i was 20 pretty much. I dont know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. 
I went on a night walk with a friend just chatting recently and we passed through down town, stopping in to use the restroom at a bar. Everyone seemed so much older than me even though a lot of them were probably my age or younger. I guess its cus i dont really go out drinking so the bar scene is fairly foreign for me. But ive never felt more out of place and separated from them.  Im not immature (i think?) its not like i havent changed or grown since i was 19 or 20... Ive done the partying and the sleeping around and those things no longer interest me. So ive moved on in many ways. But still i just dont feel im on the level of other people my age.
Does anyone else feel like theyre a lot younger than their age?"
1921,isfp,"I'm too sensitive to other people, yet it's impossible to avoid people altogether.  Why can't I just be an insensitive asshole like everyone else? It's impossible to describe how much certain people bug me just by standing there looking at me. I can feel their eyes and it feels disgusting. Creeps. Even if they're just walking past me, or standing. These guys have no idea the kind of energy they're putting off. It is gross, and they are disgusting human beings.
Not speaking about all extraverts, cuz I know some and they can be great, but I hate my sensitivity to certain creepy motherfuckers who are so insensitive to the kind of shitty swamp beings they are.
Fuck, I'm sure someone else here can relate? It's a living hell. And I honestly can't even bring myself to talk to these sludge monsters to tell them to fuck off. I feel like I'll be contaminated. 
Sorry if you think this is a bad post cuz it's ""negative"" so will get downvoted, as it is on Reddit, but I honestly just want someone to tell me they know how it feels, so I'm not the only one suffering here.
Sorry if you're personally offended by this post, I know some have already been offended. And no I don't have any form of psychosis. I just know some creeps who will physically growl at me and follow me with their eyes as I walk by. Their negative intentions are clear to me. Not trying to be a ""jerk,"" cuz retaliating in defense isn't what jerks do."
1922,isfp,"Maybe you should change the aspect of yourself that you change. 
The less time you spend with others the more you will hate, because you will see yourself changing and having fun and only occasionally check to see what others are doing, what they are putting forth. Aka not the whole picture
Tldr go outside and talk to somebody. Be nice and they will be aswell"
1923,isfp,"Not an ISFP, but I get that feeling sometimes too, and I'm a dude.  On the other hand, I get the feeling some people feel that way about me, and I know I'm not creepy.  Some of the more bold ones will come forth and tell me I'm intimidating but realized I was a big softy after getting to know me.
Not sure how old you are, but maybe it's an overactive and underdeveloped Ni?  Or it also could be that lechers are just attracted to you :)"
1924,isfp,"Holy fuck, I relate so damn hard... I know the exact same feeling so much, it makes me want to cry. I'm actually surprised that there were people out there experiencing ""sludge monsters"" who just stand and stare at you. The worst is when they come uninvited to your friend group that is usually fun and ruin the mood with their uncannily creepy presence. I wish I could tell them to fuck off so damn hard. Fuck."
1925,isfp,"I feel its an age thing. I used to feel the same and now looking back I'm annoyed i even cared or wasted energy getting worked up over petty shit. The older you get the less you'll care about nobody's.
Edit: just re-read the post. Don't want to come across as insensitive to what you're saying. My partner is probably what you have been describing but some people are just like that, does not mean they are bad people. Currently working to make him more chill haha. "
1926,isfp,"Heyyyy, what are you? Your type. I'm not sure I'm an isfp either and I'm trying to figure out my type, and you sound just like me. 
Yeah I get the feeling people feel very intimidated by me too even though I'm nice, so I dunno. They are visibly scared. And I'm no one to be scared of, so it's weird. I guess I'm so introverted that I'm mulling over deep problems all the time, and that's what's intimidating them."
1927,isfp,"Yeah, ew. Same, I can't bring myself to talk to these freaks. Glad you understand. C: Everyone else thinks I'm crazy or have some mental disorder. And by everyone I mean intjs, ugh.
Are you an isfp? I think I'm an istp from this test I took."
1928,isfp,"Wait I just took it again and this is what I got:
27%¬†INFP
20%¬†ENFP
14%¬†ISFP
10%¬†ESFP
9%¬†ESTP
Took this damn robot 45 questions. Apparently it was just as confused as I was, and it still didn't give me a high definitive percentage. 
But they are almost all Fs, which makes sense."
1929,isfp,"You're like the only person so far who's understood this. I posted this in r/intj, and they had negative responses, and said I had psychosis. Maybe I accidentally posted it there instead of r/istj, but still. Damn, intjs get on my nerves. They have no concept of anything other than their own thoughts.
But as far as these creeps go, they must not know how they affect us or they wouldn't blatantly do such stupid things to us. So unnecessary to not be decent human beings to us. I honestly think they must be stupid or something. Introverts are smarter, so we are confused why people do these dumb things. 
Idk if it'll get better for a while, I'm 10 years younger than you. Ya I'm starting to stand up to them more, but it's really scary actually, and I would say more, but I just don't wanna get involved with that creepy feeling. It's a creepy feeling I get in my heart and it's scary, goes down my whole body and it makes me want to stay away and not want to interact with them at all. How do you overcome this?"
1930,isfp,"I'm INFJ.  ISFP sounds kind of your speed though, they either come off as intimidating or super chill.
Anyway, can't change how folks see us.  If it's the same people who give you these looks it might be worth it to confront them, even though it's stupid hard for ISFPs to do.  I suppose the emotionally intelligent thing to do would be to not assume and realize that if we come off as intimidating, others might come off as shitty swamp beings :)"
1931,isfp,"Really? Hmm okay, maybe that's what I am then.
I guess everyone's just the way the are or whatever and don't worry about it. Makes sense. Just dunno how to deal with it really, other than to blow up or stay quiet. It's extremely off-putting and I overreact to it. "
1932,isfp,"Honestly your post details don't give much hint to your cognitive functions.  You seem to be very much After, and you care about what others think so that leans toward Fe, and you read the way people look at you which is Se, but perceiving and feeling aren't typically both extraverted, so you might INFJ or ISFJ that leads with Feeling.
Also, the introvert/extravert thing in MBTI doesn't mean you like going out and meeting new people vs shutting in, it's which of your two functions you extravert, so you might be a ExFx."
1933,isfp,"You will either prefer to interact with the world or your inner self with each of your functions.  If you are ISFP you will tend to act outwardly with sensing (sight/sound/taste) but judge inwardly based on your internal core values.  Additionally, the tertiary function for ISFPs is introverted intuition, which as a tertiary function means that the ISFP gets gut feelings, but the subconscious isn't as developed as the dominant intuition of the INFJ, typically because thoughts of the future aren't as optimistic due to living in the moment."
1934,isfp,"Well I got 51% istp on John's personality test
http://jupiter-34.appspot.com
They say it's one of the most accurate.
So introverted is my primary mode of living, so it kinda does mean I'd stay in my room a lot. "
1935,isfp,"One of my closely held values is that I never speak badly about a person with another person because it feels insincere. Therefore I can't really understand why people do this to each other all the time. If someone starts shit-talking the other person I try to at least sympathize with them or explain to the person I'm talking with where they might be coming from. I certainly get annoyed when others do this to me. I know it's a bit ironic since I usually can't handle criticism (or more like I hold too much to my own viewpoint), but I'd usually rather people be direct to me. I usually understand things when they are said directly, and it actually feels like they're being respectful to me as a person. I know I can't avoid it, but when others are saying stuff behind my back and I find out about it, it makes me feel ignored as a person and very annoyed and disappointed that they would do this to me. Anyone else relate?"
1936,isfp,"Yep, can relate. Even if they might be right I try to see both sides. Sometimes I catch myself thinking badly about a person for some reason and even then I try to understand them and kind of argue with myself. Hehe."
1937,isfp,"I haven't got too much to add - i try to just let people be.
But when someone criticises me from a place of care, wanting the best for me, those are some of my favourite memories from my life.  
they've tried to see my life with these changes, thought carefully about my predicaments. i'd never asked for anything like that, but it felt like such a gift.  
But, I've heard people joke vindictively about my friends and i've wanted to tear their faces off."
1938,isfp,Absolutely. I prefer to not say anything about someone behind their back that is untrue and/or something I wouldn't have the balls to say to their face. When I hear about people saying things behind my back that they wouldn't say to my face or that isn't true (and goes against my rules for myself) I get pissed and typically either confront them or just cut them out of my life entirely with no explanation to them.
1939,isfp,"i think the distinction is how close / how well they know the person  
if they respect the person and it;s just a vent, then such is life. if it's shallow bullying/character destruction based on fuck all, then i'll call them a cunt."
1940,isfp,"I worked with a counsellor for over a year for my anxiety which would leave me homebound all the time, constantly overthinking and stressing about the what-ifs and worst case scenarios And these thoughts often prevented me from getting a job and keeping it, maintaining contact with friends, etc. . I found what helped me tremendously was her suggestion to make ‚Äúspace‚Äù between myself and my thoughts by making a habit of just DOING something when I find myself heavily in my thoughts and anxious. I think this is related to being ISFP. We are naturally doers and being in our heads as opposed to being in touch and engaged with physical surroundings is not our natural mode (at least I have found this to be the case with myself). So whenever I find myself becoming sucked in to anxiety or overthinking, I find any activity that is convenient and that will get me engaged and out of my thoughts. For example, sometimes when I know I have to go to work when I‚Äôm feeling off or go do something I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy I become anxious and overthink all of the ways that it will be the worst time. Instead of sitting and overthinking about it and letting it leave me immobile, I get up, listen to music and take my time getting myself ready and try to focus on the present moment rather than what my anxious thoughts are trying to draw my attention to. I find it is best to nip it in the butt as soon as possible and to just go and do anything right when you notice it, to prevent you from getting sucked into an overthinking cycle. Sometimes I‚Äôll just go for a drive and listen to music, or go to a store and browse, find a show to lose myself in or do things around the house. 
I hope this helps! "
1941,isfp,"Dead on.
It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a productive activity. Sex, sports, and music (dancing) are my go-to these days because I stay at home a lot, but in the past I found going to the gym, getting out in nature, hula hooping, science museums, the zoo, etc. were all helpful methods of distraction."

Thank you!"
1943,isfp,"INFJs are supposed to be the rarest type, and yet 22% of responses are from INFJs, making them by far the most common according to this survey. Either people are screwing with you, or people really want to think they're INFJs when they're not."
1944,isfp,"Good observation, I hadn't picked up on that yet. I would assume that's two things, one is a majority of my contributors were intuitives themselves and therefore more likely to date another intuitive. Secondly, I think INTJ is likely a common misdiagnosis for people's ex or boyfriend/girlfriend. Like ""my ex-boyfriend was a total robot with no feelings, must be a intj"". "
1945,isfp,"No, INFJs are just drawn to MBTI and using the internet. ESTJs and ENFJs are more common in society but aren't going to go on a subreddit all day for personality psychology and take a survey. They are off living taking care of babies and being CEOs and whatnot."
1946,isfp,"I'm a INFP myself and I seem to have a tendency to gravitate towards you guys in my friendships and love interests.
How do you guys define betrayal within your social circles?
How do you deal with the person in question in the aftermath phase?
If you are the type to be more forgiving/ ability to give multiple chances how do you proceed with the person? Can you ever be real close again or do you always proceed cautiously if so?
I appreciate any sort of response as I want to understand you guys better."
1947,isfp,"I find that I often do little courtesy's for other people that I usually consider to be standards and can find it incredibly frustrating when they don't return the favor if I ask for it. For example, punctuality is really important to me when it comes to meeting with my friends. If I say, ""Hey, I'm going to pick you up at 3:45"" then you can bet I'll be there as close to 3:45 as possible. But there have been times where the situation has been reversed, where I'll have to go out of my way to find out when a friend will pick me up, and he shows up half an hour later causing us to almost be late, and it doesn't even occur to him that what he did was discourteous.
Stuff like that eats at me for a while. Like /u/reallyuniqueid said, I'll almost always forgive, but I probably won't forget. I usually try to avoid confronting them though because I don't want to damage our relationship, unless it happens multiple times."
1948,isfp,"I would define a betrayal as someone using me for my kindness and willfully taking advantage of me. I may be nice, but I'm not stupid, and even though I probably wouldn't confront anyone or call them out, I'd remember that incident and probably dislike that person. I feel like I have a highly attuned sensitivity to when people are being ""fake"" to me, too, like trying to act a certain way to my face that doesn't genuinely reflect their feelings. This makes me trust someone less. Another form of betrayal for me would be to hurt or take advantage of one of my friends or family members.
I would try on the surface to be forgiving, but I think if someone really wronged me or one of my friends or family members, I wouldn't truly be able to forgive them in my heart. I could probably superficially be their friend and would be nice to them and look out for them on some level, but I would never truly trust them or confide in them. "
1949,isfp,"---intro
Hi Im a male college student who's been pursuing a female a my school. Please read all of it and tell me anything you think!
So, there's this girl I've gone on 1 date with, and have talked to for 2 and a half weeks. She was in one of my classes last semester, but we matched on tinder recently, and that's how we linked. For the first week after I match with her, we have great conversations over text. Things go great. She not only responds but also makes a deliberate effort to carry on the conversation unlike many women I match with. After the week I start snapchatting her and get her Instagram as well as her ""finsta."" Things seem to be going too well because I had considered her ""out of my league,"" but my friends tell me otherwise. So I eventually ask her out and she agree to the date, place, AND location without hesitation. (Wow?)
---Red Flag 1 (the night before the date)
I considered this girl really special because even though she was really attractive, she didn't seem like a party animal or a ""hoe."" The night before the day of the date, she suddenly edits her profile on tinder, which she hadn't done in the timeframe since we matched. She switches up some pictures and adds ""down to party so hmu! (heart emoji)"" Then she proceeds to post a video on her finsta which is basically a recording of her semi-embarrassingly showing off a hickey on her neck. Caption is ""Wild throwbacks from the past."" Yes girls can have their fun too, but who posts that kind of stuff on their Instagram, and what is the point of doing that? It just bothered me. 
---The day of the date
The day of the date comes, and we are supposed to have lunch. She arrives 15 minutes late, but that's okay as she apologized. She is gorgeous and VERY into me, to the point that I'm thinking, ""Am I that attractive?"" Constant eye-contact and smiles, everything goes great during the date. We both agree that we want to see each other again. But during the date, I did run into some things that bothered me. 
---Red flag (during the date) 
First of all, her age is fake, and she never mentioned it. It says she is 19, but she's 18. That means that she's had a tinder account for at least a year, while in how school. So curiously, I ask some questions about her past experiences. She says she's had her ""fair share"" of messing around on the app, which I interpret as hooking up people.  When asked about relationships, she says she's had three serious relationships. To me this just doesn't add up. I've been thinking she was this nice innocent good girl, but now she's suddenly a 18 year-old who's had 3 serious relationships, who's hooked up with enough guys and now wants something serious. But she's only 18? If my interpretations are true, I would never date this girl. 
---Red Flags ( after date)
So as soon as I get home, I snapchat her saying how I enjoyed her company would love to take her out again. She responds after 8 hours, around 1 oclock, because apparently she had been partying all night. However, her snapscore has gone up at least 100. Then she posts another photo on Instagram, with her and another guy with his arm around her showing them having fun. This post is captioned, "" Tonight was wild (heart emoji)"". The man in the photo comments, ""(heart emoji)"" At this point I realize that she may not be the person I pictured, and is probably seeing other guys too. 
---continued
So We've been going back and forth on snapchat for a bit now. Her response times and steadily getting slower but at times she responds within an hour. The thing that bothers me is that she is on snapchat all the time, and I can see when she last opened the app because she is visible on snapmaps. Her score goes up a fuck ton everyday, but she seems to take her sweet time not reading my snap and responding after a millenia. Another extremely weird thing I noticed is that when I check where she is through snapmaps around 10-11pm or even later, she is at different places each time. I'm talking about 3 different towns and cities. Sometimes she's in the middle of fucking nowhere. My pessimistic and insecure mind just pictures her fucking a  random dude in a car or an apartment everynight.
---Conclusion.
I know I overthink and seem insecure, but this dating game just drains me too hard. Whatever comes up to your mind after reading this, please comment. I need whatever I can get. Advice, support, guidance? Anything. Help. I really want to learn from this experience. "
1950,isfp,"I would advise you to move on. The only goods points about her from your post seemed to be that she is attractive and paid attention to you. The red flags you mentioned, are factors you shouldn't ignore. "
1951,isfp,"You sound like you liked her more before than afterwards when you truly knew what her nature was. It also sounds like you are constantly being put under stress with this person and I don't think that's healthy for you. I too think that you should learn to move on because it doesn't sound like she is too into you, more like just leading you on. Has she ever gone to you for guidance or talk to you about serious matter or things that she feels about inside? That's usually a sign that they trust and take an interest in you. Or does she just mostly want to have fun because she is lonely and anyone's company will do for the experience? It's like she is causing you more harm that it should and it shouldn't be like that. If you don't like or want to play her mind dating games then don't. Staying more would just lead to more hurt and pain in the end on both sides.  Who knows, she could be thinking differently about you on the inside than the actual outside appearance. It sounds like you already know her enough to know what things you like and don't like, which you seem to feel more of.  If you don't like where you are standing in the relationship, then what reason is there to stay trapped in it? I mean you could probably still be friends and all, but I don't think this is the romantic relationship you were hoping to find and be in serous, long terms with. Why would you want to stay with someone who doesn't truly value their time with you? Someone who wants to know how you feel and shows interest in everything about you. I feel you should have gotten to know her more and finding out more of who she is as a person long term before asking her out on dates and such. You have got it backwards and are now regretting or contemplating about it for a long time when the answer is obvious. You want out and probably don't want to hurt anyone's feelings in the process, but that can be inevitable. You're probably going to have to talk to her about this if you feel that it isn't right for you guys to date anymore and for some closure on the matter. But you can still be friends, just maybe not the romantic type. Hopefully this has helped you to realize some of the things you haven't thought about before."
1952,isfp,"Thanks for such a thoughful response! I agree with most of what you said. I just want honesty, simplicity, comfort, and assurrance in dating, and its hard to find this since Im so sensitive and emotional."
1953,isfp,"You're welcome! I'm glad you found it helpful. ^^ It's good that you know what you want in a relationship and I'm sure you'll find what you are looking for. You probably just need to look a little harder or maybe not. It may take some of us longer than others, but I'm sure you'll find that special someone for only you. It may not be right now, but it will happen in time. Good luck! =)"

Dominant for ISFP and INFP
Auxiliary for ESFP and ENFP
In this chapter, we seek to present a picture of the ‚Äúpure‚Äù Introverted Feeling that we would see if we could carefully remove it from its natural state where it is influenced and colored by all the other elements of personality. Though no process actually exists separated from the rest of the personality, the portrait that follows reflects core characteristics that are in play whenever Introverted Feeling is engaged at a conscious level.
Introverted Feeling most clearly resembles the descriptions in the following pages when it is in the dominant (first) position. In fact, these descriptions are based on input from people for whom the process is dominant (ISFP and INFP). But even with Introverted Feeling in the first position, what you observe will vary noticeably depending on other factors-particularly whether it is paired up with Extraverted Sensing or Extraverted Intuiting in the auxiliary (second) position.
In order to draw a complete picture of the ‚Äúessence‚Äù of Introverted Feeling, one must use bits and pieces that cannot individually demonstrate ‚Äúpure‚Äù Fi. Like the splashes of color in an impressionist painting, however, the bullets in this chapter, when taken all together, reveal a vivid portrait that will enable you to recognize Introverted Feeling when you see it. Knowing what the process would look like if it could be separated from other influences is the foundation of process watching, the practice that will quickly take you as far as you want to go in understanding personality.
Introverted Feeling is a decision-making process. It focuses on the subjective, internal world of absolute personal value systems and assesses all things based upon whether they uphold the values, conflict with them, or have no impact. Fi wants to make choices and act in ways that create and maintain inner harmony.
KEY FEATURES
Introverted Feeling

Is a subjective decision-making process that is based on personal values.
Holds private and nonnegotiable core values deep within.
Accepts life as it happens and embraces the individuality of others, up to a point.  
Quietly exudes a peaceful, grounded aura.
Does not tolerate violations of its core beliefs.
Relates to people one-on-one through a fine-tuned sensitivity to the inner life of others.
Seeks inner harmony.

WHAT‚ÄôS GOING ON?
Introverted Feeling

Is the most subjective of the four decision-making processes.
It probably originates many concepts that have come to be seen as unchallengeable rights, such as justice and freedom.
Develops expertise in recognizing and cultivating inner harmony.
Has a focus on the individual, not the collective.
Is the only mental process with a truly nonnegotiable element.

When people are using their preferred Introverted Feeling

Their beliefs are personal and not influenced by the established value  systems of their culture
They may hold personal, unique versions of widely accepted cultural  values. Some of their values maybe unrelated to the existing cultural norms, and some may even conflict with them.
They hold deep, not broad, beliefs.
Their awareness of a conflict with their values often comes literally through gut feelings. These physical sensations signal when something is wrong or out of line with their internal values and beliefs
Sometimes it is only when their values are violated that they become aware of the values.
They may view virtually anything as innately good or innately bad, as positive or negative.
They use a decision-making process that is too personal to share. * Discussing it is not generally a productive exercise.
They need to ‚Äúfeel right‚Äù about things.
Nurturing and protecting their inner emotional life is their primary goal.
Internal harmony is more than desirable: it is critical to their well-being.
Their aim is an internal life that is Utopian and not defined or limited by the realities of the physical world, such as human nature or the laws of physics.
Comfort lies within their internal belief systems.
They have difficulty consciously accessing their values. They may not even be consciously aware of what some of them are.
They often have great sensitivity to internal harmony or disharmony in others.
They are adept at knowing when something is wrong or right with others.
Bringing their inner system of values to fruition in the real world is usually not important to them.

FROM THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN
When we experience people who are engaging their preferred Introverted Feeling, they

Are outwardly very tolerant of other people‚Äôs values, as long as those values are not in direct conflict with their own.
Have a strong sense of right and wrong.
Hold passionately to their internal beliefs.
Tend to be easygoing, tolerant, and flexible unless their core beliefs become involved.
May not be able to find the right words to adequately express their values, even when these values do come to the surface.
Show so little of themselves to the outside world that who they are may remain a mystery to people around them, often even to their spouses.
Are often not aware of how they affect the world and people around them.
May take very good care of people one-on-one, based upon recognizing and accepting that we all have unique needs and values
Have sensitivity to others‚Äô inner calmness or turmoil, which often results in their forming relatively deep personal relationships. They will not force themselves on others, but they will usually know, for example, about the personal lives and issues of their coworkers. They know who is married, who has children issues, who has elder-care issues, who has relationship problems, and who is unhappy in their job; and they will often try to help them out.
Have an essential honesty and integrity that is not usually displayed for others to see. It is who they are, part of their very being.
Learn not to talk about hot-button topics, such as religion or politics. Their values are personal and subjective, so they may not match the culturally acceptable or politically correct values of the day. Since their deeply held values cannot be altered, they assume that everyone else‚Äôs values are unchangeable too, so talking about them can accomplish nothing but to create stress.
Reveal clues to their real core values through the level of passion in their voice when they speak about something that is important to them.
Make statements about decisions like ‚Äúthis feels right to me.‚Äù
Will listen without challenging or making a judgment right up to the point where something conflicts with their values. At that point, the violator may simply be shut off, instantly excluded from their world.
May cut off a relationship because their value system has been threatened, without giving any indication that anything has changed. The other person may not even be aware of what has happened. Will resist data that appears to conflict with their values. In such a situation, they adapt very slowly or not at all. 
May express their values in ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù statements since their need for inner harmony is personal.
Often form strong bonds with other people who share the Introverted Feeling preference. The bonds can be so strong that there is no great need to talk. Just being together is enough.
Are usually very easy for others to talk to. They are very nonjudgmental, as long as their private belief system is not violated.
Assume that everyone‚Äôs values are absolute, so there is no sense in disputing or even trying to understand them.
Have unquestioning faith in their own values.
Usually appear neutral on the outside. Internally they can be warm, caring, and empathetic, or they may be critical and scornful if their values have been threatened. It is usually hard for others to tell what is going on inside.
Need to be drawn into a decision-making process when the decision has nothing to do with their values. In such a situation, they will usually not get very energized by the discussion. They may not have a strong opinion one way or another. This is often mistaken for indecisiveness.
With multiple choices, they may care about some but not all of the options. They may say, for example, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care which restaurant we choose, but definitely not that one because they don‚Äôt pay their staff a living wage.‚Äù
Provide the ethical backbone of any country, culture, ethnic group, or organization.
Adapt to situations by ignoring anything that is unpleasant or distasteful unless it violates a value. Until a value is violated, nothing brings out their energy or effort to become involved.
Will usually leave a job, regardless of the consequences, if they find that their values are at odds with those of their employer.
Tend to be polite people.
Influence others primarily through their behavior. They lead by example.
Project an inner harmony and an easy going attitude, regardless of what is actually going on inside.
Tend to be very genuine and sincere.
Exude an inner dignity and charm: the perfect gentleman or lady.
Often attract others to them because of their serenity.
May arrange their personal spaces to promote serenity.

FROM THE INSIDE
Paraphrased descriptions of what it is like to make decisions through one‚Äôs preferred Introverted Feeling

My values come from a gut level. If someone ever got me to talk about them, I would be explaining, not discussing, them. The values comes first. They are just there.
If I had felt really strongly about the issue and felt safe to talk about it, I would have said something.
It‚Äôs very hard for me to take a stand publicly. I have to spend time trying it on to see whether it feels right. When I do take a stand, it comes out very passionately and I am not open to debating or discussing the issue.
As a manager, I hate personnel evaluations. I do not like to be evaluated by my manager, and I do not like to evaluate my subordinates. People are who they are and they do what they do. * Normally, I don‚Äôt feel I have a right or a need to judge them. I don‚Äôt give out many pats on the back either, because I do not need them and I forget that others do.
I can feel when people are with me or against me.
I use humor and sarcasm as a way to keep my values from becoming public. I need to deflect attention from this very personal place. If necessary, I may literally run away rather than reveal my values.
I could never work for someone who has values that conflict with mine.
My personal space is very important to me. Please don‚Äôt invade my physical and emotional space.
Rules have to feel right to me or I‚Äôll ignore them.
What I need most from people is affirmation, acceptance, and my freedom.
I hate being labeled or told what I think. If people don‚Äôt check with me, they do not have a clue who I really am.
My internal beliefs are very powerful and nonnegotiable. They just are.
I have a sense of right or wrong and of good or bad, which usually comes to me as a physical sensation in the very center of my body.
Paraphrased descriptions of what it is like to make decisions
‚ÄúGut feeling‚Äù is a literal description. When something is wrong, it makes me sick to my stomach.
If I even try to compromise my values, my heart starts pounding.
I often know a lot about the details of the lives of individuals in my circle, though very few people, if any, know me as intimately.
Often, in order to avoid hurting other people, I will do whatever it takes to please them, unless it comes to the point where they are violating my boundaries. Then I‚Äôll close the door on them without even being aware that I have shut them out.
I‚Äôve learned that I need to let people know about my boundaries sooner. I‚Äôve learned that they can‚Äôt see them and may violate them by accident.
I‚Äôm really good at helping in an emotional crisis.
I pick up a lot on other people‚Äôs feelings, often before they do themselves.
I have a sense of right and wrong that I cannot explain. When it comes into play, it cannot be shaken. It‚Äôs just innate, a part of who I am.
If someone affronts my values, I will cut him off so quickly that he will just be gone. I will probably never initiate contact with that person again. I will never say anything to hurt him but I will have lost all respect for him as a person.
I‚Äôm an educator of adults. This is my life‚Äôs work and I approach it with a passion. Even after all these years, I still have problems when I have to evaluate projects or papers. If the students have given everything they can, it does not feel right for me to assign grades to their work.
I am like a house with many different rooms. The family rooms are hectic, loud, and full of people. However, the rooms where I prefer to spend most of my time are furnished and decorated to promote tranquility and nurture my spirit. They are very private, and only I am allowed to go there.
I don‚Äôt understand how people can live in conflict with their values.
I could never do something just because someone else wants me to do it if it doesn‚Äôt feel right to me.
I don‚Äôt like my sister. But I love her because she‚Äôs family. Loving my family is an important value to me.

VIGNETTES
Scenes from the world of Introverted Feeling

A woman mentally checked out of an exercise because she knew there would not be enough time for her introverted decision making. She could not do the assignment. Her need to contribute in her own preferred way could not be met while she complied with the group‚Äôs mandate to complete the task. She felt that her only option was to cut herself off from the exercise in order to resolve the inner conflict.
A woman reported that at work, group decision making often moves too fast. It does not allow time for private consideration. It is helpful if information and an agenda are provided in advance of a meeting to give her an opportunity to reflect. Even then it is usually difficult for her to participate in a way that is comfortable unless the discussion is deferred to a later meeting.
When my son was a teenager, I inadvertently violated a deeply held value of his. He would not talk to me for the next two years.
My husband and younger brother both prefer Introverted Feeling. When they served as pallbearers at our mother‚Äôs funeral, they wore flannel shirts and blue jeans. They just knew it was the right way for them to honor her. They had been with her every day and had never dressed or behaved like anyone but themselves for her. They were not going to change that for her funeral just to please others. It did not bother them in the least that most of my aunts and uncles, concerned about what is appropriate and customary, were appalled.

"
1955,isfp,"""Is the only mental process with a truly non-negotiable element""
I'm not sure if I completely agree with the statement. True, there are values I know I cannot negotiate but I also have values that are incomplete, unrefined or in need of a good polish. Fi learns through experience, and values can change with time and experience. So how can it be set in stone? "
1956,isfp,"Wholeheartedly agree. I am constantly re-evaluating and seeking to better understand what I like, what is important to me, what I believe. I don't always know right off the bat, hence the ""seeking"". There are values I have that are ""in development"", so to speak."
1957,isfp,"My ISFP friend loves making art‚Äî painting, drawing, sketching, knitting, crocheting, and sewing.
She also loves animals‚Äî she makes friends with everyone's pets and she adores horse back riding.
She enjoys photograghy‚Äî pictures with her phone and pictures with her camera. Pictures, pictures, pictures.
She loves tv and movies. She will watch anything that isn't scary or dirty. Because she is an ISFP so she is a cinnamon roll."
1958,isfp,"I love art. Drawing, coloring, painting. I love fashion and choosing outfits, doing makeup. Photography is really fun. Decorating my home. I love watching movies. I love learning about subjects I‚Äôm interesting in."
1959,isfp,"I prefer to do things that require a performance (doing exercise, going down a trail with my bike, playing a game physically preferably) anyways i also like to watch films and i'm starting to read, maybe i'll get the habit."
1960,isfp,"I‚Äôm an isfp female (married, Mom of 2, mid 20s)
Long walks alone
Hiking
Listening to audiobooks
Aquarium, museums, and Amusement parks (in that order)
COOKING (my form of artistic expression)
Crafts
DIY home improvements 
Working in yard/garden"
1961,isfp,"Not sure if I'm ISFP or ESFP. One of those. Probably. 
I bounce from activity to activity a lot depending on the day, how I feel, rain, sun, stuff like that. I have the most fun with solo sports, freestyle skateboarding is probably my favorite followed by surfing. I would surf more but it's far to get to any beach. 
I like backpacking a lot. It's a bit expensive for me for long thru hikes but I try to take a month or two a year to do something. 
For lazier days, I'll just hit a coffee shop, read up on a subject I'm into, go on Reddit, practice piano, take a slow hike, apply for cool jobs I'll never get, play a game, fall asleep at a park. I also love film photography and I'll take a camera most places I go. It's something I can sink a ton of time into. 
When hanging with friends, we will generally go to a bar, music show, screw around playing golf, board games. I have a lot of hobbies and I always find more and try new things but never stick long enough to get really good at any. It sucks but also keeps things fun"
1962,isfp,"Well mostly i love lying in my bed doing nothing while i listen to music. But i also love to draw, write in my journal, sing, write songs, play guitar and ukulele, plan outfits, play with make up, cook, play games here and there, watch movies and tv, try out restaurants i havent been to, read graphic novels, watch lets plays. In warm weather i like to go on bike rides on my beautiful red bike or walk my dog. Ooh and also have solo picnics under the shade of a tree-sometimes i bring a bubble machine because it really adds to the atmosphere."
1963,isfp,"i love drawing, sleeping, watching tv, watching youtube, playing the piano, singing, dancing, coloring, playing with my dog, painting,  windowshopping/shopping, playing video games. i used to love cooking and yoga but i don't have the patience most days anymore. i also love golfing but i don't go much because it's expensive for me right now. im not really into photography but if im in a big city i like to go to the top of some building and take beautiful cityscape photos. "
1964,isfp,"I usually just spend my whole day on the internet and sleeping, but when I'm not a lazy mess I like to travel, ski/snowboard, ice skate, play volleyball, do gymnastics stuff, go on boat trips, do something fun with friends, play video games, take pictures, swim.."
1965,isfp,"Well I happen to be good at typing and I can assure you, she's an ISFP.
As described by socionics:
Meaning that ISFPs are good at avoiding bad situations, favouring the good ones. So yeah to be perfectly fair, ISFPs are naturally good at selecting scenarios where something can be gained (among other things). Pushed that principle to the max and you get a gold digger.
Obviously that doesn't mean all ISFPs are gold diggers. It's just a joke but like all jokes there is a little bit of truth. "
1966,isfp,"It's okay to be a little naughty. Nobody is going to tie you on a burning stake for slightly falling into a stereotype. Everyone slightly falls into their own stereotype. But there is a huge difference between having a tendency to follow favouring situations and being a Russian prostitute gold digger over materialist attention whore.
With my most sincere well wishing attentions, it is my duty to suggest you to grow a pair for your own well being and self development. ;)"
1967,isfp,"I know. You guys are often listed as my ‚Äúenemy‚Äù type. For the record, I don‚Äôt believe this. I think you guys are fascinating, intriguing individuals and I always find myself so drawn to you. I love your aloofness, your individuality, and the way your brain thinks. You have this sort of quiet, artistic charisma that makes me want to know what‚Äôs going on in your head. 
  Anyway, all I‚Äôve really seen online is that we are not compatible. I say screw that. But I‚Äôm wondering what do y‚Äôall think of us, the ENTP? "
1968,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and my wife is an ENTP. We have a dynamic, challenging relationship--and I don't mean challenging as a euphemism for unhealthy or dysfunctional. We have very different strengths and ways of doing things and tend to spur each other on to further personal growth. Unfailing mutual love and respect, as well as strong communication skills, are key to making this work, but we couldn't be happier.  
Socially, I find ENTPs some of the most engaging people to listen to, and enjoy their tendency of being able to take any side of an argument or to adopt a position just to be deliberately provocative, as long as this doesn't become too mean-spirited."
1969,isfp,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever personally been friends with or known an ENTP well because I tend to mostly hang out with quieter people, but a lot of my closest friends are INTPs, so I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall are great as well! I especially love XNTP humor and how you all tend to be pretty independent and free thinking. You‚Äôre all pretty cool in my book ;)."
1970,isfp,"I married an ENTP when I was way too young to know any better. After 12 years it ended after her 2nd affair and complete inability to take responsibility for her actions or see anything outside of her ""correct"" way of thinking. Of course, everyone is different, but the NT type in general (at least for me) is okay as a friend/acquaintance but nothing further than that. YMMV"
1971,isfp,"I love entps! We definitely tend to be in different crowds, but I have a lot of respect for how you guys can make anything seem interesting. I‚Äôve never met an entp who wasn‚Äôt charismatic, so that‚Äôs something too."
1972,isfp,I‚Äôm ISFP and my boyfriend is ENTP so... not enemies. I often say I would like to have a holiday in his brain. I can‚Äôt argue without crying and he loves a good argument. Must be nice to not take every single thing personally. I don‚Äôt understand how you guys are so easy-going about all the things. 
1973,isfp,"all I know is screw MBTI compatibility. I'll be damned if I started avoiding other people solely based on their MBTI type ü§∑ I bet some ENTPs can be cool (even if I've met some annoying immature ones before, from my grade school cough)"
1974,isfp,"So, basically, I don‚Äôt think we understand ourselves very well, at least I don‚Äôt. "
1975,isfp,"We're opposites and I would love to see if the compatibility really is all it's cracked up to be. 
Hi there! I'm Jenn, 21 from Iowa. I am a banker, going back to school in August. Going for CPA, masters in accounting, bachelors in finance, double minor in math and econ. I love camping, fishing, backyard games, golf, board games, reading, music, etc.
So tell me about you!
What are your hobbies?
What's your idea of a perfect evening?
What are your goals and aspirations in life?"
1976,isfp,"Gosh. A desk job sounds like the worst thing I could do. I was a Finance Clerk for a while and I hated every minute of it. But good on you for pursuing something.
A fellow I know is and ENTJ and we get along pretty well despite having polar opposite interests and personalities.
I'm not the ""Outdoors"" type, but every now and then I love taking a walk to nowhere in particular to just think. 
Hobbies? Talking to people is by far one of my favourite things to do, the idea of sharing knowledge is a wonderful idea I'm very passionate about. Despite having anxiety (and depression) public speaking is one of my favourite things to do. Next semester I'm taking a Teacher's Assistant course to learn the ropes of teaching and hopefully be one step closer to being a teacher. Playing/writing music and short stories is a fun thing I do every now and then. I, like millions of other people, play the guitar ^^so ^^cool,^right? Other than that, the hobbies aren't anything special, I mostly enjoy just relaxing and soaking in downtime.
A perfect evening is one with nothing to plan or do. I hate planning and I do most everything on-the-fly with little to no preparation and it almost always works out fine. Improvisation on stage usually brings a more organic feel to what I'm saying, so I stick with it.
~Some guy in a Canadian forest"
1977,isfp,"Hey! I'm Alexis, an ISFP, 21, living in Canada. I'm in 2nd year Nursing. And currently working as a health care aide at a mental hospital (I LOVE MY JOB!)
I love music, reading, watching TV shows (seasons at a time) camping, road trips, art/museums etc. 
My idea of a perfect evening would be a quiet date night, going out for sushi, or a fancy coffee shop followed by a long walk and talking about life or music.
Goals in life: to truly understand myself, and achieve happiness :) "
1978,isfp,"Funny, I was looking at a list of the 16 types, picking out which ones I perceived to be the weirdest. Extroverts are weird to me, so are judgers and thinkers. As a result of that, ENTJ's won, and then I realized that without even thinking about it I had picked my polar opposite as weirdest. Haha.
I don't like camping, I'm what you would call 'indoorsy' (unless a friend or two would come along, then it might be bearable). Probably the only reason I hate camping is because my parents were the only ones who were with me. I hate my parents. :/ I helped make a fire in the woods with just some close friends and a couple new ones earlier this year and that was super fun. I'd do that again.
Fishing on a boat in Florida was one of my more fun experiences because I actually caught a few. I still remember standing up on the bow, trailing a line behind me while going about 5-10mph. Sounds slow but it's not. Backyard games, golf, no. Actually, I hate all team sports. Board games, okay. Reading, yes. Music, hell yes. 
Hobbies: I'm an amateur DJ. And I just started collecting vinyl records. That's about it. I love art and decorating too.
Perfect evening: Home alone with a good book, my stereo turned up loud, and enough Coke and vodka to get black-out wasted. Not that I would, I just really like Coke and vodka.
Goals in life? Spending more time with the people I really care about. Like I said, I don't get along with my parents, and I don't have many friends where I live. My true friends live in another state. My ultimate goal is to move there when I'm an adult.
EDIT: I appreciate you reaching out. :) Understanding the differences in the types, accepting that everyone is not the same, and respecting everyone's boundaries (aka not pressuring someone to do something they don't want to) is the key to everyone getting along happily. "
1979,isfp,"That's so cool! I really admire people who are opposites and fall in love anyway. It's so inspiring. (Probably that ISFP reject conformity thing I have haha)
My hobbies are really just chilling out, being able to do whatever I feel like. One minute I want to watch a movie, the next I want to walk in the park or go hang out with friends or go to dinner or travel hahaha it's awful. Because I'm so indecisive it's hard for me to make solid plans and stick to them. 
A perfect evening would be going on a date with my ENFP boyfriend where he would surprise me the whole evening. Like a concert or a picnic, seeing the sunset whatever. I love experiencing things. I like sitting around every other day for a bit to regain my rest and my balance but usually I like to be out doing things and taking the world in. So a perfect evening would be going out to dinner and to a concert or something but eventually coming back home to watch a movie with dessert and my cats on my lap. :) but then  again it varies every day....
As for goals... I want to accomplish contentment in my life. I want to inspire people to do good and express themselves. I want to teach others to be passionate and to love one another. And then I want to create and create some more. I think the world is lacking serious creativity. And I want to learn compassion for everyone. "
1980,isfp,"29yo male ISFP here.  I'm in physician assistant school currently so I don't know how I'd spend an ideal evening yet since life has yet to settle down to a normal level.
I too love camping, enjoy golf, and excelled in math.  Favorite part of the day is driving alone to or from school/work listening to music and drinking my coffee."
1981,isfp,"I used to do improvisational performing but could never consider that much in real life situations. I am a planner through and through. I love a good itinerary haha. 
Teaching huh? I used to tutor children but could never be a teacher. For some reason this reminded me of a game I used to play whenever sitting in a place with heavy foot traffic, I'd try to compliment as many people walking by as possible without them knowing I was doing it to everyone. "
1982,isfp,"I find that I'm very attracted to people who the complete opposite of me! It gives me an interesting insight into how others function. ...Although being introverted means that I can be like ""socially awkward"".... Not so cool :/"
1983,isfp,"It is amazing.  There is so much beauty out there that we can only appreciate if we slow down a bit.  
Here's some audio of the hermit thrush - in my opinion, the most beautiful sounding song. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XndDqY53eD8"
1984,isfp,"I small talk constantly at my job, most of the time of the weather or if something is happening to someone they know like a wedding or what have you. I kind of like small talk, it's relaxing and like chewing gum to me. It just depends on the flavor of the conversation whether I like it really. :) so how is the weather? Here it is hot and humid! Blugh my hair is long, blonde, and curly so the humidity turns me into a lion at times haha. "
1985,isfp,"Awesome table :) Personally I'm not a fan of ""decor for the sake of decor"" (store bought mass produced decorations/cushions) but I'm a bit of a horder when it comes to antiques and sentimental items so I'm in no position to criticize. If they're special things which have meaning to you, then they're great as they are"
1986,isfp,That looks lovely!! Maybe you could introduce one accent color into the mix like a darker/bright purple? A pillow + a wall decoration in something that pops could easily add some flair! I love what you have going already though 
1987,isfp,"Well, I hear that ISFPs traditionally are afraid of speaking their mind when frustrated or confused. I get that a lot unless I am in a situation where I am comfortable, such as at home, at school, or anywhere with friends. In those cases, I tend to have very little restraint and end up saying things that come out sounding a lot meaner than they sounded in my head."
1988,isfp,"I'm not as spontaneous as I hear ISFPs typically are. More specifically, if someone suggests doing something spontaneously, I'm usually down for it, but if plans get changed or canceled, I flip out.
I actually think this is a result of the ways I've developed to cope with my ""SP"", if you will. For instance, I'm a chronic list maker, calendar keeper, etc. Reason being: I will forget what we've planned to do the moment I walk away from you if I didn't write it down. In order to compensate for that, I become what looks like a really organized person, and I guess technically I am, but it's only because I've learned that if I'm unorganized, I ditch people or forget about them or don't get my work done.
So, when other people cancel or need to reschedule on me, I think it's a result of disorganization on their part and I get upset."
1989,isfp,"On the surface I exhibit more ISTP-esque tendencies. I seem serious and logical, with minimal emotion. That's due to 1) Me working hard to control my emotions so as not to be an emotional train wreck; and 2) my Sensing and Thinking functions are decently developed and are my primary Extroverted functions. A type's Introverted functions are internal obviously, and so they're not as easy to spot. Extroverted functions, however, are the first ones you'll notice because they're being projected outward into the open for everyone to observe.
But if I'm comfortable with you and I open up more you'll see I'm actually very emotional. "
1990,isfp,I think I'm more anxious/neurotic than the typical ISFP description of someone who's cool and going with the flow.  I think this is partly my upbringing (I have really anxious parents) and partly my Fi hitting into overdrive.
1991,isfp,"I'm pretty sure to those who don't know me well or only see me in work/academic settings, I might come off like an ISTJ. People have described me as ""responsible"" because if they ask me specifically to do something for them and I agree, I will do it, on time and with every detail in place. This is mostly because I don't want to let anyone down or hurt anyone's feelings rather than any overall sense of duty, though. In reality I don't like responsibility itself, in that I will refuse leadership positions and shy away from projects that could have major consequences for other people. 
Other than that I think most of my non-isfp-like traits can be attributed to Te rearing its head when I'm in stressful situation. I can become an obsessive rule-following taskmaster if there are a lot of problems in a given situation, especially if it involves other people. It's still pretty easy to convince me to go with an out-of-the-box idea, mostly because I would rather not deal with arguing and I can blame the consequences on someone else. But when I'm feeling out of my element I will resort to the official rules and will attempt to get every detail right. 
It is when I am relaxed, don't have any official responsibility, and am feeling comfortable with my environment that I can be my usual weird, spontaneous self. "
1992,isfp,"Okay.
Very very late. 
But I have no close friends. I've got the world's most amazing guy, but all of my friends are his friends that just accepted me into their group. 
I think thats part of where  depression comes from. The need for friends, and being so close to having someone to have a real, personal conversation with, but not close enough. "
1993,isfp,"I love a good debate as long as it's cordial. :) I like sticking to my guns or finding out I was wrong. What I like most about debating is that the whole time you can learn about the other person and their view-- how they got there, what their influences were and others who hold the same view, etc. I hate debates where there is a tension either because the topic is charged or one side is angry, or whatever. "
1994,isfp,"I'm the least neurotic person I know (my Big Five neuroticism score was 7) and I am a live-and-let-live type of person but I can be extremely intolerant of others' bullshit (my agreeableness score was also very low).
On the internet - especially here - I am not afraid to say, ""yeah, no, you're fucking wrong/stupid"" to someone where other commenters are sugarcoating the truth."
1995,isfp,"I totally get this! I was walking through a hallway in my school and amongst the people I saw my friend's shoes, so I went up to her. She asked how I saw her in such a large crowd, so I said,""no one else wears socks like that"". What I really meant was she has very colorful socks that you don't usually see, but she thought I meant she's a fashion disaster!"
1996,isfp,"I get what you mean. I don't like having plans often because I find them constraining, but I always plan ahead of time for things that I believe are really important because I want to make sure that they happen. When plans get cancelled or something, I get pretty distraught. It feels like me spending time with them isn't nearly as important as them spending time with me, and that's always a bummer."
1997,isfp,Naturally I love doing things spontaneously and love being invited along to like a movie within an hour or something at a moment's notice when I'm feeling kind of bored.  At the same time though I've noticed a lot of the time I'm reluctant to commit to something like that without thinking it through a bit first.
1998,isfp,I also make lists all the time because I forget what's going on. I frequently will pick something up and will be unable to recall where - or when - I put it down when I realize I'm not holding it any more 5 minutes later. 
1999,isfp,"AETGRSFSDGBF!
Yes.
I have friends, thank goodness for church and gaming or else I simply wouldn't. I was homeschooled and grew up with plenty of friends, but now we are all at different colleges and the new acquaintances I have made A) can never take the place of the old ones (ISFP loyalty coming to bite me in the butt) and B) I often have a hard time finding classmates who I am actually interested in beyond the classroom who I can make time for.
About a year and a half ago (six months before my friends split for different colleges) I met a group of internet buddies and 2-4 have become fast friends. 2 are the kind I would invite to my wedding, and have had over for breakfast when they have passed through my town.  Having them be internet friends has actually been way better than people in my area. I tend to not even really meet up with IRL friends, but my interbuddies can expect a skype call as soon as they touch their computer at home. ;P
If I didn't have these close relationships I know I would be in a dire state. I actually have a lot of anxiety about losing friendships because I have lost so many over the years. Having that connection is like a key ingredient in my emotional well being. I know it sounds like I'm codependent or something, but knowing that I mean something to someone else and that they know the reverse is true is something I need."
2000,isfp,"like  a lot of people, I don't know what descriptions mean when they talk  about ""living in the moment"" and ""aware of the environment"", but I saw a lot of ISFPs and a couple of INFPs to differentiate between them, and I  noticed that:
‚Äã
ISFPs usually are into certain physical activities. They are the ones who are more likely to enjoy  exercising manual skills. things like art crafts, mechanical repairing  of something, cutting hair, etc. Not only ISFPs, but also my ISTP  brother is better than me at drawing, although he never practiced and I  do it for years.
‚Äã
According  to what I saw: ISFPs tend to be inclined to the more artistic side of  manual skills, like (painting, drawing, singing) while ISTPs tend to go  towards the ""puzzle side"" of manual skills, something you can ""solve"",  like building a chair, repairing a computer, fixing a clock, etc.
‚Äã
But, there are common territories to ISFPs and ISTPs. That is, they have some manual ability potential:  I know a lot of ISFPs and a some ISTPs. An ISFP friend of mine is good  repairing his bike and knows a lot of it. an ISTP acquaintance is  studying painting. Maybe it's not that they have skill, but that they are more interested in those activities. So they become better at some point.
‚Äã
Now, what I could see about INFPs and ISFPs in real life give me some hints. This can be subjective and insufficient.  I have little experience gathered, but what I see is that INFPs seem  more inclined to the SP instinctual variant, while ISFPs tend to be more  open to the people, talks, world. Honestly, INFPs I know may look a  little like INTJs, they could even look like thinkers at first glance,  while ISFPs may look warmer, less distant, and less quiet. Remember that  this is only my subjetive opinion, based on what little I saw.
‚Äã
Another  thing I would like to say. INFPs and ISFPs can look really good if they  can choose what to wear. But there is a thin and not always clear  dividing line. The difference may be that, ISTPs and ISFPs may have some  more ""visual power"". That is to say that they might look good for  aesthetics. The problem here is that Fi ruins this claim. Fi may have  its own fashion. ISFPs may look aesthetically bad if they want to get  it. Let's say that, ISFPs can look better and worse than INFPs can. It  depends on what the ISFP want to transmit.
‚Äã
Instead, INFPs may seem like a little more indifferent to clothes. Male INFPs are more prone to ""wear so you do not go naked"" style (my personal and patented style ‚Ñ¢). Both can wear the same. just an example: while ISFPs wear cyberpunk because ""I look good, I'm brave, cool"", INFP wear cyberpunk becase ""I come from a war, I narrate what I am inside with my clothes"". and that's why ISFPs may vary more the clothes they wear. I have an ISFP acquaintance that always looks well. one day she looks like a hippie, the other day like a cyberpunk, the other day she wears very formal.
‚Äã
and  also, in art, ISFPs tend to make art going more to the aesthetic. what  it mean? they are the ones who are more likely to have ""cool drawings""  about monsters or insects or beautiful persons, and things like that.  they are more capable to appreciate the visual thing as something  complete in itself. While INFPs usually support their ideas in sensory  ways. I myself see drawing as a mean to convey an idea. I see it as an  accessory, not as the main thing of my creation.
‚Äã
I  would never dedicate myself to draw a 1 hour drawing just to finish  with a ""cool drawing"" that doesn't tell anything, or that doesn't  represents anything about me. but I saw many ISFPs that draw much more  beautiful things than mine, with better technique, and much better than  mine, without another message that ""I am a cute drawing"".
‚Äã
comparing  myself INFP with an ISFP friend. We both study visual arts. My drawings  have a narrative context that manifests itself visually. I narrate a  little story about someone or something. I get involved with internal  questions and philosophical doubts. When my ISFP friend want's to give a  meaning to his drawings, he usually takes a metaphor of some of the  songs he likes and draws it. If the song is called ""the shadows that  drown me"", he draw a shadow drowning someone. And he does it well.
‚Äã
‚Äã
Fredrikhellstorm added:
In  my experience Isfps seem to be really talented visually, while not as  much when it comes to language. While Infps like me seem to be the other  way around. For example the two Isfps I know closest (and who I  actually dare to type) are both super talented in art. Interestingly one  makes art in 3d animation software, and the other one designs  furniture. Both things that probably requires great spatial skills. For  me though (and now I‚Äôm speaking mostly from my personal perspective) I  really do suck at drawing. I can‚Äôt get proportions right, and depth is  lacking. However I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm gifted in language. At the same time  one of the isfps I know has dyslexia. Not true for the other one, but  he doesn‚Äôt really seem to have an affinity for grammatics either.
‚Äã
I  could go on with this, but it‚Äôs mostly speculation. Really interesting  though, since there‚Äôs such a common stereotype of isfps as typical  artists, while there‚Äôs quite many famous infp writers to name.
‚Äã
Anyway, a theory of mine. I shouldn‚Äôt be writing stuff like this at 3 am. But I do like writing lol...
‚Äã

‚Äã
What's your opinion?"
2001,isfp,"I like what you said about the way infps and isfps look at style, you pretty much nailed it. My sister is infp and her clothing has always been an intense deliberate statement about who she is inside and my clothes have always been more of a ""these blue boots are going with this general aesthetic I'm going for today"" type of thing. 
What with her being infp and me being isfp I've thought a lot about the differences in the way we make art. We both draw, write music, and sing but our approaches are way different what I've kinda noticed it boils down to is this. Infp art is idea driven and isfp art is sensory driven. Which is NOT to say isfp art has no deeper meaning. It's just that For infps the concept and idea happens first. in my sister's case she has a lot of characters and an entire universe where they live in her mind and the act of drawing is the tools to create to those ideas. For me it's the reverse. The sensational act of drawing, painting, etc is the driving force and appeal for me and in doing that meaning and ideas emerge secondairily, almost subconciously. In our song writing too I notice the same things happen. For me the melodies and sensory sound of the song always come first and I sing nonsense words nailing down the tune of the song first and patching together lyrics after the tunes done. I figure out what the songs about later. For my sister she generally has ideas and things she wants to say before she writes her songs and and the idea carries out how the songs going to sound. 
Other differences are 
my ideas are often about colors and aesthetic/look/feel I want to acheive. Sensory actions I want to try. Her ideas relate to her characters/ stories. She's a writer and stuff. 
Also I'm way more into varieties of mediums and textures and visual sensations and crafting and t She tends to stick to paper and pens and making videos and animations. Things to propel stories.
As a disclaimer this is just based on my observations and speculations. "
2002,isfp,"dancing, sewing, playing instruments, writing, running, rambling, relaxing, daydreaming, etc. dunno - latest effort"
2003,isfp,"This is a really interesting post, and I find that I relate more to the INFP description, in that I essentially use aesthetics to convey meaning, not the other way around. For instance, in writing I implement a lot of sensory descriptions, but not to sheerly write beautiful words on a page, but to create an underlying meaning. For me, everything is inherently symbolic. However, I would say my poetry  is a lot less cerebral and easy to follow than the OP, and more detailed, which could point to Se. It is filled with metaphors and abstractions, yes, but I feel like the meanings could be interpreted much more simply. Or maybe that could just be because I wrote the poem myself, so it‚Äôs easy for me to understand.
Since I am a young writer who is incredibly vulnerable to criticism, I am a little nervous about sharing my poems on an online platform, especially because they are the basic essence of my heart and soul. However, I would be willing to share them for your opinions. A lot of what is symbolic may not come across as symbolic at first glance, but if I explain, would you be willing to share your thoughts? It‚Äôs funny, sometimes I see that Se lends itself to being more straightforward and succinct, but then in cases like these, it is considered more detailed? Or am I just confused? 
I don‚Äôt relate at all to preferring actions over words. I need words to express myself, otherwise I cannot truly express the core of who I am.
Maybe I am just confused because I use more Si than Ne? I notice, especially recently, that I am constantly reminiscing over past memories, relating the past to the present, and stuck on bad memories. But I also read that Se could lead to a strong memory too. I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes, MBTI just seems like a black and white system trying to explain human behavior that is so dynamic and expansive, like trying to fit the entire ocean into a river. It‚Äôs overwhelming, but intriguing. "
2004,isfp,Me? I am no poetry expert. I really don‚Äôt know much about it at all honestly. I agree that you‚Äôre INFP. Perhaps another Ne type could be more helpful?
2005,isfp,"When it comes to writing and self-expression, I do feel like I am an INFP. My words and intuition flow into a world of abstractions, metaphors, and thoughts, and I find that I share the same innate passion for writing that many INFPs describe. However, I am not always daydreaming in my fantasy worlds. I find (especially recently) that I am focusing on past events that have happened in my real life, constantly relating my present to my past memories. Maybe I'm just developing my Si? I think that when I allow myself to drift off and just enjoy the beauty of my thoughts, letting each one dance and dissolve into its natural train of ideas, I then get lost in my imagination. But it's less common than my focus on the past.
I actually thought I could be ISFP because when I think about focusing on my surroundings, I can notice all the sounds and textures in my environment. But I only do this when I'm actually aware of my environment, usually when I'm contemplating if I do use Se.
Thanks for your input :) I suppose I probably do use Ne then, even though I have been told that some of my thoughts come across as Ni, even though I don't really relate to the idea of Ni. MBTI is exhausting when you constantly think about it, but it's thrilling too. I'm glad that it's helping me to learn more about myself along the way.
I'll be sure to analyze the other Ne types, but I have never so deeply related to a type other than INFp."
2006,isfp,"Si is probably the function I know least about but yeah, dwelling on the past sounds like that could be it.
Se is immersed in our present environment in an almost subconscious way and it‚Äôs not really like this at all:
Se isn‚Äôt just being aware of your surroundings. I feel that is a gross misunderstanding of the function perpetuated by types who don‚Äôt really use it (and it‚Äôs not your fault for misunderstanding either, since those types are typically the ones writing MBTI descriptions online.)
It‚Äôs being in tune with your surroundings. Depending on how much you‚Äôve developed Se, it can manifest as quick reflexes, grace, physical dexterity, and artistic talents.
I live with at least three (maybe four) other SPs (which means we either lead with Se or have it as our auxiliary function) and here are some examples I might see on a daily basis of Se in action:


ESTP kindergartener walks into my (pretty cluttered and messy) bedroom and immediately notices small, minute detail that had changed since the last time he was in there. He basically notices everything, always. Also, if an ESxP ever drives you somewhere once, odds are they‚Äôll be able to do it again with relative ease, no matter how many twists and turns. 


cat or baby knocks something off table/shelf/counter and ISTP will casually catch it while walking by or leaning forward in his chair.


I walk outside to call my kids in for dinner, hear  someone yell ‚ÄúHeadache!‚Äù, and instinctively know to catch the football ISTP has thrown at my face.


take my kids skating for the first time in their lives and before we go home my ISFP daughter is doing the limbo and the macarena and dancing - really well - on skates.


There‚Äôs an expectation of environmental awareness and little tolerance for clumsiness in our home. We throw things to each other. We get annoyed when people are klutzy or don‚Äôt make eye contact or seem to not be paying attention. I don‚Äôt know if these things apply to sensors in general, or mostly just Se, but I definitely don‚Äôt relate to INFPs in this regard.
Also Se problem areas that are pretty easy to spot include bad tempers and unchecked egos. ISxPs hide this better than ESxPs but it lurks beneath the surface. Ever punched a hole in a wall? Flipped a table? I‚Äôve seen that behavior in unhealthy Se users. 
I do not really understand Si or Ne well enough to delve into those. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2007,isfp,"Thanks for your thorough explanation about Se! It's very interesting how your family has such a close and inherent relationship with your environment. I have horrible coordination, and I wish I could have as much grace as you and your family in action. I'm especially envious of your daughter because when I was in elementary school, I struggled for hours to learn how to skate, and I only succeeded in acquainting my bottom with the ice, to the point where they had become quite good friends :D
I find it interesting about your point about Se aggression because when I was little (around five or six), I actually broke our front door in anger. I have grown so much as a person since then, and I don't even recognize myself when I think about my childhood, but maybe that could be a sign of Se? Although, anger issues are rooted deeply in family-my dad, who I suspect could be an ENTP, has a horrible habit of violently smashing his computer when anger floods over him. So, this very much could be a genetic issue. I rarely ever react physically to frustration now. Instead, I usually break down into tears and withdraw into my own world. 
I would guess that I am a Ne user, then, based on your descriptions. Since birth, I seem to have missed out the ability to catch balls, but my extremely athletic brother is helping me to develop that skill by occasionally throwing a tennis ball to me, so I am slowly but surely improving :) 
Oh, I also just remembered one of my favorite moments in Anne of Green Gables when Anne, the main character (who is commonly typed as an INFP) smashes a slate on a boy's head when he teased her. So, sometimes behavior could simply over-step the boundaries of MBTI."
2008,isfp,"Hmmm. Yeah, your answer makes me think that the rage issues are just environmental behaviors we pick from our family and not necessarily an Se thing after all.
I guess I just assumed they were because most Se users I know have them."
2009,isfp,"Definitely :) I don't believe that a system can truly explain all the complexities of human life. We are far more dynamic than a set of systems, and there are a number of factors and possibilities that combine to frame the foundations of who we are. Ancestry, the past, or life-changing events shape the integral parts of who we are. It's one of the reasons that MBTI frustrates me, because it can seem so rigid without considering all the thousands of perspectives to be explored."
2010,isfp,"Hi, again! 
So, I really don't like stereotyping anyone, but everytime I look for ""isfp guys approaching a girl"" I only read about this type being shy and stuff. My question is: how are isfps when they like a girl? Are all shy? I would really apreciate the answers ;))"
2011,isfp,"When ISFPs like someone, they run away. It's a good mix of wanting to engage with you and talk to you so you notice them, and then running off when you respond/before you can respond because of their shyness. They usually wait for your interest to make the first move. Make sure your ISFP KNOWS you're interested and not just being your friendly and nice self."
2012,isfp,"I don't really consider myself shy, just cautious about what I do. In regards to people I like, I'll typically wait until I've been provided evidence to support the idea that they like me. Reserved I feel is a better word for me as an ISFP, but we're all different.
And like u/supportivepistachio said, it is a good mix of wanting to engage and waiting for you to make the first move. "
2013,isfp,"I would never talk first to a girl if I was interested (or at all lol), unless maybe if I felt something REALLY special,  but even then I don't think I would, they would have to take the first step.
as I've grown up I've become a little bit more extroverted,  but only after I've detailed/considered/whatever word goes well my environment. I can't just walk into a room and have a conversation,  unless I knew u could jet out and not see anyone again before I inevitably hit awkwardness. if there are dominant social people in my environment,  I won't talk at all, not any. if there are other shy people, I can sometimes be a little more extrovert, whereas when I was younger, was full introvert."
2014,isfp,"(A DAE thing) One thing I've noticed that consistently comes up, is that I'm absolutely terrible at explaining things to others, nearly everything including the things I do and myself. It often leads to awkward situations as I stumble over my words. I feel like I have a head full of thoughts but I'm the worst at bringing them out. Are we ISFPs bad at explaining things? (Also, does this make you feel isolated at times?)"
2015,isfp,I‚Äôm an ISFP and the same. I can never articulate clearly what I feel and/or think in a moment. I can only really do it after I‚Äôve had time to reflect on whatever point/feeling I‚Äôm trying to get across... and it‚Äôs usually too late by that point haha. 
2016,isfp,"im great at explaining in writing. ive always aced english classes and even speeches and stuff. But when it comes to something like- for example, passing important info off about the details of a situation with a customer to another co worker i stumble, stutter, throw out useless details, say stuff in non chronological order etc. Any time pressure tends to make me a horrible communicator."
2017,isfp,"If I‚Äôm feeling confident I‚Äôm good with words. When I feel insecure, fuckkkk no. 
My pet peeve is when somebody takes way too long to explain something. I feel like I automatically condense my thoughts so I don‚Äôt go on and on explaining something."
2018,isfp,"I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:
Did you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?"
2019,isfp,"I cheated with my long term girlfriend and struggled almost every day to tell her about it. But the longed I waited, the more I know it would hurt her and was scared she would leave me. We broke up almost year ago because of diffrent reasons. To this day she does not know. I learned my lesson and will never do that again..."
2020,isfp,"I've never cheated, but have been cheated on. It's been such a painful thing to have to deal with: my sense of worth/confidence was shattered for a long time. I also have trust issues because of it. For this reason, I've vowed to never inflict that pain upon anyone else. "
2021,isfp,"About a month into my current relationship. Had an ex drunkenly contact/flirt with me. Slightly tempted, but resisted. I'm way too happy where I am to risk it for a one-night stand. Don't want to do that to myself or my SO."
2022,isfp,"I have only ""cheated"" when I have made up my mind the previous relationship is over. Ex: dated a guy for 8 months, decided I wanted to end things but I was going on a trip and wanted to wait until I got home to end it in person. Ended up kissing someone I met on the trip and ended things with current boyfriend when I got back."
2023,isfp,"
I'm putting together a racing bike! In the process I had to part with my current bike. I will miss it greatly. However, I think the buyer of the old bike was the absolute best candidate I could have selected - he had a full-on Se-gasm as he tested it. ""This is perfect! I love it! It feels just like my old one!!""
I'm now FB friends with one of my university professors. It feels strange. I've never gone as far as adding professors as FB friends before. (INFJ?)
I think I'm inherently attracted to INFJs. Or they to me. In any case, r/infj is not the place to be. Too condescending towards ""those sensors,"" where the INFJs I've known in the real world would never have that kind of attitude.
I don't think he's an ISFP, but one of my idols died recently. I suppose his music is now the soundtrack to this thread.
I quit my supermarket job of six years. Goodbye asshole INTJ meat manager (your being a fellow cyclist doesn't make up for how much of a prick you are). Goodbye asshole ESTJ store manager (who looked like Senator Armstrong). I don't think I'll ever work in a supermarket again.

Your turn. 3-2-1-grow"
2024,isfp,"About a month ago, I got a job at certain popular fast food chain. I love it. I have to interact with easily over 100 different people a day, not including my coworkers, so it's definitely helping me build my 'people skills'. I'm on a first name basis with all my coworkers, including the managers. They're like a second family to me."
2025,isfp,"While I like cats, I much prefer dogs. I find that I understand them better. When cats come up to me I don't know what they want and the process of figuring out how they like to be pet is sometimes hard for me (I don't like the rejection). Dogs are always happy to see you, love a good pet and rub and you feel like they're immediately your friend. "
2026,isfp,"I think I like cats. But then they are stubborn, independent and don‚Äôt listen so they frustrate me. And then they get mad at me and act snooty so I‚Äôm just done. Then I‚Äôm like ‚Äúdogs aren‚Äôt that bad!‚Äù But then I realize dogs are annoying.. but I do prefer them over cats. They are always willing to give you a million chances. My mood is always up and down and dogs are ALWAYS there no matter what. They just want to make you happy and they may be annoying but they are such loving creatures. "
2027,isfp,"Personally I like both, but cats are much more my kind of animals. I like their independence compared to dogs. Cats will do what they want, when they want. I might also like them more since I can kind of relate to this behavior. "
2028,isfp,i'm definitely a dog person. i love cats for sure but i feel like i can bond with dogs on a much deeper level than i have with cats. i think it's because i have an easier time feeling the love dogs give because of their smiles and body language whereas with cats it's more difficult for me to understand their moods since their behavior isn't as obvious most of the time. 
2029,isfp,"I'm in the middle, there are good cats, bad cats, good dogs, bad dogs, pretty cats, ugly cats, pretty dogs and ugly dogs. However, I'm rather lazy and don't really go outside much so as a pet dogs aren't really that practical for me. I prefer a calm, independent cat."
2030,isfp,Cats aren't as needy. Dogs are fun to hike with and play with and stuff but generally I prefer the low maintenance aspect of a cat. If I need to be gone all day or for a couple days its not an issue for them as they're so solitary anyways. I appreciate the independence. Ive had quite a few cats over the years and I think people underestimate their intelligence. Emotional and otherwise. For example I have an 8 year old tabby cat female who has learned to come to me when I'm sad or crying. She comforts me and is very gentle in contrast to when she just wants attention from me on a normal occasion and can be brash and demanding. Before I had cats I had no idea they could be loving in this way similar to a dog. This same cat also plays fetch and is very vocal and communicative. I really just find cats fascinating. The wild and the domestic ones. 
2031,isfp,"I like dogs because they are cute. But I wouldn't own one because I would go insane worrying about it all the time. I prefer cats because their personalities are similar to my own. Cats are chill, loving, and smarter than most dogs. My father's dog goes outside and eats the dirt that smells the strongest. Plus cats are very easy to care for. "
2032,isfp,"I do like dogs, my friend‚Äôs sister brought her puppy over yesterday and I fell in love (little lab puppy, I want).
But I REALLY love cats. Maybe it‚Äôs because I never really had dogs, but I‚Äôve had cats almost my whole life so I understand their behavior etc.
That and cats are just ‚Äúcuter‚Äù, imo. 
Small fuzzy things are life.
Shit, my friend‚Äôs cat is evil and always attacks me and I have to carry a water sprayer around whenever I‚Äôm over, yet I still love the little pos. "
2033,isfp,"I love both but I would definitely consider myself a cat person. I currently have three. They're sweet, loving and more low maintenance. I also grew up with cats so I thinks that's probably a big reason I prefer them. I love other people's dogs but I don't think I'm capable of having my own ATM. Personally I don't have the energy or focus to train a dog properly and I feel like I would be doing it a disservice if I got one. I would like to get one eventually though. "
2034,isfp,"Ooooooh yes! I have my ""me"" personality and I'll never shy away from that, but I definitely find myself altering the things I say or my actions based on what I know the other person will respond to best. "
2035,isfp,"I definitely think so! It's like a sign of our opposing Fe, right? There's definitely a sense of accommodating to what others want socially, especially in the beginning stages of getting to know that person. Unfortunately, I feel like it can get us in trouble because we might not be the best at it/end up repressing how we feel or what we want out of the social interaction or relationship with that person."
2036,isfp,"I retook the test a few days ago because I felt like there were a few things that weren't clicking with the INFJ. So I answered as honestly as possible, where as previously when taking the MBTI I guess I'd answered a little more idealistically. "
2037,isfp,"I'd like to ask you some questions.

What was your very first result from an MBTI test (even 16p, if that's the case)?
When you learned about the INFJ profile, what was your reaction?
At that point, had you already joined MBTI communities?
Did your knowledge about INFJs (cognitive functions included) influence your behavior and perspectives? 
You used to think you use Fe, now you think you have Fi; what are the main points that explain this misunderstanding, except the one mentioned in the OP?
Before taking the test two days ago, did you compare yourself with other INFJs on the web/irl? If so, did you think you were quite different?
What pushed you to answer the questions ""less idealistically""?
"
2038,isfp,"

I‚Äôve taken the test twice using 16p ‚Äì the first being INFJ. 


I was very excited as I read up on what being an INFJ meant/ common behaviours etc. I thought I‚Äôd found my people. There were a few things that I was a bit like mmm, I guess that applies, but not really. E.g. Things that ran true ‚Äì Creative, altruistic. Things that weren‚Äôt quite on the money ‚Äì Insightfulness, decisiveness, willpower. 


I had joined a number of INFJ communities, and made online friends with a couple of INFJ‚Äôs.


Definitely. I felt like I then had to live up to the standard of my personality, and always be compassionate/ for the people sort of thing.


Lack of understanding of the difference between FE and FI. Being FI to me was about feeling the emotions of those around and wanting to help when I can, and yes I am like this, but having talked with other INFJ‚Äôs I realised I wasn‚Äôt as inclined to it as they were, I‚Äôve always strived to be this good samaritan, but if you look at me from a realistic stand point I can be like this when I want to, but there are definitely times when I can be a little more selfish. Fi‚Äôs also tend to deal with problems on their own ‚Äì which spoke true to me I was like YESSS, but in actuality I have to express it whether its creatively or needing the comfort/ reassurance of others.  There‚Äôs a really good YouTube video I watched yesterday of 2 Australian Colleagues one whom was INFJ and the other ISFP, and they compare stereotypes of the two personalities. This really solidified that I‚Äôm more ISFP than INFJ ‚Äì the two personality types are apparently very commonly confused. The few stereotypes that the guy (who is the ISFP) thinks are relevant to his personality but are actually INFJ traits were things that I also thought were relevant to me; explaining how I could have easily confused myself as an INFJ‚Ä¶. If that makes sense.


Yes I had compared myself with other INFJ‚Äôs, there were a number of similarities, but the things that we didn‚Äôt have in common stood out. 


My boyfriend is a psychologist‚Ä¶ even though he doesn‚Äôt agree with the MBTI (long story) I‚Äôd been having a lot of troubles lately with my personal life that we‚Äôd been trying to work on. And we talked about how my view of myself as a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù ‚Äì in my mind is much higher than in reality. He‚Äôd made me do a psychology analysis test to prove this (can‚Äôt think of what it was called off the top of my head). And it just got me thinking, so I decided to be more critical of myself, and with the questions asked in the MBTI I spent a lot of time thinking about examples of situations and how I‚Äôd behaved, whereas earlier I was always like ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm always doing that‚Äù and not really looking into it properly.

"
2039,isfp,"I'm just curious. I haven't read anything about bubbly ISFPs. I don't know any ISFP in my life...People around me always consider me as bubbly, even though, so I sort of just accepted it. However, I do have a feeling that it's the type of people I hang out with. For example, my SO is INTJ (exact opposite except for the I).
To elaborate, I'm not cheerleader-bubbly at all. I'm a bit more socially awkward, but I'm more of a...adventurous, always-up-for-trying-something-new...kind of lady, and I like making talk and greeting people meet just to try to get them to smile. If it's awkward, then I just shrink back and carry on...
(sorry for the typo in the title :( )"
2040,isfp,"So fun! My so is an intj as well, her and I get along like peas and carrots. One of the best personality mixes I've known(isfp, intj). As an isfp I'm zen and quiet most the time unless I'm in a creative space or a great conversation then I put out more energy. My so is better suited for social situations than myself but we make a great team. "
2041,isfp,"People describe me as being very bubbly. However, I think I only come across as bubbly when I put in effort in making a good first impression or if I feel comfortable around you. Or if I'm really excited about something then I get overly bubbly. Otherwise, I'm shy and awkward as fck üôà "
2042,isfp,"It is I, your humble Ti dom once again. I read a post on this sub once, where someone pointed out the reason that this place is slow. That reason being, ISFPs for the most part would rather comment or add something to an already existing conversation, rather than starting one. Therefore I have taken it upon myself to post here, and ask you all kinds of silly questions. Feel free to get completely sidetracked in the comments. As for this post, I've been wondering, what kinds of Enneagram types are on this sub? http://pstypes.blogspot.com/2009/08/duniho-enneagram-test-brought-back-to.html
Lol ""humble Ti dom"" is an oxymoron"

2044,isfp,"Ahahah, that gave me a weird little mess.
I had 12 in 2, 11 in 3, 4, and 9, and 10 in 4 and 5, with small scores in 1, 3, and 6.
It said that means I'm probably a type 2, but given the confusing results of that I think I'd have to research more enneagram to type myself."

2046,isfp,"Can be dominating when very aroused. Submissive when you want to be dominated. Neutral when your mind is occupied or you're sleepy. It depends on how comfortable you are with the person you're with, and their preferred role as well. "
2047,isfp,"I find it kind of ironic everyone in this thread is judging ""judgmental people""... 
This is a loaded question. We form judgments about everything automatically. It's not like you can just shut off your cognitive function. I think that I'm somewhat justified in judging some things based on what I glean from using my senses. We have strong awareness of our surrounding because we judge everything... It's how we form opinions.
You can try to ""overcome"" your judgments of people, but you still have them. The very fact that you recognize that you don't want to judge that person means you have an opinion about why. 
Judgement is used with a negative connotation but it really shouldn't be. And we as ISFP's should be the most likely to defend that notion in my opinion since its our dominant function. "
2048,isfp,"It makes my skin crawl. I'm the kind of person who tries to be nice to everyone, particularly the people who others typically don't like or talk badly about.
However, if I'm being completely honest, I can be incredibly judgmental myself, but not to specific people, I'm more kind of generally snooty about specific kinds of people. Example: I used to work at Barnes and Noble, and I was very high and mighty about the fact that I was better than the kinds of people who bought books just because Oprah recommended them. However, in my workplace, when someone is gossiped about a lot, I try to stand up for them whenever I can, and I think poorly of people who gossip about others frequently."
2049,isfp,"People who are quick to judge others really rub me the wrong way. It just seems like a hateful way to go through life, you know? I used to be extremely judgmental until one year at camp, my initial, negative judgements about people were proven wrong over and over. After that I stopped doing it. I just hope those who are judging haven't experienced something like that and hope that they will soon. "
2050,isfp,"play/watch soccer (atm with all the summer competitions) photography,  play violin(not so much anymore)/play guitar (not so much either because I don't have a teacher and not enough motivation or knowledge to learn myself) waist time browsing the internet, think about how I could make my life better, not do those things, also before I fall asleep I like to recount everything embarrassing or stupid I've done, procrastinate (serious for the first half, kinda serious about the rest, please have mercy on me)"
2051,isfp,"Play disc golf, play video games (less now than when I was younger), watch sports (nfl, soccer, nba, ncaa, hockey...pretty much any sport besides tennis), cook, listen to music, go on walks, browse reddit, anything to pass the time..."
2052,isfp,"This is me! I can never finish writing a song though, but I have a bunch of beginnings and choruses saved on my phone haha. How do you go about writing them? 
Also, what kind of documentaries do you watch? I'm always trying to find something interesting to check out."

(had to upload this just to show :P)
Hahaa glad you asked. I like making/playing dance music and wish to make it something I can do for a living which is still a bit far fetched but I've seen if your passionate enough about something and put your time and effort in it, good things will happen =)
It's been a serious hobby of mine for a little while now. 
I also like skateboarding. I used to do that when I was in my teens, but now I've picked it up again and it's so refreshing as I have no pressure to compete or be ""the best"". Physical activities just cleanse your thoughts pretty well if you spend too much time in your own head. 
I also love movies, literature and visual arts. But sound is what moves me the most.
May I ask, what do you do for a living? I've heard that ISFP's have a hard time to find a line of work that resonates with ones core values. "
2054,isfp,"I wish I could play more, my teacher quit teaching (as a side effect of a long story) after she had taught me for about a year, I know how to play the few songs I memorized but can't read sheet music anymore. I can however read sheat music for violin although I havent taken lessons/actively practiced in 2-3years, my problem was knowing how to read music for violin but the two are different so it messed me up every time I switched between the two, anyway thank you for letting me talk about myself "
2055,isfp,"I can email some rough demos that i have. But i know alot of people hate autotune in the world. I love it, i dont need it and i wont use it forever but it just sounds so cool so im using it alot. So if you dont mind that then sure"
2056,isfp,"Hi. About writing songs, I usually write little poems and then structure them into songs with the instrumentation in my head until i can put them in real life, those songs are my most prized ones. Or write a song on a beat off youtube. Which i hate but it helps pop sensibilities by letting the beats guide the song. I usually try to write a song a day or i go into withdrawals.
About art docs. Idk i just look up art related stuff and then go on a youtube related video sidebar adventure. My favorite artists are takashi murakami, francis bacon, andy warhol, picasso of course. Some contemporary art even though it makes me look pretentious and stuff but i think some of it is very nice. Just look up a doc on modern art and some artists interviews and go from there. "
2057,isfp,"Whole heartedly agree with physical activities. There is just something about expending our conserved energy that makes one feel good! I really like dance music too, even if I don't go out dancing,but bust a move in my room is always fun. 
Right now,for work, I'm doing manual labor. A friend of mine has his own business doing everything from lawn care, landscaping, to ""dirt work"" to painting decks to painting murals. Home remodels,what have you: he does. So it's cool seeing how everything goes together and its great having someone you work with have the same value system pretty much. 
It isn't something I want to do, but after doing it (and having all this energy expended all the time) it is hard for me to want to do something less hard  (physically).  I feel called to be a minister, so I'm on the path to that. I love people and being a support for them, just being able to help someone do anything, yaknow? 
How much time are you putting into your dream? How much free/spair time is being wasted? And who are you (who/what do you claim to be)?"
2058,isfp,"Try learning how to read tabs, when I started to play guitar I had the same kind of issue with sheet music (oddly enough I too learned violin first), but tabs are really easy. They show you fret numbers and strings instead of standard music notes."
2059,isfp,See that's where I have the hardest part to making songs. I don't know how to fully play any instruments yet so it's hard for me to really fill the song out to my expectations. I never thought to find an instrumental on youtube though.
2060,isfp,"I try to put as much as I can into producing and dj'ing. I don't have a ""real"" job at the moment so it helps with the creative output, but now I can't put any money on equipment and promo. Producing music is something I want to do for as long as possible and get better at."
2061,isfp,"You open the software, spend some doing absolutely horrendeous music and laugh at it. Then you learn the software in a year or so and start to lose your grip on actually creating stuff and the amount of virtual instruments and effects overwhelms you.
If you can get past that, then you might actually create something :D"
2062,isfp,"Me neither. just imagine the sounds and sing the words in your voice memo so you can remember said sounds, or start producing or keep learning how to play an instrument. 
Or you can direct producers/ musicians which is what i want to do, i suck at being attentive enough to fully produce a song but if i can just co produce and then tell the other musicians/producers what i want according to their strengths and my vision we can work together to make the best art stuff we can ya know. If you have a producer friend or a musician friend ask them for help. "
2063,isfp,They will probably eventually stop having negative feelings but they won‚Äôt forget it. They might put up boundaries so that they don‚Äôt get hurt again. Like they might not want to be as close with you. But I think if you really sit down and apologize they will forgive you. But I don‚Äôt know this person so nothing I say is for sure. 
2064,isfp,"With a lot of mindfulness about my own feelings, I have stopped harboring anger at people and accepted their past actions. But at this best stage, I don't care about them and I wouldn't trust them again.
‚Äã
I think your best theoretical shot would be to apologize upfront and consistently do caring things/send thoughtful words to the ISFP without expecting anything in return. Be ready to listen when they explode at you with the list of things you did wrong. Repeat unless they tell you to back off."
2065,isfp,"This has been said already but I would forgive and not forget. They'll probably start acting normal pretty quickly but it may or may not be brought up again later, and may or may not change their opinions of you (at least temporarily)"
2066,isfp,"If they are genuinely sorry, aka they won't do it again and I see the next step they are taking or the step they already took then sure.
Then I will forgive and forget
Most of the small stuff I just say don't do it again though, apologies are for the bigger stuff"
2067,isfp,I‚Äôm sorry man. If things don‚Äôt work out see it as room for your own personal growth‚ÄîIt‚Äôs the easiest way to deal with stuff. You still have all the other people in your life who care about you a lot and think of the people who will become important to you in the future. Don‚Äôt let yourself get too caught up on this. Everything will get better with time. <3
2068,isfp,i made anon accounts giving out to him because i heard he done something by people that really hurt me alot. i figured it wasn't him and confessed and apologised. he understands. but then I did something similar again and I feel so bad he said hes thinkd it will happen again and needs space. i felt do bad I gave him a present of art supplies and ran away. he said he appreciates it but i didn't need to. he's nice to me now in school but still

2070,isfp,"Any post anywhere about an ISFP usually begins by detailing how creative we are. How we have a keen eye for art and are experts at creating masterpieces. However, I have never considered myself an artsy person. My favorite subject in school was not literature (in fact English was my least favorite), and my best drawings feature stick figures. I can appreciate good art but I don't enjoy producing my own work nor do I believe I'm any good at it. Any ISFPs relate? "
2071,isfp,"I can relate! I'm a stick figure Picasso, but any more than that and I'm trash at drawing. However, I do enjoy learning Langauges, English included. Like you though, I can appreciate good art and nature around me. Glad to know I'm not alone either! "
2072,isfp,"Isfp are called artists cause we enjoy using our senses externally. I'm an artist but I've always been naturally good at sports and games as I have great hand and eye coordination. 
So if you also enjoy using your hands, eyes, nose, and ears, youre also using your isfp traits in your life. "
2073,isfp,"Yeah I can't draw for shit and I don't really get art. But I do love Literature, I'm currently studying it at University actually. I'm also learning how to code on my own so yeah, forget what other people think. Do whatever makes you happy. "
2074,isfp,"My ""art"" looks like total garbage and I should not be allowed to even try. I even took a sketching class last year and it was one of the most humiliating experiences I had because we had to show our work to the class. 
My least favourite subject in school (besides math) was English class. You're not alone."
2075,isfp,"I TOTALLY agree with this, and the label ""artist"" made me think I must not be ISFP. I have since learned that it's just a poor label.
I will say I love taking in the arts, like listening to music, going to tons of movies, art shows, etc. I'm even a singer in a choir. But if you asked me to CREATE art, that would make me super uncomfortable. I am much more into the mastery of what I'm doing than I am about creating a new way of doing it, which is very much an S trait over an N trait.
I wouldn't say interest in art is an F thing either...but the motivations for taking in art for F types and T types are different. For F types, it's about finding things that enhance beauty and make you feel loved, anything that creates an emotional response. For T types it's more about how does this art influence the world. Not saying that's exclusive to each...that just tends to be the preference. My main point here is that ""artist"" isn't even necessarily an F thing...there are tons of great T artists throughout history. The artist label is dumb.
Adventurer is way better. I recently bought a camera and just started going to campsites so I could take some cool pictures. But really my goals there are taking in beauty and getting some adventure. "
2076,isfp,"I like art and more an more with age. But it's not only art. I basically love astheticaly beautiful things. But I can't make art at all. But I can do a lot of ""house building"" etc. I think I have a very creative mind. I am also good in sports. And I love adventure as long as it does not include anything dangerous. I also don't like to travel. My adventure in life has mostly been in the way I consume things around me:)"
2077,isfp,"It isn't supposed to be about literal art. It's more about focusing on aesthetics and sensory details. I agree a different name would help though, it tends to confuse new people in the mbti community. I like composer or aesthete  myself."
2078,isfp,"Take me to the sun, I like the sun
I do not want more fights
I already lost all my tears
why you so fucking annyoing?
‚Äã
when you're there I don't want to be sleeping all day
I want us to eat a pineaple together
and doing drugs with you
I hope the sun removes your tears
‚Äã
You know how to make love sucking
I want to sleep 17 hours in a row
and holding you all that time
everything else can go fuck itself"
2079,isfp,Yall are perceived as the sexiest because of how difficult it is to get to know you guys and your lack of being attention-seeking so it comes across as mysterious. That's fleeting tho. Trying to pull teeth to get someone to open up loses its luster after a while. 
2080,isfp,"We just seem we are the least type to do so.. inferior Te?
Anyone want to prove me wrong?
I personally lose all interest when a conversation turns into business. At first I enjoy the idea but don't seem stimulated by the practicality of it."
2081,isfp,"I have a couple of niche e-commerce stores. I just get ideas for stores sometimes, it is a lot of busywork to build them up but I'm pretty good at minding the details and seeing projects through to the end. Plus I majored in business and finance in college so I may have more intuition for this stuff. Now the corporate business world... I don't think I'm cut out for that."
2082,isfp,"I'm a bit obsessed with the idea of starting a business but I don't think I have the guts to go through with it. I like to think about it and dream about it (heck, sometimes even research it and plan out potential businesses) but I worry that I will fail and end up bankrupt or something."
2083,isfp,"When I read your title I thought it was going to be about how common it is for ISFPs to want to start their own business. Most ISFPs I've met are entrepreneurs at heart, who enjoy being their own boss and investing in themselves. Not likely a corporation, but a small business, yes. "
2084,isfp,I am highly involved in the strategic planning and operations of the business I work for. One of the things that keeps me interested is the ability to create and explore my own solutions. This is most likely tantamount for ISFPs in a similar situation.
2085,isfp,"Im wondering because I came across a book called how to stop elderly abuse by Anne Hart. It talks about different personality types and how they fit or clash with one another. I didnt expect that from this book.
It goes on to say an ISFP woman is good with another ISFP.
Im an ISFP man, who had a crush before on an ISFP woman. I was afraid though, unsure of myself because I felt bad about a previous relationship with an ISFJ and i was afraid of hurting another person if i get into a relationship.
I told her my feelings for her, and she was giddy that someone liked her, and then i was afraid of myself and i told her im not a good guy to be with.
Then she gives me a very blunt msg telling me that i should be more positive, and that got me worried because, as an ISFP, I understand her view to want to be more positive.
Sometimes as ISFP we can be sad, and i was worried.
I want also to have someone positive so i understood her bluntness and i felt afraid that im not good so i blocked her.
Its been months but
I want to make amends.
I dont know how she would take it if i tried talking to her again.
When the times i talked to her, we had this understanding of each other, like we knew how the other was feeling. It was like as if we could read each others' minds.
Its was an amazing experience, but i dont know if she would want to talk to me still after what i did.
Any help?"
2086,isfp,"According to socionics studies long lasting identical type relations are uncommon. Identical type relationships are great for friendship, but you have exactly same strong points and weak points, so while you can understand and sympathize with them, you can't really help each other that much in life, neither can they tell you something radically new, insightful, and ground-breaking. Dating same type is exhilarating at first, from there is rapidly deflates.   
This picture http://i.imgur.com/vBU1KwF.png shows the distribution of intertype relations among married couples. The top three relationship for ISFP from this picture are Duality (ENTJ), Activity (INTJ), and Semi-Duality (ESTJ), while ""identity"" which is a relationship between identical types is at the very bottom as least common long-term relationship type."
2087,isfp,"It shows results of a study done by Ekaterina Filatova, whose type is EII (INFP). She interviewed a whole bunch of people to determine their types and then looked at which type matches were most commonly found in families. Her study was still pretty small scale from what I remember, it was less than 100 families in total while for good statistics one needs more data points than this.
Socionics predicts that some part of any relationship will be influenced by what arrangement of cognitive functions you and your partner have (eg your types), and that these relationship patterns are stable and predictable, and these patterns are described in this table:  Wikisocion: Intertype Relations Overview (keep in mind that socionics switches j/p letters for introverts from MBTI, so ISFP becomes ISFj/ESI) And this is an easy interactive square that plots out MBTI types to Soconics types by functions and lists their intertypes for you when you scroll your mouse over any given type: TypeSquare"
2088,isfp,"I came upon a certain (YouTube) video in which the person was saying that we ISFPs might have problems with boundaries and tend to let people walk over us because we're so nice and that it's conditioned into us by society. It kind of opened my eyes because I didn't see it that way before. My question is, do you recognize some of those patterns in yourself (or are you self-defeating in other ways)? Do you see yourself as easily walked over?"
2089,isfp,"Not necessarily. I wouldn‚Äôt say we‚Äôre ‚Äúself-defeating‚Äù.
Perhaps I do let people walk over me in the sense I‚Äôm super forgiving. I have been done very wrong by people in the past - and even with a shitty apology I will still accept it. Hell, without an apology I still forgive people. I never, ever hold grudges. 
I do however think we‚Äôre stronger than people believe; particularly ourselves. Yeah, perhaps we do let people walk over us. But I think even when that occurs, we‚Äôre strong enough to just put it aside and stay human. Stay caring. I think that takes a lot more strength than is led to believe; a lot of self control. Forgiveness is a powerful thing.
May I ask for the video? And of course, happy cake day !"
2090,isfp,"I would say that I am. I am pretty passive and not very assertive, so I am used to letting people walk over me. lately I have been able to stand up for myself a little bit more, and not let them take advantage of me but it's something I still have to work on"
2091,isfp,"I think it's the issue of having peace and harmony around us. I do have a small issue of creating boundaries, and if I sense that someone is helpless, I would try my best to help them. Even if that drains out my energy.
But if I find that I have been lied to, or taken unfair advantage of, I simply cut them off. There's no way I'm getting back with them."
2092,isfp,"I definitely have let that happen for a while. I don‚Äôt wanna say ‚Äúwalk all over‚Äù but I definitely let things slide. Or I‚Äôll apologize for something when I know full well it was their fault not mine. I just really don‚Äôt want to end up being an asshole so I overcompensate. I‚Äôm a Type 3 so I‚Äôm so so good at compartmentalizing my emotions (almost too good where‚Äôs the line of compartmentalizing and repressing? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)  So I think since I‚Äôm better at it I should be more understanding. People can take shit out on me cuz I can handle it but they shouldn‚Äôt have to. 
This year I‚Äôve been trying to set boundaries and recognize my own needs and ask for them. Someone pointed out to me that it really depends on how much self respect you have at some point. Like sure he forgiving but enough is enough sometimes. My needs are valid too! 
Also friendships are two sided. Are my close relationships actually even friendships if they don‚Äôt know me or my needs and who I am?"
2093,isfp,"Thanks for the reply, I kind of agree with you on the strength. It's hell of a task sometimes but I do try to maintain it :p
yup, here
Thanks! üòä"
2094,isfp,"This is exactly what I think. 
I also struggle with people thinking less of me because they think I‚Äôm weak, or being walked over. But I just think I‚Äôm awesome for being so forgiving and showing compassion."
2095,isfp,"I second this! You have explained me word for word!!! 
I‚Äôve had friends say stop letting people use you but I never saw it that way. I feel good helping people and sure sometimes you don‚Äôt get anything in return or worse used but I still feel good about it. 
And yeah years ago I tried to hold a grudge towards someone who kept using me but I would forget and forgive them subconsciously anyway. We are still friends today lol. 
Speaking from experience I think it‚Äôs still really important to make an effort to show ourselves the same love and care we would for others. I think isfps can be pretty bad at that."
2096,isfp,"I did this 16Personalities test and I got ISFP. After reading the description of this type and some things on this subreddit, I don't really relate to many of these things. 
This just feels like another ""signs of the zodiac"" thing where people only relate to things that actually happen to them and ignore the rest.
edit: I've gone through the test twice and got this result.
??help??"
2097,isfp,"It‚Äôs likely that the 16personalities test is inaccurate and is giving you the type that‚Äôs similar to yours but isn‚Äôt it really. I‚Äôd recommend trying other sites, to gauge if it‚Äôs just a fluke of this one test. 
As far as I recall your ‚Äúadjacent‚Äù types are INFP, ISFJ, ESFP, might want to look these up in case they‚Äôd sound more accurate.
You‚Äôre also correct in your idea that this thing is much like a horoscope, it‚Äôs only meant to provide possible insights for you to consider, that may or may not be true. Either way, you learn something about yourself equally by thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely like this‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely not like this‚Äù. Thinking about MBTI like an oracle or a life guide wouldn‚Äôt be wise."
2098,isfp,They wanna be the best and prove it however you will never boast about it but you get very happy when someone compliments you but you won't show your happy cause you don't know how to cause you're shy? 
2099,isfp,"It's a bit hard to explain, but for example, lots of people identify with certain subcultures during high school, do self-reflection, do lots of stuff to get to know themselves and talk about themselves with others.
But I never really did that, I just observe and do stuff. I don't think about myself, who I am, and I don't really talk about myself either. I almost always talk about other people, or things I like doing."
2100,isfp,"I always thought of life like a first person movie. Like where I'm the main character and everything is shot through my eyes, but that's the same concept as a first person video game I suppose. But yes I can relate with you. Also, most of my dreams are in third person. Where I watch myself do things as if I'm the camera filming my body do things. "
2101,isfp,"Yeah, totally. I'm not sure if it's related, but I don't particularly like first person games either. Which is to say that I don't mind them, but pretty much 100% of the time I wish they were third person. Do other ISFP gamers feel the same way?"
2102,isfp,"Yeah pretty much. Sometimes I wish others could experience life through my eyes (and witness its beauty in all the sensory ways).
(edit: but also sometimes I feel like I can't detach from my body and I view that as a bit problematic...)"
2103,isfp,"My life feels like pieces of an ""emotional narrative"" ... recursive memories and a few scenes from movies contribute to a sense of meaning (or anti-meaning) that strings through my experiences. I don't see myself as a character in this existence, I just seek the continued external narrative, which is in truth a projection of my feelings onto my environment."
2104,isfp,I'm in good terms with only one of my exes and because that was the only time when we split by common decision. Every other time I was the one breaking up and I had no reason to be their friends. I just close that chapter and move on.
2105,isfp,"No because the break up was too hard so we decided itd be best to cease contact and eventually we both got into new relationships. I messaged him one time a year after we broke up to gauge his interest in a friendship and got no response. Its best this way. We're both happy with our S/Os now so it all worked out :) are we friends? No. on good terms? Yes In the sense that we wish each other well.
My other highschool ex and i like eachothers stuff on instagram and ive seen him around town a few times and been friendly. So we are like passive social media friends. Hes pretty chill."
2106,isfp,"When my ex broke up with me, we stayed in contact for about another year before naturally ceasing conversation. Same happened with this one girl I tried dating, we didn‚Äôt last a month but it was enough time for me to get emotionally invested. I don‚Äôt really regret breaking off contact with both, letting go after giving my heart away is not something I can do easily (I‚Äôm still having a hard time dealing with having my heart broken by both of them today)."
2107,isfp,"in english class, we learned about the concept of sublime in romantic literature and i think its something that would resonate with us (it probably resonates with everybody regardless of type but i feel like it‚Äôs especially amplified with us and i‚Äôve attributed it to fi+se). it‚Äôs basically the feeling of awe and wonder that arises in the presence of natural beauty. romanticism is very fi because it entailed opposition to organised structures and strongly emphasised individuality. the romantic poets also believed that the emotional power of nature transcended rationality.
anyway i fell in love with this idea because even looking at pictures of nature makes me feel a sense of calm i can‚Äôt quite describe. i get lost in the beauty of the world and the richness in colours. in these moments, thinking about meaning doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me. fi+se is not concerned with creating meaning but just experiencing and appreciating the full moment and seeing it as what it is and that‚Äôs okay. maybe there‚Äôs meaning in that - does something have to be profoundly meaningful in order for it to be valued?"
2108,isfp,"Totally. When I'm in a place in nature that's extremely beautiful (which by my definition is practically everywhere, lol) I've sat there for hours just amazed at it. That's part of the reason I love canoe trips so much. Of course there's talking with the other people, but if you're canoeing for hours there are always long pauses where everyone is just paddling together and silently appreciating everything around you.
As for the whole meaning thing... Well, happiness can have meaning, can't it? I mean, we don't know what happens when you die, so if you lived a happy life, you felt like you mattered, and you helped other people do the same, then that's about all most of us can hope for. It follows then, that this romantic sublime, an extreme form of happiness, must be meaningful because it brings us closer to one of our key goals in life. Maybe it's not deep, because looking at nature doesn't tell you anything profound. But in my eyes, deep and meaningful are not the same thing.
So there's my inner philosophy hippie for the day. :P"
2109,isfp,"I get it. And it saddens me when people who don't get it pity me and think I'm naive and childish. Or that I don't have anything better to do than to be in awe at just what surrounds me. I think that being able to appreciate and being fascinated with life itself, is one of the most pure things to exist. I would say, for me, a humanist, contemplating and filling my eyes with nature and life it's the closest thing to spirituality."
2110,isfp,"For me, yeah. I don't really like art unless there's some kinda deeper meaning behind it, actually, scratch that, I like looking at art that's not ""deep"" but I never consider it a ""masterpiece"" or anything like that."
2111,isfp,"This. I made so many great friends and memories when I used to play League. And Monster Hunter. Currently playing Requiem: Rise of the Reaver, but it's pretty much a dead game. Still gonna play it though for the nostalgia and screenshot opportunities. "
2112,isfp,"Looking back on who I feel TOTALLY comfortable with... There are not many people at all. I feel like I might make myself feel out of place without thinking about it. I just feel like no one understands me or even wants to. 
I never really fit in at the school I attended for 14 years, either side of my family, my church (depending on who I was with, even my school friends. 
Is this just me being introverted and paranoid? Or do you guys feel it too?
Sorry this sounds so whiny :) I didn't mean for it to sound that way!"
2113,isfp,I definitely feel that way sometimes as well. I have a few close friends and family members and my fiancee who I truly feel comfortable with. Most other groups I just feel out of place in. Still trying to work out what I can do to feel better about being in group settings...
2114,isfp,"For me it's rather odd, outright just telling me to ""fuck off"" or insult me doesn't really bother me that much, but I really despise it when people do the same towards things I like.
Outside of that, it also really depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm super irritable and very easily ticked off, and sometimes pretty much nothing gets to me."
2115,isfp,"I‚Äôm very thick skinned and I laugh off practically everything. But, I find that every comment meant to hurt me (and there are very few) does strike somewhere deep inside me. 
I‚Äôve noticed this from talking about times people have called me out. First I always think like ‚Äúoh yeah, they have a point haha‚Äù and move on but really thinking about it makes me feel like trash."
2116,isfp,"Pretty thick skinned. The only way is get insulted is if you're a close friend, saying something very specific about me, to me for the sole purpose of insulting me or someone I care about. (Close friends shouldn't do that anyways no matter how mad or upset they are)
Life's too short to get offended/triggered/angered by stupid people, and stupid things."
2117,isfp,"It depends on the intention of the person. People who actively try to hurt me in an argument out of the heat of the moment don't get to me. It's when they say something rude unintentionally, that it cuts me deep."
2118,isfp,"idk, i want to be thick skinned but sometimes some things really irritate me too much and then i realize it's not something to be irritated over. idk
edit: fortunately i usually have time to think about those things so i don't get to act on my irritation"
2119,isfp,"bioshock series, life is strange, stardew valley, borderlands 2 if i‚Äôm playing with my friends, runescape bc i still live in 2007 (even tho i play rs3...)
i have a lot more on my ‚Äúto play‚Äù list. like a LOT more. but not much time to play them rn "
2120,isfp,"JRPG (Dragon Quest, Xenogears, Final Fantasy, Disgaea, etc), Metroidvania (Mega Man Zero and ZX, Castlevania, etc), Hack n Slash (God of War, Metal Gear Rising, Dead Rising) and pretty much anything with an anime aesthetic like Danganronpa and other VNs."
2121,isfp,"I can't stop going back to the Dragon Age series recently. I really loved Origins and Inquistion. I also love Persona and Final Fantasy games. I guess I'm an rpg fan. 
As for online games, I've been playing LoL, Overwatch, and Maplestory. "
2122,isfp,The games I love the most are games which have a fantastic set of characters; they‚Äôre really what I remember the most from a game rather than the story or gameplay. Games like the Mass Effect series and Chrono Trigger have a special place in my heart for this very reason.
2123,isfp,"Ive been playing Dota for like 13 years. Had a brief LoL stint. Then there is alot. Played WoW, diablo 2, dungeon seige, serious sam, bioshock, Deus ex, witcher 2&3, portal, half life, CoD, battle feild, borderlands 2, need for speed, age of empires, C&C generals, warcraft 3, assassin's Creed 2-4, lotr battle for middle earth. There are a lot more. 
Soo I enjoy playing games. Any rpg with a decent story, and shooters and driving games for stress relief. But I mainly just play Dota 2 now. I do enjoy playing with a friend more than playing alone. "
2124,isfp,"I can enjoy almost any kind of genre but my enthusiasm doesn't always last so long. My favorite series tend to be action rpgs like Skyrim or the Witcher, sandboxes like GTA and rdr, or sports/simulation type games "
2125,isfp,"Are you me? I love Minecraft and the two Portal games. I love any puzzle game (I‚Äôve been playing ‚ÄúThe Witness‚Äù recently, lots of fun figuring out the different puzzles there), and I love the freedom Minecraft offers me.
Modded Minecraft has been my go to for a while now, and figuring out how I can automate all the machines is really fun!
I also like PUBG, but I usually die whenever I find someone else. I‚Äôve gotten lucky a few times, and have gotten one chicken dinner in Duos with a roommate of mine. I got the winning kill (by accident...)"

Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially ""remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word"".
And your fucking delete function doesn't work. You're useless.

2128,isfp,"Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up:
I learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless,
and 'one lot' is it's most useful one, it's just here to help. This is like screaming at
someone for trying to rescue kittens, because they annoyed you while doing that. (But really CMB get some quiality mnemonics)
I do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective.
Have a nice day!"
2129,isfp,"Most of the time I try to distract myself from my emotions if I don't feel like dealing with them or are unable to at the time. 
But I do not feel that you can destroy emotions, you can ignore them and distract yourself from them but they will be there until you decide to confront them. Destroying them is not an option."
2130,isfp,"In public places or large groups even with friends I barely show any emotions but when I am with just friends I don't hide any really, except sadness I never show that I am down. Oh, also, if I get too angry or any negative emotions I turn blank, there are no thoughts or anything, I am just blank and just feel warm and only slight feelings of the one emotion that overloaded everything"
2131,isfp,"I was out to eat with my ISFP boyfriend and his friend the other day when his friend opened his wallet to reveal a number of photos of his girlfriend. My boyfriend saw the photos and ‚Äújokingly‚Äù asked if he could have one right in front of me. He‚Äôll occasionally bring her up in conversation‚Äînothing hyper-suggestive, but nonetheless slightly concerning. However, he‚Äôll conversely tell me that she is boring and only talks about school and work. 
I try to be understanding of the idea that my boyfriend will find other girls attractive, as attraction is a natural aspect of human biology, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he wants to date someone or that he loves them as he loves me. However, I can‚Äôt help but feel that he has been acting inappropriately about it and that he was rather insensitive in the way he went about it. Am I overreacting or is it worth talking to him about?"
2132,isfp,"What a dick. ISFPs know better than to do that kind of thing and would hate for someone to do that to us. We are all about respectful monogamous connections. If he is indeed ISFP, this seems like an attempt to get a rise out of you or a desperate bid for attention....either that or he‚Äôs aspie levels of self absorbed.
Tell him to cut it out."
2133,isfp,"Not isfp specific and can be acted out in different ways, he is trying to be a ""bad boy"" and make the other person feel worse about themselves so they don't leave. If I were going to take a wild guess I would say the relationship will not last. 
That kind of stuff is related to gaming a girl and getting with them short term. It never works out long term even if it's subtle."
2134,isfp,"It‚Äôs a relative issue. I won‚Äôt find it inappropriate, but it‚Äôs not about whether he‚Äôs being inappropriate. The point is it doesn‚Äôt make you feel comfortable, and you should tell him how it makes you feel."
2135,isfp,"his personality type doesn‚Äôt predict his behavior in a relationship and it can‚Äôt really tell us anything about his motives. Any type can do things like this that bother you/are disrespectful. What his type might help you with is the way you go about talking to him. isfp types tend to be good listeners that are in touch with their emotions and can usually understand what others are feeling. I think if you approach it gently but directly and explain how his actions make you feel, he should understand."
2136,isfp,"My only true friend is the girl I have known since kindergarden (21 years). I have had a hard time making/keeping new friends, not because I'm unfriendly, but because it's exhausting for my soul (which sounds absolutely mental but I think people here will understand what I mean)"
2137,isfp,"Most friends I now make is through work and actively trying to bond over hobbies. Back in the day I had a lot of friends because of university and school, but since I don't have that anymore and most people moved to different cities I don't have a lot of friends anymore. Old flat mates are a good source as well. But I'm mostly home with my boyfriend, so I definitely feel more like a loner the older I get ;-)
Funny enough I was at a park yesterday and a young woman came to me and asked if she can sit with me because she doesn't have lots of friends in our city and she would like to meet some like minded people. That was so nice :) She was really nervous :D I found that to be super brave and impressive, I think she's very introverted as well. We talked, exchanged phone numbers, and I definitely would like to meet up with her again. 
So, even if it seems hard, but there are many people who are like-minded and struggle finding new friends. Even if talking to new people is nerve-wrecking in the beginning. It might be worth it to just go for it, like she did :)"
2138,isfp,Almost everyone I talk to now is on the internet besides family. My main group of friends are people I met through my SO and the other circles are acquaintances on an IRC channel. I'm loosely in touch with college and high school friends who I met through my classes. 
2139,isfp,"The thing is if I have something to do, I get it done and even sometimes get obsessed with it. but when I dont have anything to do I'm super lazy and don't initiate anything because I'm totally fine just doing pretty much nothing. A lot of the time it feels like im wasting potential
Anyone relate to this? How can I start getting the motivation to initiate things, be organized, etc like a J does? "
2140,isfp,"Yeah, I can relate. I think as ISFPs, we don't really like making plans for ourselves, we just want to do whatever we feel like in the moment, even if that's nothing. Often I tell myself, ""I will do ____ today!"" Then I don't do it and am totally fine with it because I did what I felt like doing at the time. 
Personally, I like to keep a list on my phone. Just anything I want/need to do when I have time. I'll be honest, some of those things take a loooong time to get crossed off, but having them down is a constant reminder, and it feels super satisfying to tick something off, so it does help a bit. 
And really, just start! Starting things is always the hardest, but I find, in most cases, it's so much easier to continue and finish once you start, and being productive feels really really good! But also, don't worry about giving yourself a bit of time to just ""do nothing"", it's good relaxation. "
2141,isfp,"I totally relate to this. I even get bored of playing the same games after a while. I don't understand how people play the same games for months/years. 
But yeah, my gf is INFP and she's pretty motivated to doing stuff, but I'm perfectly content just sitting around after work and just watching TV. I can't even get motivated to switch to reading :/"
2142,isfp,"Use 3 goals system. On beggining of day. Set Yourself 3 tasks to do. They can be simplest tasks on earth(laundry, dishes, buy new shoes). At the end of day, sum it up. Did you succeed or have You failed? And same for next day. 
Also set Yourself 3 tasks for a week and 3 for a month and 3 for a year. I really like this system. Maybe I should do an app for that?"
2143,isfp,"When I receive something as a gift or I buy it myself, I treat it like it was a family member. Everything I own I have had for years. And everything I purchase these days is either hobby related or a necessity like food and gas (I'm young yes haha). My family gets mad at me for buying expensive things like Computer parts or audio gear but I take care of my shit. Although I may have expensive taste at least I'm not buying a new iPhone every year because I dropped it ten times (never cracked my phone ever). Or buying new clothes all the time because I don't care for them. And better yet I don't spend my paycheck on drugs or alcohol, so get off my case. Sorry for the rant but people don't really seem to get it that we like to take care of our shit ( assuming I am not alone)."
2144,isfp,Not me! I'm shit at looking after my things. If I crack my phone screen and it becomes un-usable I really don't think twice about the money I spend to get it fixed. Only a minor annoyance. And I still wouldn't bother getting a case for it. Lots of my money goes on food alcohol and drugs and clothes haha.
2145,isfp,"I'm actually very frugal. I have a spending budget.
50% on necessities, 30% on expenses and 20% savings. I'm a student so I kinda have to be strict with money. Before college I used to spend money like it was nothing. "
2146,isfp,Yeah I did too. These days all I try to do is keep $200 on my debit card for gas and food and other goods. Everything else goes into my savings account. It's around the time of my birthday right now so I decided to treat myself a bit and upgrade some stuff. Also I try not to spend more than $10 on a meal but some days I'm paying for all my meals. Life is fun
2147,isfp,"(Please don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm not trying to make this into a type me thread. These are just examples on how I‚Äôve identified with both types and how I don‚Äôt fit some of the extravert traits, hopefully helping clear up the whole ‚Äúare you shy or outgoing?‚Äù sterotypes.)
Ok. I‚Äôve identified as ESFP for a long time now. But lately I‚Äôve been confusing with ISFP because quite honestly, I don‚Äôt: 


‚ÄúHurr durr manipulate and control the environment and people.‚Äù I would rather just go with the flow rather than ‚Äòpush my own agenda.‚Äô  Unless something is really super important to me, I‚Äôm not forcing anything.


I don‚Äôt ever really take the ‚Äòlead.‚Äô I‚Äôd rather let someone else more confident do it. I really hate bossing people around.


I don‚Äôt know if this is whether I‚Äôm shy or was actually an introvert this entire time but: I can‚Äôt bring myself to initiate conversations. I might be standing in line, or sitting next to someone on the bus, and as much as I would like to make a friend I‚Äôm just too pussy to actually say hi or talk to them. And it‚Äôs also very painful if I do somehow muster up the guts to say hi and they don‚Äôt even hear me. I just think: well damn I‚Äôd be less uncomfortable just keeping my face in my phone. Now if they start the conversation, that‚Äôs a different story. I‚Äôd be more than happy to talk with them for hours and hours. I don‚Äôt even mind small talk. But the point I‚Äôm trying to make here is I can‚Äôt initiate a conversation for the life of me!


I‚Äôm rarely the ‚Äúlife of the party.‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind being the center of attention, but I‚Äôm not constantly trying to throw myself out there. If I speak up and everyone listens, omg cool! But I‚Äôm never trying to force myself in the spotlight 24/7. I kind of rely on someone else to get the group all fired up. If you put me in a dead, cold silent room with people who seem depressed or uninterested in conversation, I‚Äôm not going to be the typical ESFP that ‚Äúlights everything up with my presence‚Äù and makes things lively. Like I said, I sort of just go with it. I‚Äôd rather it be more fun but I‚Äôm not the kind of person who would cause that.


One of my friends actually thought I was an introvert (reference to point 3) because I was acting shy when I first met her. I sat next to her because I sort of wanted to talk to her, but I couldn‚Äôt actually talk to her. She was actually surprised I was typed ESFP because of that. 


Although, I‚Äôve never questioned my love to be around people. Even though I don‚Äôt initiate conversations or rile everybody up, I still would never turn down a social gathering. I would sooo rather go to a dinner party with lots of people at a resteraunt than stay home and read a book. Just the thought of that makes me excited.
I relate to a ton of the ESFP traits but not every single one. I also relate to a few ISFP traits too, but I honestly just feel like ESFP is the best fit for me. 
So to conclude, it is still possible to be a shy ‚ÄúE‚Äù or an outgoing ‚ÄúI,‚Äù otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do. 
Thanks so much for taking the time to read this, I really hope this was helpful.

2148,isfp,"I've always identified as being an Introvert, until I met my boyfriend who I thought was a really outgoing extrovert... let me ask you what are your energy levels after spending time with people? Are you deflated and want time alone to repair/ de-stress? Or are you almost unchanged/ even more energized? I've always just assumed I was introverted because I kept to myself, and my boyfriend extroverted because he can hold a strong conversation with almost anyone and everyone. However it comes down to the energy levels.
I hate being alone, and I always seem to be alone, but when I'm with others I feel comfort in being with them, even though I will happily avoid unknown social situations/ get awkward if I am involved in them. But I'm not drained at all, not even in the slightest. Where as my boyfriend who can talk the legs off a donkey if he wants to, really seriously gets overwhelmed by the end of it and really craves the alone time. 
An example which sort of solidified it for me... we've been together for 5 years, and always been around each other and our families... and we get along really well with each others family like a house on fire. However I started to notice whilst I would always be around either chatting with my parents or his parents, he whilst being heavily involved in the conversation for quite some time, would slowly slink off to a room and start doing his own thing. I used to get sooo MAD at him, like stop being rude and come and talk. But despite many conversations regarding the matter, and him saying he would improve and whilst he did a little, at the end of the day I'd still find him off on his own having crept away. And It just didn't make sense why he kept going and practically hiding...until I started to think what if I'm just a shy extrovert, and he's an outgoing introvert, and that suddenly explained everything.
The real question is though so I identify as Introvert/ambiverted/or extroverted? I'd say yes I'm just an awkward extrovert with introverted tendencies because of my social anxiety. And because of that I can relate more to the introverted tendencies identified in the MBTI. I doubt this has made things clearer for you but maybe give you something to think about?
Tl/dr - there is such a thing as an outgoing introvert and a shy extrovert. "
2149,isfp,I feel like I‚Äôm never really ‚Äòdrained‚Äô after spending time with people. If we‚Äôre going out again later I‚Äôm always up for it. I really do love being in social gatherings and being around people. If that‚Äôs the identifying clue for E vs I then I can definitely identify as ESFP.. I‚Äôm just shy. Thanks so much for your insight!
2150,isfp,"A lot of things made sense while I was reading this. My long-time-friend/newly boyfriend has been baffled when we've gone out with long-time friends because he says i'm a completely different person. While normally he is the extroverted and talkative one, when we're out in groups, I will be the loudest of the bunch. But then my energy levels slowly deplete and I have to recoup for 2 days to bring them back up again. "
2151,isfp,"Good. I'm glad I could help you realise.... however as I'm the same and looking at the personality traits/ behaviours of both, although I'd say I am just a shy extrovert, I actually possess more of the introverted behaviours because of my shyness which is why I'd for now classify myself as more ISFP. "
2152,isfp,"Yeah, it does make so much more sense. I can probably go days at a time without being alone. I think it would be absolutely the dream to have a lot of people living with me so when I can‚Äôt go out I‚Äôll still have company. I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one who gets confused by the sterotypes lol! Thank y‚Äôall for helping clear this up"
2153,isfp,Amen!! It definitely is the defining state however most thing seem to only see being introverted as shy people and extroverted people as being outgoing people. When I first breached this realisation to my boyfriend he laughed at me saying that no I'm introverted and he's extroverted... and he was ready to argue the point until I said but isn't the defining difference is our energy levels... you get quite overwhelmed after being in social situations and just need alone time... and I don't at all. And he thought about it and didn't have anything more to say. So I think he's now having an identity crisis atm hahaha 
2154,isfp,"Hi Everyone,
This survey is entirely anonymous. Please answer as honestly as possible, even if you don't like your answers.
CLICK HERE FOR SURVEY
I'm really interested in Brene Brown's work on shame, vulnerability and wholeheartedness. I've noticed that, while MBTI focuses on highlighting our strengths, the discussions in many MBTI communities seem to focus on the struggle to overcome flaws or struggles with vulnerability. It seems that we're all drawn here to tinker around inside our behaviors, understand something important about ourselves, or understand the way we interact with the world. I'm wondering (informally, this is just for fun) if there's a pattern to MBTI personality types, and ease of wholeheartedness/living with courage.
So, I made this quick survey. Enjoy!(?)
Bonus Question: What socially or emotionally vulnerable experience has done the most to define your identity?"
2155,isfp,"Interesting survey. I dunno how google surveys work, but with some of these questions I bet there will be more of a gender difference than a personality difference, if you are able to check that. Will you post a comment on this thread when you‚Äôve got your results to enlighten us? c:
Also for the bonus question: I don‚Äôt want to say too much about it, but it had to do with a friend considering suicide, and we both learned a lot about each other."
2156,isfp,"Master Ball!!!  But really, just be friendly with her and try to become friends but hint and flirt romantically/show interest in her, see if she reciprocates, take a jump and ask her out. Listen to her and let her say what she wants to say, be there for her, don't get on her bad side and don't force her to do anything she doesn't want to. Just some advice but I do not take any responsibility for my advice, and really it just boils down to you just being yourself"
2157,isfp,"Hello everyone. As you can see I have changed the css of the subreddit quite dramatically. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT never fear. I can and will change anything to please you, within reason. If you see any bugs, such as odd bits of wrong colour or a missing flair please tell me.
I choose to pick blue as it is my favourite colour and I think blue reflects our calm attitude. If you guys think any of the colours could be a little more darker or brighter I can easily do that. If anyone has suggestions for the text to put in the sidebar about the sub or links please comment them below :)
Hope you like it!"
2158,isfp,"I think it needs either a second color, or a graphic banner like on r/ENTP. I really like this template, and it works well on the other subs (r/ENTP, r/ISTP, r/ENFJ) but I think this application too monochromatic."
2159,isfp,"I like the change! I've always liked minimalism. For some reason, this blue reminds me of the bold blue on Windows 8 though. Maybe something calmer along the lines of cerulean or royal blue?
As for the sidebar links, I'd suggest a few links that describe ISFPs to start. I also like the interesting links over at INFP and INFJ. Thanks for updating the sub!
Edit: I like the winky face!"
2160,isfp,"I agree, the blue at the top is meant to be different but it has turned out pretty much the same. I like the idea of trying a picture instead. Got any ideas/themes? if not send me some colours to try out and ill see what I can do :)"
2161,isfp,"I‚Äôm really good friends with a couple INFJ‚Äôs and I‚Äôve got to know what they‚Äôre like over the years. I would definitely date an INFJ being an ISFP because if they‚Äôre in a relationship, they‚Äôre ALL in and I am totally down for that. Not to mention, they‚Äôre very empathetic and have a heart of gold. Seriously. 
I have an INFJ friend that got played so many times by friends or past boyfriends and I get so mad at her old friends/exes because honestly how could you pass up someone so great and treat them like shit? Anyways, they‚Äôre pretty introverted so they‚Äôll respect your alone time and give you yours but don‚Äôt ever betray them. They have NO problem giving you the freeze/door slam. But other than that, just be genuine with them and try to be understanding. "
2162,isfp,"Oh boy. 
I dated a 23 y.o. male INFJ for a little over a year. I can write a novel on what went wrong and what I would have done differently in this relationship but I‚Äôm not going to bore you.
That being said, I think this pairing can work really well IF both types are mature. 
Let me know if you want me to expand. "
2163,isfp,"It probably depends on how healthy/unhealthy they are. My BFF is an INFJ but when we dated we had some issues:


she had/has a tendency to assume things quickly based on past (negative) experiences (Ni)


I wanted to do things, experience stuff, lots of Se-stuff I guess, and she was more like 'calm down, I need alone time', I often felt distant from her.


the Fe/Fi difference I think affected things most of all - I would often see her as being two-faced, and she'd often see me as being selfish. Our dynamic was often that she would bottle stuff up because she didn't want to 'burden' me/didn't feel right talking about HER feelings, while I opened up more and more and more in a desperate attempt to get communication going. We both had different ideas of the right thing to do when it came to talking about our feelings. I felt like it was best for both of us if I brought up something that bothered me, to resolve it. She felt that it was best for both of us if she kept any irritation/upset to herself to avoid conflict/hurting me.


I definitely think I helped her get out more and experience the world, and she helped me calm down and enjoy being quiet with somebody else. INFJs are amazingly affectionate like everybody else has said, and she gave me some of the most heartfelt and meaningful gifts while we were together."
2164,isfp,"Was in a 2 1/2 year LDR with one. I'm sure it could've continued much longer if not an LDR, but not without clear problems. Emotions and care were without a doubt as strong as it could be. However, I was far more open and communicative than she was and it seemed to be a never ending struggle to get her to open up as much as I needed, even 2 years in. Despite that, she was always very understanding, but could never change for my sake no matter how patient I was.  
All I can say it was a very meaningful and fulfilling relationship. But it was also very tiring from the differences in our thinking when it comes to how we communicate our love and attachment. It's a promising pairing for sure, though. As long as you both have the patience. Same with most any pairing really."
2165,isfp,"Long story short, we were both pretty immature and essentially the lack of direction in both of our lives caused the relationship to turn toxic. But that can happen in any relationship where both parties are immature I suppose.
The good:
-both very affectionate 
-cared immensely for one another and both had no problem expressing it 
-we had loads of fun 
-I helped develop his Se and he helped me become more intuitive 
-we learned a lot ton from each other because we were so different in how we viewed the world 
Bad:
-he was far more closed off when he was going through something then I was. He kind of built walls where as I was a lot more expressive 
-had a hard time understanding each other because of how different we were
-In the end I basically felt like I couldn‚Äôt help him reach his goals due the huge rift between the way we operated and this was our ultimate downfall
I could totally picture our relationship working really well now that I‚Äôm well on my way to what/who I want to be if we were ever by some very slim chance to get back together. I honestly enjoyed the crap out of that guy, he was extremely selfless and clever and it could have been magic. 
So yes, it could be a good match. "
2166,isfp,"My mom is an ESFJ. We definitely have our differences (she talks a LOT more than I do, and cares much more about social etiquette), but overall she is very sweet and probably the most selfless person I know. She never does anything for herself. She always lets us choose what we watch or what music we listen to or where we go for lunch. She constantly buys us small gifts, but feels guilty buying herself anything unless it‚Äôs on sale for really cheap (even though money isn‚Äôt much of an issue for us). 
My dad is an ESTP. Our relationship is a little more complicated. I‚Äôm definitely more similar to him, especially when it comes to interests and sense of humor. But we‚Äôre opposites when it comes to morals/ beliefs, which can cause us to butt heads fairly often. He is also pretty self centered, and I‚Äôve often gotten irked that he doesn‚Äôt try to help my mom with stuff around the house, even though they both work full time (I try to help her as much as I can because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair she should have to do everything). When I was younger, he would scream at me, swear at me, and insult me over small things if he had had a long day. About a year ago, he screamed at me that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúf‚Äî‚Äîing love‚Äù him because I apparently wasn‚Äôt excited enough when he had given me a necklace a few weeks prior. He also told me that I didn‚Äôt really love or care about anything other than myself, and that I‚Äôd probably never get married. I don‚Äôt think my dad is a bad guy, but he was raised in a very abusive household and really, really needs to feel liked by others, and gets his feelings hurt very easily, which usually results in him exploding. 
So I‚Äôm definitely closer to my mom lol. My parents actually get along great though, because my mom likes feeling needed and like she has a purpose, and my dad doesn‚Äôt mind other people doing stuff for him lol. For the most part, though, I get along with my parents very well, and overall, we tend to have a lot less day-to-day drama than a lot of other families I‚Äôve seen. "
2167,isfp,"Mom ( I N F J )  That's just a guess though
Honestly don't talk to her much. Never really did. My relationship with her was much better before she had her stroke though. She really isn't the same woman she used to be. A lot less judgmental than she used to be though. I just sit quietly with her for a few hours each week. We know we love each other, but we hardly have a damn thing in common. Never did really. Neither of us are talkers either. I used to play Scrabble with her a lot, but her vision is so bad nowadays that she couldn't play if she wanted to.
‚Äã
Dad ( I S F P ) Like father like son
Its been eleven months since he passed. I fucking miss him. We, likewise to my mother, shared no common interests, but had the best conversations. At some point I stopped trying to make him proud, and from then on its like I had a really old best friend. I used to visit home once a week and me and him would stay up until the sun came up talking about stuff. He was my best friend. Starting to cry so I'm gonna stop at that."
2168,isfp,"Intp(for sure) and Enfp(I think).
My dad's pretty funny, and I have many good memories including him. I've always been a bit of a daddy's girl haha. However, I don't feel like I know him too well. He's not forthcoming about himself, and he never tried to teach me values or skills or anything like that, so I dont know what he believes in really, apart from a few things I've weasled out of him.
My mom has betrayed my trust hard in the past so I've kept an emotional distance from her. She's tried being affectionate and caring and I appreciate that, and feel bad, but I dont trust it. She's more forthcoming about her opinions, and she took me and my siblings to church (though those beliefs didnt stick). Like my dad she never really taught me many skills. Shes also a lot chattier than I am, and talks about topics that I dont find engaging."
2169,isfp,"My dad is ISFP thought, lol. I get along with him now but teenage years fucked everything for a while.
don't know the type of my mom completely sure, but she typed ENFJ in a test and I can see her like one. I don't get alone with her since she's extremely unhealthy with a lot of things. "
2170,isfp,"Hey fellow ISFPs. What‚Äôs been your experience with ENTJs? Friends, relationships, dates, coworkers, anyone. I went on a couple of dates with an ENTJ Enneagram 8, and lord I never wanna meet another one ever again. üòÖ"
2171,isfp,"Love them. They balance me out. One of my best friends in high school was an ENTJ and she was awesome. I dated one on and off for years and have a couple of ENTJ in-laws.
The intense ones can be tough if you‚Äôre particularly sensitive, but I‚Äôm amazed by their energy and assertiveness. The female ones are often better because they‚Äôre more empathetic and emotionally aware."
2172,isfp,"I've been in a relationship with one for almost a year, and let me tell you it hasn't been too healthy for me. I'm very easy going and he hates doing what other people want to do, so I end up compromising on everything. I hate influencing other peoples actions, so I wait until I'm right at my breaking point before asserting what I want/need, and even then he'll always respond with ""nah dont feel like it sorry."" I love to go out and go on adventures, and he loves to stay home, so we've only been out a handful of times. On the rare occasion that we'll go do something I want to do, he'll spend the next few weeks reminding me of how generous he was for doing that for me, and how much energy/time/money it took from him which makes me feel like a burden. He saps my energy gives so little back. Needless to say I'm not recommending this situation. 
I know I should get out, but right now, a boring relationship is better than nothing. I've just accepted that I'll never get more from him than a night in watching TV, and I can deal with that. (Also I'm a pussy who hates confrontation lol sos)
EDIT: wording"
2173,isfp,"Never met any of them (or probably I just avoid them after I got a bad vibe around them XD).
But I know a classmate who is an INTJ. Surprise surprise, I tend to avoid talking to him. He's too judgemental and questions every smallest things that crossed his logic or value."
2174,isfp,"Every system has a different opinion on what ""intuitive"" means. CS Joseph (I recall) says that Ni is ""wanting"", like something pops in your head and now you want that. If I'm wrong correct me, but Trump is like that. Maybe in other systems he would be another thing.
And well, this is out of topic but you're praising intuition as ""smart"" wih the comparative with peanut butter. I don't think functions work like that. I may get downvotes but whatever."
2175,isfp,"Then what's Ni and Ne? In every fucking site I see different shit everywhere. The pompous say it's about the deep mind and being able to see the future or some shit. I just can't believe that.
And I thought Se was more about simply enjoying the moment.
Sorry about assuming the smarty thing. That's what the majority of people in mbti does think about it and you phrased it similarly."
2176,isfp,"term that might justly be applied to the contents of the
unconscious. The relation of inner objects to consciousness is
entirely analogous to that of outer objects, though their reality
is not physical but psychic. They appear to intuitive
perception as subjective images of things which, though not
to be met with in the outside world, constitute the contents of
the unconscious, and of the collective unconscious in
particular. These contents per se are naturally not accessible
to experience, a quality they have in common with external objects. For just as external objects correspond only relatively
to our perception of them, so
the phenomenal forms of the inner objects are also
relative‚Äîproducts of their (to us) inaccessible essence and of
the peculiar nature of the intuitive function.

Not sure if this helps :D Elon Musk said that his brain is more like a GPU than a CPU and that inside his brain, all ideas have a visual form."
2177,isfp,"Be still in your bubble. I used to have issues being in public at times. Recently I was cooped up at home for a long period of time and I found out I have created a space within me, a small home which I can return into when I am uncomfortable. Treat yourself like a physical house with hollowed rooms in u. Also did tried mediation, did it because was learning the ways of Buddhism, did it nightly as simple as count to 130 then count down. More control in dreams and I really felt better. But I loss interest after 3 months. Just know that everything will pass. "
2178,isfp,"AMA, if you wish, haha. 
It's way more satisfying that I could have ever imagined. I've never felt so loved or cared for in my whole life!
Surprisingly, it's much smoother than my relationship with an ESFX, which is usually supposed to be our best match. (It sucked.)
Anyway, just thought I would share because it seems like an ISFP/INTJ, working couple is a weird-ass combo to find.
Edit: the main reason I posted this is because I want to emphasize that you can make a relationship work with any personality type, as long as there is mutual respect. My INTJ and I may be different in many ways, but it has only enhanced the experience. 
Also holy shit INTJ sex drive. "
2179,isfp,"HELLO! Yes, weird ass combo.
Do you not get annoyed at them for thinking so much? (I get so annoyed because its like, ""who cares, lets just do something silly and we can pay for it later!)
Do they get annoyed at you for not having enough deep and insightful talks about life and the universe and stuff?
Who carries the conversation?"
2180,isfp,"INTJ with many questions. 
1.] How did you two meet? How'd you fall in love?
2.] Based off of the knowledge that I've collected, I believe that I would highly enjoy dating an ISFP. Where can I find them and how do I get to know them without making them think that I'm an overly analytical weirdo? What things should I talk about and what should I avoid discussing? In addition, how can I go about making friends with ISFPs? I mean, I'd like to date someone, but I'd be perfectly content with making a new friend. 
3.] How does flirting and dating even work? I know that this is a really broad question, but I'm absolutely clueless about this type of stuff. 
4.] What does attraction/love feel like? Is it something that happens spontaneously or does it just sort of happen over time? Do you think that the way you feel love is different than the way that your INTJ feels love? 
5.] What's your favorite flower? ... What? You said that this was an AMA. 
It's fine if you don't want to answer all of these questions (or any of them, really), but I really am interested in what you have to say. "
2181,isfp,"It's a very common and natural pairing. INTJ and ISFP share all of the same functions.
Differences in beliefs, values, education, upbringing, and physical appearance are far more indicative of possible incompatibility regarding romantic relationships. 
Uninformed people in forums might misattribute these differences to MBTI stereotypes but are proven wrong time and again in the real world, where thoughtful INTJs and educated ISFPs actually exist. "
2182,isfp,"I know I'm late to the party, but I'm in this boat right now and need to join in the INTJ love. If you guys aren't dating anymore feel free to ignore this long question post, lol.
Dating an INTJ has definitely helped us both grow as people. I think it works well because he's less cold and calculating than most INTJs - he's mostly incapable of compassion, but always wants to treat people like people and values kindness and consideration. In reverse, hanging out with him has helped develop my more logical, rational side and has made me better at expressing my thoughts through words. And yes, any personality can get along; it depends on the things you said like mutual respect and values, but also maturity - if we were both immature we wouldn't be able to stand each other.
1) How do you two have fun together? As a couple, we love to do things together like dinners and window shopping, but sometimes I wanna do crazier and more unique activities. He gets crippling anxiety with amusement parks, bungee jumping, etc. Also, he's outside doing physical labor almost all the time for his job, so he doesn't like walks, hikes, exercise - no physical or outdoor activity. We'd probably enjoy taking a road trip together, but we're too busy right now to do that. I'd love to be more adventurous and spontaneous with him, and I was wondering if you had any suggestions.
2) How do you work together? On yard work, event organizing, decision making, etc. For the most part, we can work on the same project in different roles that don't interact, or on separate things in each other's presence. In the same role and project, we both get our own ideas about how it should be, but he tends to go into control-freak-mode, pointing out things he doesn't like about my plan and trying to put his on it. I take this very harshly as personal criticism, like he's saying, ""Your idea is bad - get out of my way so I can do it better."" Even though I'm comfortable enough to assert myself to him and not always let him take advantage of me, it's an ordeal trying to convince him otherwise because he has trouble admitting when he's wrong. He's aware of this, and hates the controlling aspect of himself when it comes to that, because he sees that he's suppressing my creativity and vision. Plus I hate being bossed around :. It works great when I'm the creative vision and he's the implementing organizer/leader, though, as we're using our most developed and natural functions. While he's decided to back off and let me do my thing on my projects, and only help when asked, I'd still love to work in tandem with him sometimes. Do you have any advice on doing this, or experiences to share?
3) Omg yes INTJ sex drive. Can we talk about this or is it NSFW? I am just now discovering it. He's a dirty talker, which I love, and pretty kinky. We're way more sexually compatible than I'd have thought, even though we still need a lot of communication - I like a lot of foreplay and he moves way too quick for me lol. Unfortunately he is very self conscious about his body, and he can get really nervous when we have sex, sometimes to the point where he won't cum. Neither of us are sure why - things are fine some days but others go less smoothly. I think he's super attractive, but he doesn't fit the Men's Health physique of defined abs and beefy legs, so he doesn't think so. How can I help him be more confident about himself and in the bedroom?
Thanks for reading. Tell me all about your relationship please and thank you. Or if you're not together anymore and it makes you sad don't."
2183,isfp,"Haha, these are all things I had to sort of adjust to. 
Yes, he thinks way too much. However, I can usually either convince him to come on spontaneous adventures with me, or he sits back and makes lighthearted jokes about me being ""silly"". Because you know us ISFPs... Always getting into trouble, just for fun. 
What's nice is he is able to make everything into a joke, even if it is somewhat morbid at times. But he knows exactly when to turn the switch and be serious or just hold me when I'm upset. And he understands the dark, emotional, complicated underside of me in a way I couldn't have ever expected from an INTJ. I think he found the tenderness he had for me surprising as well. 
It's almost comforting having someone who is constantly offering a sort of structure to my thoughts, and solutions to the problems I get emotionally stuck on. 
While our conversations might lack some of the...""complexity"" that he has with some of his other NT friends, we found a very satisfying balance right away. I think it helps that I have developed my intuition pretty heartily over the past few years, and he is well rounded in the sensing area as well. It's like we get to stretch those areas of our mind with each other without it being so much that we aren't on the same page at all. 
It goes back and forth. He normally rambles about the inner workings of his mind while I listen and interject once in a while. It took some time for him to get comfortable speaking so freely, so I'm honored that I get to listen to all of it :) and there are days when it's me doing most of the talking - it depends on my mood. 
In general, we mesh surprisingly well. He had this theory that it's because he's a relatively healthy INTJ, while many can overkill on the apathy for other people or get stuck in an angry, miserable cycle (which he is prone to, but he understands how to get out of it).
Edit: just read your second comment. I know, I have never been a fan of this personality type. I have broken up with an INTJ friend and distanced myself from others because it has never worked. They're so critical and annoying. But this one is a surprisingly good one..."
2184,isfp,"Hi! Welcome, lurker. 
1) it was very uncharacteristic of us, but we met on Tinder actually. Considering how skeptical we both are, it's pretty weird and a little embarrassing. Haha. We had both gotten out of a 4 year relationship that year and were on it just to talk to people. Neither of us were really dating a whole lot. It sounds so stupid, but when we matched and began talking, I could tell something was different about him. Again, way uncharacteristic of me, but a few hours into talking, I gave him my number and we talked until 4am. We did that all day until the early hours of the morning for a week until he finally agreed to go on a date with me - he was really nervous that I wouldn't like him as much in person. We fell in love extremely quickly. Probably a few dates in. 
Keep in mind, although I'm a romance-loving ISFP, I'm a huge skeptic and a big realist. I don't fall for people easily - it takes a lot. So to fall for a guy so quickly meant a lot to me. After my last relationship, I didn't believe in love or anything like that. I felt like long term partners were a waste of a time and began to question the purpose of marriage. My ex ruined love for me, in a way. But on this third date with INTJ, I remember not being able to talk the whole time because I kept stumbling over my thoughts. I got kind of tipsy because I was so nervous. I had never felt that way before, but I assumed I was falling in love. 
Eventually, about a month later, long story short, I accidentally said ""I love you"" in French instead of ""I like you"" and we decided ""Welp, I guess we should be official since we're in love."" It was a huge whirlwind. So much fun. Terrifying, but so exciting. I had never felt that with anyone before. 
2) If you think you would like to try dating one of us, just remember that the emotional journey of your relationship will be an important piece of the puzzle for them. We enjoy the simple things in life; simple pleasures, art, music, and natural beauty. You'll find us at concerts, museums, hiking, taking art classes, etc. Look for how someone is dressed. We often wear clothes with lots of delectable patterns or colors. 
First of all, you'll have to open us up. As for you, it takes an ISFP a while to warm up to someone and really be themselves. Be careful with your opinions about us, as we are easily hurt in some aspects. That takes practice and, if you make it clear you mean no harm and aren't holding things against us that make us an individual, you're golden. My boyfriend had to explain to me ""I'm constantly judging you, but I will never love you any less or make fun of you for something I don't agree with."" And that works for me, personally. We have friendly arguments and I love that it doesn't spiral out of control. 
So avoid constant opinions or critique, but not altogether. Learn to talk about the concrete; about beauty. The key to an ISFP's trust is an open mind. 
Although my INTJ and I are very different, we use it to our advantage. He pokes fun at me for being all over the place, for being kinda disorderly, and because I squeal when I see babies and kittens. I make fun of him for being so particular. It's all in good fun. :)
3) dating is different for everyone! Have you had any dating experience before? Sometimes you have to really involve yourself in the dating world, sometimes it sort of just falls into your arms unexpectedly. Remember to be yourself or you're wasting your time, and be confident that this is all you need. That's the best advice I can give you. 
4) that's an interesting question. I think it's relative. As for me, it felt like I couldn't focus on anything else. All I wanted to do was curl up in my bed and text him forever. I couldn't eat or sleep, my friends were worried... I never felt like that, even with my ex, who I dated for four years. When we finally met each other, it was like he was too good to be true, honestly. It's funny, but I finally understood all the clich√©s people always say, like ""I love who I am when I'm with you."" I thoroughly found his presence entertaining, because he was so different from me and I felt each of our personalities supported the other's really well. Although we were both pretty shy to begin with, it got so better with time. It didn't even feel like getting into a relationship with someone; it was so easy and just so obvious that we were in the right place. I was terrified that there was going to be some catastrophic flaw that I couldn't look past. But nope, not so far. Besides being prone to anger (which I have never seen, only heard of, as I seem to have a calming effect on him), everything has only gotten better. He has agreed on all of these counts, so I don't think he feels anything much different than me, which is strange. He's much colder and more analytical, but I seem to be the only thing that makes him emotional. It's almost like I bring out the SFP qualities, which he lacks and desires to an extent. He does the same for me, in an NTJ way. 
5) Haha, I love this question. My favorite flower is a peony!"
2185,isfp,"I heard that INTJ's only love intellectually smart people.( intuitive type of smart)
I doubt  there is such thing as an ""intuitive type smart ISFP"" but even if there is an ""smart ISFP"" we won't be ""intuitively smart""
ISFP's Se "" (""it is what it is"" ) attitude plus our lack of a thinking function will almost definitely make you not like us. 
We can be friends but romantic partners...... Idk. 
There are always exceptions........ Assuming the op didn't mistype the other person."
2186,isfp,"I am a female, early 20s. 
I think it works because we are like yin and yang. We seem to fill in the holes where we lack certain qualities and welcome it completely. We are also both quite mature for our ages and have been in a long term relationship before (~4 years), and those teach you a shit ton about yourself and others. 
See my response to the question above for more details :)"
2187,isfp,"Oh wow, I thought that ISFPs were supposed to be quite terse XD
But seriously, thank you so much for taking the time to reply to my questions and for going into such deep detail. Indeed, it's actually helped me regain a bit of hope. See, I've been wondering if I actually have the capacity to love for the past few months. I mean, I've felt affection towards a lot of people and I'm pretty sure that I love my family, but I don't think that I've ever felt love, you know? However, this right here... 
... is something that I can identify with. I mean, I always get kinda' bitter whenever I see a couple getting all lovey-dovey with each other. I analyze their relationship in the most negative light possible, even though I know that I'm just bitter because I don't have what they have. Still, if you can go from a ""love means nothing"" mindset to feeling love for someone, it stands to reason that I do have the potential to feel love; I just haven't met someone suitable yet. 
To answer your question, I have had some very limited experience with dating. And by experience, I mean two dates that really weren't dates. The first date was for my high school formal winter dance in my sophomore year. I'd been talking to this one girl and subtly indicating my interest in her and I thought that I'd hit the jackpot when she asked me to accompany her to the dance. To make a long story short, it turned out that she actually had a boyfriend that I didn't know about. This hurt my feelings quite a lot and I sorta' withdrew into myself. My date left shortly after, complaining about a headache. The second date was also in my sophomore year of high school, but it only came about because I won a bet. So, for all intents and purposes, my dating experience is essentially 0. 
On a more related note, I must thank you for your ISFP dating advice. I already appreciate the more simple things in life (like staying home on a Friday night while getting lost in my music) and I'm currently taking a ceramics course, so I'm likely in contact with some ISFPs. Opening up without being overly judgmental isn't going to be easy, though. Maybe it's because I'm an INTJ and my Te overrides my Fi or maybe it's because I'm anxious and have had depression in the past, but I generally see the worst in things before I see their positive qualities. I know that it's a pretty big character flaw and I'm trying to become less judgmental, but my progress is far slower than I would like it to be. Still, progress is progress, right? Just because I'm not advancing as fast as I'd like doesn't mean that what I'm working towards isn't worth it. 
As thanks, have a peony :)"
2188,isfp,I love you too bud. You post/comment a lot and I appreciate it. I started frequenting the sub about two or three weeks ago and like a third of the posts/comments that get put on here are yours. I'll likely be seeing a lot more as I have this sub favorited now.
2189,isfp,"Yes, but learning about myself and learning something useful that applies to my life helps a lot.
I need to feel like I'm needed and when winter comes around I have to shift my focus on myself more. Then I feel happy"
2190,isfp,"I haven't been diagnosed but I feel depressed quite frequently.. I guess it happens mostly when i spend too much alone time? I also work from home so I tend to get distracted a lot which leads to me feeling unproductive, and then i start thinking too much. 
ISFPs' negative loop is the Fi-Ni loop, so we tend to overanalyze things a lot, get stuck in our feelings and are unable to relate to the way things are in world. Then we get anxious about things and the world because we're so stuck in our heads. I find myself in this a lot and then can't see the point of things a lot of the time? Why do we do what we do? Why do we do anything? To get out of the loop we need to go to our second, supporting function, Se. And really, I find that when I do something creative (I draw, I also make jewelry), or yoga, hiking, or dancing, it takes me out of my mind and into my body, physically experiencing the world. That helps me experience things in the now and kind of doens't give me the time to overthink things. It's hard to get yourself to go actually do these things sometimes but it's so worth it. 
This lasts until I feel like i need to retreat again and then the cycle starts again :-/ "
2191,isfp,"I have pretty major depressive episodes that usually last for several weeks. I don't think I have SAD though. Practicing mindfulness does seem to help me a lot though. Like, taking the time to actually eat real food and make sure I'm sleeping enough and just allowing myself to fully take in my surroundings a lot certainly helps, although of course it isn't a cure lol."
2192,isfp,This really gets on my nerves. Most of these portrayals feel like they're written by INFPs who don't have a clue about ISFPs. Neither I nor the ISFPs I know concur with any of the rubbish written about us. 
2193,isfp,I don‚Äôt know why this is either. I watched a very informative video on our cognitive function stack and it said that if our Ti (our ‚Äúdemon function‚Äù) is engaged then we can and will systematically destroy someone like no other type will.
2194,isfp,"It‚Äôs because rather than being a warrior, outgoing idea of strong, we‚Äôre the internal ‚Äúwater-is-strong-yet-sturdy‚Äù kind  of strong. It‚Äôs not expressed outwardly, unless it‚Äôs through some form of art (for me, at least), therefore, more than likely misinterpreted as weak or hippie."
2195,isfp,"I've always found INFPs to be the more 'soft'/sappy of the two, so I'm curious about why you think these things are written by INFPs? INFPs in my experience are more concept/thought driven than reality/action driven, and I would probably associate the latter with the 'ruggedness' some people mention here.
Often I think people mix up or conflate ISFPs and ISFJs. I'm not saying ISFJs are 'wimpy' or 'unambitious', but a high Fe user is probably more likely to let themselves be a doormat than a Fi user.
I also think introverted feelers in general get more of an 'uwu precious widdle cinnamon rol' typecasting.
‚Äã"
2196,isfp,"I‚Äôm not just talking about the obvious situations, like allowing yourself to have a negative reaction to someone confronting you or hurting you.
I‚Äôve noticed that when I drink (which is almost never, for reasons I‚Äôm about to mention) I have a moderation problem and tend to cut loose in a way that‚Äôs overall regarded positively...in fact, many have said they love me when I‚Äôm drunk.
But I wake up the next day completely ashamed and humiliated and not ever wanting to be around whoever witnessed it, again.
I went to a wedding last night and had too much to drink. I danced for hours, laughed, made friends, talked to everyone and in general acted like a person my husband and all his dumb friends wish I was irl. They all liked me more than they usually do.
So why am I so fucking ashamed of myself now? Is it the loss of control? Is it allowing a group of people that I generally dislike, to actually know me and parts of my personality I intentionally keep hidden from them?
Why am I like this? I hate myself."
2197,isfp,"Yeah. I wasn't expecting or ready to be so vulnerable in front of certain people. Sober me would've been perfectly pleasant, sure, but definitely highly self-regulating in those new social situations. Showing the best or weirdest parts of myself to strangers often leads to regret because I usually feel like they haven't earned it and I feel less special."
2198,isfp,"Yeah, I get this too. One time I was drunk and like, comforted a friend who was getting sad in the function; still felt bad afterwards for this reason. Maybe we need to express more truer emotions in daily life, so that it‚Äôs not a sudden shock when we do it when uninhibited? That‚Äôs what I concluded."
2199,isfp,"""and in general acted like a person my husband and all his dumb friends  wish I was irl. They all liked me more than they usually do. ""
‚Äã
That's so fucking sad to read that. Really... that makes me sad. I've got introverted friends and I like them better when they ""really"" are themself, not when they are ""extroverted-induced-drunk"". It's so fucking clich√© to say that but people should like you for who you are, not for whom you're """"""""""""""""""""supposed"""""""""""""""""""" to be. Sorry for the f words, non-english native, but really it upsets me..."
2200,isfp,"Girl, I feel this too well. I was drinking with some friends one night and the host invited her family members and I started the night super shy and composed per normal. Woke up the next to them laughing about how I kept telling everyone I wanted to eat their ass. I avoided hanging out with them and drinking for like a good 5 months because I was so ashamed. "
2201,isfp,"Meditation helps with that in a big way. Do it a couple of evenings before the day. You still let yourself lose, but in a way that feels more true to you."
2202,isfp,"Oh yes, when I lose my shit and say nasty stuff I always end up cringing really hard afterwards once I cool down. Because of that I try to control what I'm saying when I'm angry. Luckily I'm just not a confrontational person irl, but sometimes a comment here and there on reddit happens."
2203,isfp,"I don‚Äôt know...maybe.
I also wonder if being inebriated and less aware of ourselves makes it difficult (if not impossible) to reflect on and analyze our personal interactions after the fact, which is something I do fairly often. Trying to glean perspective or derive meaning or whatever.
When I can‚Äôt remember every little thing about every little interaction with every person I suddenly feel panicky. And then when I do remember stuff it‚Äôs something cringey like slinging my scarf around strangers on the dance floor like a lasso and reeling them in‚Äî- god I hate myself. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòï
Anyway. Do you think you feel embarrassed because you don‚Äôt remember exactly what you said to your friend, or maybe reflected on the conversation later and wondered if you were presumptuous in assuming they needed your comfort? 
I am glad you relate. "
2204,isfp,"sounds about right, i‚Äôm very self-aware normally. I do think there was an element of being embarrassed at losing composure or not filtering myself around other people. This was like two years ago though, and since then i feel i let my guard down with people pretty well over time... I sort of resolved to participate in life more whole-heartedly so that I could make stronger personal connections and memories. That definitely involved less second-guessing of interactions.  
I feel like you could be in the same boat of being subconsciously willing to let loose more? I wouldn‚Äôt want you to bottle up impulses and regret it, and if it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòall or nothing‚Äô like it is with alcohol you‚Äôd still be in control."
2205,isfp,"Agreed. I like your approach, perhaps I‚Äôll try to be less guarded in the future (tall order for me) and maybe I‚Äôm just being so hard on myself in this case because the people I got drunk around are not people I consider friends of mine, at all."
2206,isfp,"Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a good sample.

2207,isfp,Hi CaptainQuint77! I am meeting my supervisor next week and I will be asking whether I can share the overall results on these forums. I have been given permission to send them individually and will put you on that list all the same. But I do hope to be able to share on here as well as I have received a few requests. Thank you for your interest!
2208,isfp,"so I have been warming up to the fact that I am likely an isfp.
I have noticed that I have very strong moral positions on a lot of things, without reasoning them out. For example, I got a letter about West Point, and it made me feel very sad to think about the fact that people want to join the US military, let alone consider it honorable, with its atrocious record of human rights (slaughtering Indians / invading foreign countries for no good reason and stealing tax money to pay for it / etc) and loss of life on both sides, and how we basically live in brave new world.
All the descriptions I read about Fi sound like Ti applied to ethics which I suspect is a misleading description."
2209,isfp,"I would say that it's probably common among ISFPs, considering we are Fi doms. Fi essentially is our own inner subjective moral compass and it's what we use most when approaching the world. Everything will be weighed against it and it's essentially the basis for how we make decisions. "
2210,isfp,"What do you mean by reasoning it out? Like thinking about how you feel about something before thinking about how it makes sense?
But yes, I can't speak for all isfps but it's normal for me. I don't like apathetic people for this reason and get angry over things in the news very easily.
Also, I hate the bullshit descriptions of harmonious, peace-loving isfps. May be true for type 9 isfps, definitely not type 4 isfps.
What do you mean by Ti applied to ethics?"
2211,isfp,"it's the Fi-Ni sync. as an ISFP with the overabundance of Fi, the Ni ends up supporting it. This is why it is so important to energize the Se regularly. Se helps balance out our Fi. At least that's how I see it."
2212,isfp,"I'm not sure how much of a gut instinct it is.  To you it might be a gut reaction, but it honestly looks like your views are quite well thought out.
In your example, you're looking at the moral implications of joining the US military and you see the atrocious human rights abuses they've committed over the years.  This seems to strike a cord with your values.  And your explanation as to why it made you sad actually makes perfect sense to me.
I don't know enough about Ti to really go into that, but it seems to me that Fi isn't less rational than Ti.  "
2213,isfp,my understanding of myself and MBTI is that once I'm left alone for far too long? Our values are are already aligned and the more Ni interjects the stronger our opinions become. Se is there because we need to feel our surroundings and recharge our Fi.
2214,isfp,"I used to think I was INTP, and I act like an INTP without my meds, so I can say that's not a well thought out opinion
This raises a question I have had trouble with, Fi seems like a subset of Ti exclusively for ethics."
2215,isfp,"I respectfully disagree ;)
I would say that they have a lot in common for sure.  It's that they are both introverted, and subjective.  It's just what they're concerned about are two different things.  
http://personalityjunkie.com/05/introverted-feeling-fi-vs-introverted-thinking-ti/"
2216,isfp,"if it was really a wise opinion i would have to break down what the military should do and weigh the ethics of it like an NT
Ti is objective
those descriptions made Ti / Fi users sound like idiots IMO"
2217,isfp,"Not necessarily romantic, but close friendships too. How do you do it?
My Se is pretty well developed so it's hard for me because I'm a very physical person. I miss hearing her voice, hugging, and just being together in general. Phone calls, texting, instant messaging, none of that is ideal. I'd much rather talk face to face in person."
2218,isfp,"I've had several long-distance relationships in the past, and I think the most frustrating part was my inability to comfort the other person. I am not very good at articulating things, and I have no interest in offering words of comfort that seem empty or cliched, so it was very awkward for me to not be able to pet someone's hair and give them hugs when they're upset."
2219,isfp,"I have an ENFP boyfriend and we have been in a long distance relationship for the past two school years due to college. It's pretty rough on me. I'm big on sensing him around me, obviously. Because S. So I struggle with not being able to see his face when we talk or hugging him or even hearing his voice. I have a bit of an issue with texting. But N's, like him, are pretty comfortable with text without actually speaking. So I struggle with getting him to call me or FaceTime me because it's not as big of a deal to him. 
We visit each other a lot. It makes me feel closer to him every time, especially because we have that experience of being together in a city other than the one we grew up in. And you know us ISFPs like experiencing things :)
So yeah. It sucks. But it's worth it when we get to be together. "
2220,isfp,"I'm not too proud of this but.. sometimes I search for connections on the internet, every now and then I'll check /r/r4r , or use this chat-roulette type app called Chatous as kind of a way to meet people like me without having to actually socialise.  The downside is obviously these ""connections"" are very unfulfilling for me since I can't physically be with these people, but they're often enough to suppress my loneliness for a while.  that's my relationship with long distance relationships.  :("
2221,isfp,"People you dislike, bosses who are controlling, people who dislike you, people who hurt you, and difficult people in general? 
First time posting on this sub and a bit nervous asking because it might be a personal question for some of you guys. 
I personally just try to avoid difficult people as much as possible. Once an acquaintance decides to step on my Fi, I start ignoring them and being dismissive of them when they talk to me. If we have mutual friends, they'd have to be understanding of that. Though if a long time friend hurts my Fi, I'm open to a lot of chances and negotiations with them. That said, it's usually not easy to offend me, and if someone apologizes I usually forgive them. I almost always dislike anyone who dislikes me though. For controlling people, I usually just have to put up with them because I usually need something from them until I find something better. "
2222,isfp,"I totally agree with you, I try to avoid everybody and everything that tends to make my life more difficult than usual. But of course this doesn't work for everyone I meet. With close friends who grind my gears, i do my best to play along with their bullshit and don't let them get the better of me."
2223,isfp,"Emotionally cut them off completely. They're not a ""person"" person any more, they just exist. I feel like my phrasing is kind of incoherent. Basically, I stop nurturing the relationship. No more information about myself, no more emotional interest. Grey rock method. "
2224,isfp,"With co workers or bosses who i feel have been condescending, overly controlling, or disrespectful toward me ( which happens RARELY) im usually as non confrontational and as calm as possible. I dont say emotionally charged things but i can tell that when im upset its very readable. I cant help it, i can tell because i Can feel my facial expression and body language etc. I get quiet and terse. I usually try to keep an open mind though and give them the benefit of the doubt because im imperfect and theyre imperfect and our perceptions might just clash or it might just be my ego. So the next day im usually cautious but try to be cordial and open to them. If it happens consistently i avoid that person as much as possible and just act civil toward them if i need to talk to them. "
2225,isfp,"I'll do just like you. I try to avoid them as much as possible. No time, no energy for them. If we have mutual friends, I will make a conversation with one of them when it's possible. I'm not particularly aggressive, however when you cross the line, you've crossed it for good, and you're out of my life. I don't look back on the people I throw out of the window."
2226,isfp,"As someone who is and certainly used to be more sensitive I am quite good at perceiving aggressions against myself and working them up in my head.  I used to do no contact very easily, and cut out acquaintances and friends who had done me wrong as a kind of coping mechanism. This is an unhealthy behaviour that I think I got from my Mom (who I now see as rather lonely, go figure) and is a result of my personality. Now I definitely try to be more accepting, apologetic. For instance in work recently a colleague lied to me about something kind of important. I don't work directly with them much but when I found out they lied to me I was very cold towards them in group scenarios for about a week. I couldn't actually 'help' this behaviour in myself, but eventually I snapped out of it and told myself to forgive him but not forget and moving forward to not give him the chance to lie to me again or call him out sooner. Staying silent and being passive aggressive was a childish behaviour but I think in the past (I used to come out as turbulent in 16 personalities test and am now about 75% A) I would have continued the blocking out and non communication.
It also helps to step back and examine my own behaviour and remember my own failings in the past. I think I used to have a very hard time when people didn't react as I wanted them to, when friends let me down it would hurt very badly and when people were callous to me I would chalk it down to their failings of character. All the while I would never remember how callous and silly I could be sometimes. I lean more towards selfishly thinking about how my actions and other peoples actions affect ME, but as isfps if we exert a little bit of effort we can easily be empathetic. "
2227,isfp,"I believe there's things people say that are open to interpretation but some things are clearly this/that. Mostly on a spectrum though. Like there's this dude that humiliated me on FB, that's clearly not open to interpretation. I ignore him when he talks to me and pretends that nothing ever happened. "
2228,isfp,":( I wanted discussion and to witness the fiSE thought process. Guess I should have just said that lol.
I wanted to post something in the isfp sub and thought of 103821938 questions but none of those were good heh"
2229,isfp,"Uh the thing that bothered me was ""apologetic"". You dont need to be apologetic or accepting to those ""who have done you wrong"". Its fine to be cold towrds them when they dont apologize. 
Its good to know that you arent perfect so that you can understand that others arent either but overall I feel like you should try to stand up for yourself more :) People are callous to you and you can understand where they are coming from but your empathy shouldn't be used as an excuse for their poor behavior. I hope I'm not misunderstanding what you wrote though, maybe you did call them out but didnt write it. 
I personally /try/ to call others out if they behave callously. Sometimes it is hard to do but it needs to be done so that everyone knows that they wouldnt get away with messing with me. I always  try to back it up with undeniable evidence of the persons wrongdoing. If they dont apologize l start ignoring them. "
2230,isfp,"Well, technically I'm not friends with that person (anymore), but they are close friends to my friends so I see them at every event one of my friends host.
An example of playing along with their bullshit: let him listen to his crappy music (on a bluetooth speaker, at a party) that I personally dislike and leave early at said party. So generally speaking: don't cause a fuss if the person isn't worth it."
2231,isfp,"Yes maybe I didn't come across as I had hoped. I used to never apologise, even when I was wrong, which is a stupid stubborn habit I've worked hard to correct. Even in a sort of stalemate situation where it's hard to tell who is really in the wrong I would never, ever, just suck it up and apologise first or break the ice. A cold war of shitty behaviour would always lead to me losing a friend (or, another one I should say.)
I'm not saying I apologise and bend over backwards to make everyone happy, I apologise for my part in the argument and I expect the other person to apologise back for theirs. I would have no issue cutting someone out who honestly deserved it, but what I'm saying is a lot of the time people didn't deserve it. Eventually I realised I wasn't keeping friends long term and didn't have a wide circle of support! It was tie to grow up and take responsibility for my mistakes^^sometimes
As do I. I certainly do if someone is acting nastily to other people. With myself it's a bit harder to call people out because I usually would rather internalise the information of them being a dickhead. As I said though I wish I had said something about my colleague lying, but that's even tougher because it's a workplace, sometimes it's worth it to just keep the peace as you need to keep working there"
2232,isfp,"I usually don't like to leave early at hang outs. I try to somehow have a good time. It can be hard if the person I dislike tries to dominate the conversation though, that's exactly what happened once. But usually if there's more people I'd start having a side conversation with them. Lol, bluetooth headphones are cool though, I saw my friend have one and I ordered one myself from amazon :D But Idk why he would want to listen to headphones at a party, parties are for socializing. Kind of weird/rude. "
2233,isfp,"Hello kindred spirits, 
Anyone here know their enneagram type? 
Do you think your enneatype has influenced you as an ISFP? Has it shaped you in ways that might not be typical of an ISFP? Or maybe shaped you in more typical ISFP ways? 
Thank you for your insight! "
2234,isfp,"I hope answering my own question isn‚Äôt too self indulgent but...
I‚Äôm a 2w1. I think being an ISFP has made me more independent for a typical 2. I think being a 2 has drawn me moretowards love and partnering, for a typical ISFP. I love love a lot and although I need time alone, I feel best when I am in a loving and supportive partnership. "
2235,isfp,I am a 9w1 Which I think more or less is the same as an ISFP in most traits. I don't get too deep into either test really but I like to hang around and talk about it with people that know more than me. 
2236,isfp,"I haven't been able to get into enneagram all that much, but I believe I'm a 4w3 sx. I know it sounds kind of silly, but I feel like the description is almost too accurate, and it freaks me out a little lol."
2237,isfp,"I'm a 2w1 too but not exactly sure what it means, but needing alone time resonates with me, as well as being in a supportive partnership.  I thought ISFPs were intensely independent, so maybe enneagrams are at least as significant in personality as cognitive function?"
2238,isfp,"Maybe? The way I always understood them was that MBTI outlines the behaviours and how information is processed and the enneagram measures the motives that inform the behaviours. 
I think both will influence a person. "
2239,isfp,"I'm a very strong ISFP (meaning I always get it on tests for many years now). 
I've always preferred RPG games. Especially Monster RPGs, like Pokemon I love and am looking forward to Sun and Moon. I also enjoy action RPGs like Skyrim, and Warcraft where you're constantly customizing your character, weapons, abilities etc. I also enjoy fighting games, and pretty much most games that let you use medieval weapons or spells.
I hate racing games, and shooting games also don't appeal to me pretty much at all."
2240,isfp,I think it'd be interesting. Something to keep in mind is that some games will see a large diversity in MBTI types while others won't. I'd be fascinated to see if games that appeal to a diverse crowd succeed or stretch themselves too far and ultimately fail. 
2241,isfp,"ISFP Here! 
This sounds like an interesting study to be had. 
I may really be an (IXFP) but its unclear. 
The games I tend to play most are games like League of Legends and Total war games as well as Counter Strike and Rocket league (all are kind of main stream though) 
Outside of Video games I tend to lean toward your strategy games like Settlers of Catan, Risk, and ""Go"" "
2242,isfp,"I would play more games if I could afford the time and money for it, but I think that's a very interesting topic to think about. I personally am a bit of a strategist, so the good ol' chess, checkers, and solitaire games are enough to keep me plenty entertained. (Sudoku too). But in terms of video games, I really enjoy adventure rpg games and any games involving growing or raising things, like pets or monsters. Although I'd say that's probably due to me playing neopets and maplestory when I was younger."
2243,isfp,"I am an ISFP female. I personally adore playing adventure games (especially LucasArts and other classic/retro adventure games). I love the wide variety these games offer, without getting stressed by high-pace action sequences and quick and precise timing.
One thing I love about adventure games is the emphasis on story and a purpose behind (most) of the puzzles/interactions. I am always looking for meaning in the things that I do (even if that meaning is to have an emotional reaction of sorts), so it‚Äôs difficult when I play a game that does not have a clear purpose behind my actions. 
I also like that adventure games make me think. I absolutely adore logic and having to use my brain. Finding creative, logical solutions is, in a way, a form of art to me.
I like that I don‚Äôt have to fear that any decision I am making will screw me over in the future (unless it is a Sierra adventure game). I can move at my own pace and figure things out as I go (I guess that makes sense, with the whole SP ‚Äúlive in the moment‚Äù mentality). I like that I can pick up a lot of objects and touch and explore almost everything. I get to live out the world I am seeing. It‚Äôs almost as though I get to experience it for myself, which appeals to my Se. But my dominant Fi appreciates the meaning behind each of these discoveries and the way that it advances the plot. 
I also like that these games challenge my tertiary Ni. I am forced to make connections between the objects I observe and the ways to utilize them to advance the game. Also, it forces me to listen for verbal cues (when interacting with other characters) and take meaning from these interactions to gain insight on how to solve a problem. Or even just to gain a deeper understanding of the story (again, my Fi and Se adore that).
I don‚Äôt really like playing mindless games that serve no purpose. I like intelligently designed games that make me feel something. I cannot stress that enough. My favorite games have all made me feel something (even if that feeling is sadness). 
I know I‚Äôm a bit late on this post (and I struggle with being concise, so it‚Äôs gotten quite long), but what I‚Äôm trying to say overall is that I enjoy adventure games because of the blend of exploration, logical thinking, and story, while still allowing me to enjoy all these things at my own pace."
2244,isfp,"So a bit late here but I'm a strong ISFP. I play a lot of Open World and FPS games. Right now I'm mostly playing BF1, Mirrors Edge, Far Cry 4, and the Crew. I think my favorite kind of games are open world exploration games like Far Cry and Just Cause (I've yet to play Firewatch), but my most favorite kind are open World driving games. 
Edit: to name a few more: Just Cause 2/3, The Crew, Red Dead Redemption, FUEL, Burnout Paradise, NFS, Hotline Miami, Trials Evolution. Really I play everything aside from RPGs and puzzle games. "
2245,isfp,"I'm an INTJ. I tend to prefer choice-based games with strong/compelling stories like Heavy Rain, SWOTOR (and KOTOR), Hitman, the Telltale games, Until Dawn, etc....
Though I love platformers like Crash Bandicoot (my favorite game of all time), Limbo, Mario Bros., etc...
I can also play a few good hours of any Tony Hawk game, Guitar Hero, and Fight Night."
2246,isfp,"Oh! I didn't even think before wording it that way. I am sorry if I offended anyone with that. I am well aware that many games that some might consider to be ""mindless"" can be very intelligently designed. When I was referencing liking ""intelligently designed"" games, I was only referring to the games I personally prefer. (I admit that the sentence was poorly placed). That statement was exclusive to the specific sentence it was in."
2247,isfp,"I know that we‚Äôre Sensors, but when I‚Äôm in an unhealthy state or just waking up from a bad morning, I start to get in my own head, which makes it even worse. When I‚Äôm like that, I have to constantly remind myself, ‚ÄúOkay this problem isn‚Äôt that big of a deal. What ____ said or did wasn‚Äôt a personal attack at me. Constantly thinking about this is the real problem. I just need to breathe.‚Äù
This is actually how I first started to get into meditating. After a while, my mind is more clear, and I start feeling like myself again. I often practice mindfulness through playing various instruments (whatever one I‚Äôm feeling at the time) or drawing. Does anyone else do this? 
I‚Äôm also very invested in yoga. It‚Äôs another mindfulness practice that has helped me when I‚Äôm stressed. I‚Äôve done my research and have been told by a therapist (my s/o‚Äôs mom) that stress, trauma, etc can be stored in different parts of the body. When I feel more anxious than normal, I coincidentally feel more tense in my hips and IT band. After doing some yoga, my mind feels almost empty and I‚Äôm off to doing the next thing. 
I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was more common with ISFPs or if it just depends on the individual. Thoughts?
Edit: grammar"
2248,isfp,"I used to vinyasa yoga, I liked it a lot but found it hard to do while working, going to school and lifting, so I stopped. I liked it a lot though, felt great during and after every class. I have heard of mindfulness before as well and it seems like a good idea
I might start again since my gym has some yoga classes I can attend for free, so I might start going once my schedule calms down and I have more time "
2249,isfp,"I‚Äôm somewhat new to Reddit and it is a sombering reminder of how much I dislike debating. I have posted a handful of comments and a few people have seen them as bait to take, which was never the intent behind posting them. It is teh internetz so people are going to disagree with me, especially since I possess some wildly unpopular opinions. 
Anyway, I am okay with not agreeing with someone. I don‚Äôt have to have the last word. In fact, I welcome diversity of thought. Live and let live, right? But I can‚Äôt help but be bothered when people get personal and assumptive in how they respond to my remarks. The assumptive part especially frustrates me. I know. I‚Äôm a delicate flower. 
In-person debating is also spectacularly unfun for me, unless it‚Äôs over something comically innocuous.
Discussion is fine, but let‚Äôs come away respecting and understanding one another. Even better, let‚Äôs end our interaction with some shred of unity of thought!
How do other ISFPs feel about debating?"
2250,isfp,"Once I got angry in a mbti post and damn this INTP had to take every word by word and analyze it ""so you can perfect your argument"". I just stated how I feel, but I guess internet doesn't care as you said. "
2251,isfp,"Same. Debates make me feel uncomfortable.
I'm not good at expressing myself verbally. And I'm also a delicate flower. I prefer having 'good vs bad' discussions or 'what works for you vs me' rather than 'right vs wrong'. Sadly, some people just really can't help but transform everything into a competition or an argument, and they're all over the internet, lol!
‚Äã"
2252,isfp,"Depending on who its with. My bf is intj and he knows how to have friendly debates so im ok with debating with him (although sometimes he steamrolls me because hes more logical and long winded and i flounder about and get irritated).
But most of the time i dont simply because i im not great at organizing detailed thoughts outloud. If there was a debate where could write out my answers alone for 20 minutes each tine i would debate more lol so yeah usually if i have differing opinions that i think will turn into debating i keep it to myself because i know ill fuck it up.
Online tho yeah i tend to jump in and debate stuff sometimes. Idk in writing its a lot easier. "
2253,isfp,"No debater worth his salt will attack  you personally. Did they attack you or your ideas. If they attack you, there as. If they attack your ideas,  and you get insulated, then you should be the one to change "
2254,isfp,"I feel like I don't really relate to this nonconfrontational trait of many ISFPs. I actually really like debating people, and I have to get the last word. However, I only have debates with my friends, or with people online whose views or opinions seriously differ from mine. And even then, I try to keep everything respectful and end it on a good note (while proving that I'm right)."
2255,isfp,"I love debates. Though I seem to think of debates in a different way from most people, as in 90% of cases I‚Äôll debate to challenge my view, not to assert it. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty good at it usually, at least online where I have time to read over and make sure I don‚Äôt lose track of what I‚Äôm saying mid-sentence. Obviously that all works best if the other person is chill and open-minded too.
On the other hand, it can occasionally be fun to debate with a madlad. There‚Äôs something satisfying about remaining calm and conducted while someone else is losing their shit over something minor. But usually it‚Äôs just tedious."
2256,isfp,I agree! Writing it is so much easier than saying it. Doesn‚Äôt it irritate you though when they project things on you that you didn‚Äôt say? Like I don‚Äôt want to spend my time refuting what I never said ‚Äî the words they put in my mouth ‚Äî and get derailed from the meat of the argument. That‚Äôs where I get flustered.
2257,isfp,"This person was projecting things into my post that I never said, nor did I find their ‚Äúaha gotcha‚Äù moments very intelligent. And yes, getting personal by demanding I tell them my stance on something when I politely refused not to, assuming that is my stance when I wouldn‚Äôt tell them, and mocking people with that stance (because he assumed this would insult me). So I don‚Äôt know that I would even call it debating, more like one-sided attacking me and getting assumptive and demanding. With me confused why they were so aggressive and me sorta defending my post, but also not wanting a fight. Then realizing they‚Äôre combative so nothing I say is going to change that. I didn‚Äôt get huffy or immature, as they did, but just stopped replying after some time.
I don‚Äôt choose to debate, but when I accidentally enter into it, I highly dislike it because it is confrontation. Debates never come to agreement or changed minds, so it‚Äôs the disagreement, and discord that I loathe. Not the ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt win‚Äù or ‚Äúget the last word‚Äù part. I like to focus on common ground and understanding. Just curious if other ISFPs are the same."
2258,isfp,"That‚Äôs interesting. It sounds like you‚Äôre a pretty decent writer. I wonder if that‚Äôs an ISFP trait, because I‚Äôve been told that I am by multiple people. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre this way, but I can write all day long (not referring to debating as much now). When it comes to speaking it, I usually struggle communicating my point articulately. Although I have these fluke moments when I‚Äôm in an almost manically good mood and the words flow just effortlessly."
2259,isfp,"Right, i guess its part of the fun for me to make my point as clear as possible. If they arent listening and continually miss what im saying or put words in my mouth then yea its annoying and i drop it bc its useless. But if its just a matter of rephrasing or elaborating for the sake of clarity then i dont mind. My bf is pretty good at just listening objectively to the words im saying and not reading in other things so it makes it nicer to debate things."
2260,isfp,"I‚Äôm somewhat the same way, though I do get tired of writing pretty quickly and it can take a couple sit-downs to get a medium-long debate post written. And as for speaking, I find it pretty hard to get points across unless I‚Äôm really passionate about it. If it‚Äôs an idea I really care about though, I can usually make a clear explanation. I‚Äôve heard a lot of ISFPs talking about having difficulty doing the speak. "
2261,isfp,"hey guys,
so, as the title says, do you have any songs that you find great but seems like no one knows about them ?
It is hard to find those songs because well, youtube autoplay always eventually ends up at pop songs (ehm, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift), aswell as spotify (except this ends up with popular songs for the genre you are listening to).
For me, it would be LP - Lost on You (I know it has got like a fuckton of views, but hhey i didn't know about this song for so long)
PS : I think the best ones are those which when you listen to them, you are like ""ehh I dont know.."" but when you play it two more times you can't stop listening to them :-)
EDIT: no problem with playlists too, or even whole genres ! I mean, f.e Electro swing, It's great"
2262,isfp,"Anything from The Birthday Massacre (goth/alternative rock) or Aural Vampire(darkwave/industrial). There are lots of great songs on both of them, and both are great bands, but I have met only one person beside me who knew of Aural Vampire and none who knew TBM prior me introducing it to them. "
2263,isfp,^bot ^info
2264,isfp,^bot ^info
2265,isfp,"For me:


I'm not really that laidback and optimistic. Sure, I have my moments, but I definitely don't have that hippie attitude lots of other ISFPs seem to have. 


I'm rather lazy and stay indoors often. More of a sensor thing in general, but it seems that most sensors go outside much more. 


While I do enjoy drawing like many other ISFPs seem to do, I only do it like 5 times a year. I want to improve but I can't stay motivated for a long time. 


I'm not really much of an explorer, I prefer walking on paths that were meant for walking instead of walking off-road, following instructions instead of trying things out, etc. Interestingly though, my INTJ cousin is a big explorer.

"
2266,isfp,"For me its that im super lazy and barely do anything. I have tons of half finished diys and i feel like i was cheated in a day if i don't get enough ""do nothing"" time. Im a big homebody and dont like doing sports and outdoor stuff that much. In tons of other ways im a stereotypical isfp tho. "
2267,isfp,"i look at the pace they move and talk at, how immediately responsive they are to their environment and ideas brought up in a conversation, how ""big"" their energy is, how animated their face and body are, how much impulse control they seem to have, things like that."
2268,isfp,"Neurotic ESFP's can seem introverted as they can be scared of failure and rejection. Personally I thought I was introverted but I just think at the speed of light, and I'm scared of failure.
You can also be an highly sensitive extrovert, which may seem introverted."
2269,isfp,"I thought I was an ISFP for ages until i posted a type me post in r/mbti and a few peeps said I was ESFP. Did some more research. Agreed I was ESFP. Went through something emotionally scarring. Saw a psych. Been working on confidence for about 6 months now. Now, so much more confident. And louder.
Aaaand there's my life story.
tldr; yeah bro, I agree :)"
2270,isfp,"I'm not sure about my type at all. I'm torn between ISFP, ISTP, ESFP, ISFJ and least likely INFP.
I share traits of all these types and I sometimes come here because I can kinda relate to the ""chill"" atmosphere of this sub. I also don't fit the ""artist"" stereotype at all although it is said that ""Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they‚Äôre out painting happy little trees.""
Also why out of the sudden a post like this? ""You may not be an ISFP"" seems weird to me :D
It's not like we're some special snowflakes."
2271,isfp,What????? haha ok so you freaked me out there for a minute. Is it possible an introvert could be perceived as neurotic by an extrovert? Neurotic is chronic anxiety and I believe it's no longer a psychiatric diagnosis. An introvert is going to be prone to anxiety if they are in a social environment all day. Ok I lost my point. Ok I remembered it. I was worried I was a neurotic extrovert. Some questions you could ask yourself. Do you generally like books or people better? Are you practical? Do you feel energized after family visits? Ok now I'm having an identity crisis. Ok here's the thing. It's a spectrum so you aren't exactly one thing or another. You are going to tend to go to one side over the other. I'm a neurotic introvert haha
2272,isfp,"I don't like cards, but practical gifts are good - at least in the long run. My boyfriend bought me a pair of headphones for my last birthday and I use them every day and think of him.
I don't know about everyone else, but I kind of hate receiving gifts. Food is good if only because it doesn't seem like it taxes the gifter too much on my account. And I do quite enjoy eating food now and then."
2273,isfp,"I'm a 25 year old INFJ male. My wife, 23, and I have been married for almost 7 years now. We recently navigated a rough patch in our marriage, and since then have been doing much better together.
Still, she suffers through crippling depression. It's incredibly difficult to watch, and at times it can get a bit frustrating. I'm a fixer and problem solver. I want to see her happy and energetic like she used to be. And I just know that's what she wants too. But lately, despite being sweet and loving, she's been sleeping a lot... like.. 11+ hours each day, and has had an extremely tough time doing what she wants to, instead choosing to spend all day inside playing MMO video games the day after excitedly talking about a new artistic pursuit or workout regiment she wants to start. I'm happy to be a good husband and provide for her. But it's just so difficult to see her struggling against her own weight. And even more difficult to find my encouragement can come off as annoying or bothersome to her sometimes.
To make matters worse, communication is a challenge; You ISFP's are so damn silent! In addition... ISFP is a type that I just don't understand at all. You guys love creativity, but absolutely despise feedback on a deep level. And with a mindset that so heavily rewards instant gratification, how are you ever supposed to deal with depression as an ISFP? Fighting depression requires some self discipline and delayed gratification. A trait that I find this type struggling with... And I also find that ISFP's take some odd joy in doing the exact opposite of what you want them to... Even when you're just trying to help. 
Any advice, insight into your ISFP natures, or anything could help. I love this woman with all my heart. She's a beautiful soul. And I want to do all I can to be a ray of hope for her."
2274,isfp,"Oh man. 
I really love INFJs, but they can sometimes be narrow-minded in thinking that they understand people more than they do. Props to you for taking the time to try understand the ISFPs and acknowledge their differences. I can see how a marriage between these two types can be a lot of work. 
That said, depression is so hard to battle. I think the most you can do is to continue to express support and somehow manipulate the situation for her to understand that she CAN make decisions and life choices. She CAN choose. 
The weakest function for ISFP is Te, and that's the one function they will need to exercise when it comes to coming out of depression. Self help books help me work through depression sometimes, I have a list of titles I can recommend if you are interested.
Ultimately, try to pick up on what patterns lead to positive results. It's different for each ISFP. "
2275,isfp,"Obviously you know your wife better than anybody else, but coming from an ISFP who has her own internal struggles (not depression, but still) you need to push her. I don't know how, but she definitely needs it and wants it, but will never ask you. It's up to you to figure out what that push is, but she will be forever depressed (not to say it just goes away, but it can be worked through much easier with help and the right therapy/medication/etc mix) unless she gets help from you. From my own personal experience, I've recently become aware of some un-diagnosed symptoms of BPD in myself among other things. As an ISFP, it's easy to get stuck in your own negativity and wallow. Wallow until somebody snaps you out of it. You're a very loving and caring husband, it seems like, so give her that push. If you see her pulling away instead of doing better, imo, the worst thing you can do is just let her continue on that spiral. If she's anything like me, she won't help herself unless someone else gives her a reason to.
But that's just me and my 2 cents."
2276,isfp,"I'm not an ISFP, but I have some suggestions from an introverted percieving perspective (IxxP).  She may not appear 'approachable' or talkative, but find opportunities to appeal to her senses. Stick with her, be persistent, and show up on her sensing radar. I'd imagine that simply being together and experiencing new things as a pair, especially for a perceiving sensor would help. By being with her I feel that she will understand you support her. In this case the 'feedback' doesn't need to be verbal -- it is shown by action.
More specifically, if she's not busy, maybe suggest going on an outing or a day trip. Going for a walk may help her sleeping patterns, even if it's only relatively light exercise.
I'd suggest that you do ~~less~~* fewer memorable things, rather than being intrusive too frequently and become a bother; or trying to hype things up against her wishes -- not that INFJs are known for such things in the first place! You don't necessarily have to chat with her the whole time, which would probably be difficult and unhelpful for two introverts, nor explain your feelings at length (unlike this comment of mine). Sometimes guiding the process along and being there is enough.
MMOs provide a lot of information to manage, and I'd imagine they're a haven for SP types especially (which have the extroverted sensing function, Se). It can be quite difficult to approach someone in the middle of a session, especially if they're working with a multiplayer group. I've found them fun at times, but more often than not they've been a safe setting to pass time as wounds heal. It seems like this isn't necessarily what she wants, and that she wants to do more wordly things, so help her feel at ease with Real Life. If she doesn't feel ready yet, then I would wait and let her do her thing for a while. This may not be much consolation for a judging type, but I imagine as long as she's physically safe, eventually time will heal her.
This has gotten a bit long for an evening ramble, but I hope this will be readable, accurate, and of some use to you :)

2277,isfp,"For me as an ISFP...I need affirmation. I need to know constantly that I am doing well or that I am loved. For this, I think it is important that you remind your wife that you know she is having a difficult time and that you are there for her with whatever she needs. Don't let this be accompanied by suggestions of what you think she needs. Eventually, when she feels comfortable enough she will (hopefully) come to you with what she needs. If you suggest stuff for her to do, chances are she'll feel pushed or judged. She has to feel it and ask for it. Open the door often though, ""Is there anything I can do for you? Is there anything you want to do today?"" Be wary with affirmation though. When I am in a bad spot and some one is trying to affirm me and comfort me, it has a habit of feeling fake, even if its heartfelt. At those times, my self-esteem is very low and so my mind will try to twist things on its own, so when you go to affirm her be sure that you are being genuine and that you can combat her self-defacing thoughts.
I would also suggest asking her what the things that you do that make her feel loved and the things you do that make her feel unloved. This will help you know how you should proceed with all of these things. What attitudes or mannerisms actually help her pull away from her depression and which ones have no effect or even negative ones. Just beware that she may be hesitant to answer and if she does some answers may hurt, so try to take it all in stride and don't get defensive.
I wish you the best, man."
2278,isfp,"Thank you so much! This was a very helpful comment and I really appreciate your response! Absolutely, I'd love any books that you'd think would help!
As far as the TE thing, I actually had to look that up... Extraverted Thinking right? I actually didn't really know much about this part. But as an educated guess I'd think that TE refers to communication and expressing what thoughts are going on under the hood? 
As far as I go... yeah. Guilty as charged. That's a fatal flaw of mine, and it's something that now I'm aware of, I've been relentlessly working to not fall to. But sometimes in the process of trying to help, I loose touch with myself and forget that I need to be aware of myself too."
2279,isfp,"Yeah. I try to push her in whatever way I can, but it's incredibly challenging to not cross the line of respect, and to know exactly where that line is. I've found time after time that I can definitely show her the door ""suggesting things, expressing my observations, encouragement."" but the second I try using force or coercion of some sort to try getting her to do things, that's when I get into trouble and our marriage suffers a bit. 
Honestly, it's THE single most frustrating part of this entire process, and all too frequently it takes me down with it when I'm metaphorically in the driver's seat and have spent too long watching her and not what I'm doing, we both end up going off road. 
I've found remaining mindful of the situation (not turning a blind eye to flat out unhealthy behavior), and remaining as supportive as I possibly can, and most of all, not neglecting myself has helped push this mess slowly in the right direction...Slowly..
By the way, I super appreciate your comment and insight. It helps me feel a little better and a little more validated for some of my feelings and actions towards the situation. If it seems like I'm arguing with you I'm not. I'm sort of just processing this all in my response to you to kinda help myself. In all honesty, half the time I struggle with ""what to do."" so if anything this is kinda therapy for me."
2280,isfp,"This has been incredibly helpful. Thank you so much. It seems she needs gentle guidance and to find her own way in her own time. Which is exactly what I already knew. I don't know. Sometimes I grow a little impatient and frustrated. But I don't let it take me down to the point where I take it out on her or anyone else I love. Honestly, I used to do that and it certainly made things worse.
I think one of the hardest parts about this is the outside world. My family in particular taking me aside and giving me subtle hints that their worried about me, or that they think she's bad for me because she's dragging me down or something... I hate it when people do that. It's so frustrating because I love her so much and see in her beautiful things that it seems like nobody else bothers to see. She's so quiet, and is often times misunderstood, which is one thing that has led her to this point. Anyways... it can be difficult balancing separating people's hurtful comments towards my wife's condition from us, and at the same time not cutting everyone out of my life whom I love.
(Yes, I'm seeing a therapist.  haha. )"
2281,isfp,"This helped a lot and I really appreciate you taking the time to make such a detailed reply. Really, hearing all of this come from an ISFP gives me some hope. Ever since reading this, I've tried to be more reassuring. Sometimes releasing myself from the expectation of what I think she needs to be doing to help herself can be hard. Heh asking her for what things help her feel loved gets me the usual shrug ""I dunno hunny."" 
I think one of the greater challenges now is feeling like all of the financial and emotional stress is on my shoulders. Making it worse.. Us INFJ's have an amazing talent for neglecting ourselves. So it's a struggle keeping up with myself. The big issue though is figuring out whether to ask her for help, or whether to just trust her to help when she feels she can. It's difficult. Either way your reply has given me insight. Thanks again."
2282,isfp,"It doesn't seem like that at all, no worries! Of course all you can do is just take what I said with a grain of salt. Of all people, you know your wife and what will help her the most. If what you're doing right now is seeing slow, but sure results- then keep at it. You sound like an amazing husband and man and she's very, very lucky to have you. "
2283,isfp,"My wife has depression and it took a lot of changing meds to get her on something that actually helped. It is so weird that 2 medications that do they exact same thing have such different results but its true...If she is having real issues and it seems like they aren't working well, maybe suggest to her doc a change? That is super complicated because you have to wait for her current meds to wean out and the new meds to kick in (which takes weeks) before you know if it works and once that happens it might still be badd, maybe worse, but it may be worth thinking about."
2284,isfp,"I'm sorry it's been tough. Depression is a long road, but it's worth getting through it. Sometimes you just have to trust your own judgement and forge your own path, and I think it's just part of the journey of life. You seem like a wise person -- I'm sure with your presence she'll come right and you'll both live a good life in the end :)"
2285,isfp,"Yeahhh I swear this girl resist every bit of medication she's been on. Both of us have to ""squint"" to notice any changes at all in her condition. We have to schedule another appointment soon so we can try something else,  hopefully it will work a little better. On the last visit the doctor started thinking she might have bi-polar disorder. So getting her the right medication might be a little more complicated."
2286,isfp,"We were together for a year, it ended brutally. I'm not good with emotions nor understanding my own most of the time, i'm sure she already knows me better than i ever will. So my last message was that i forgive her and thanked her for everything she taught me. I don't necessarily agree with the way she went about everything it but i understand why. It's still kinda fresh and her decision is completely ultimatum right now and she don't want any contact with me at this current time and I don't see it happening any time soon maybe forever? concidering how everything went down. We hurt eachother back and forth for a while.. i'm just curious to know if a isfp can ever get contact again with somebody they had such a deep connection with? Even though they literally hurt them til the point of no return metaphorically speaking. Either way I'll focus on myself but I'm curious to know a general thumb on this one."
2287,isfp,"Mmm...from my experience, no. It depends on what you did. Like if you cheated, you could die, be reborn, die again, be born again and I still wouldn‚Äôt take you back. But that‚Äôs just me. If it violated her morals in some way, it‚Äôs a 99.9% chance it‚Äôs a no. But if not, she‚Äôll probably forgive but she‚Äôll never forget and you would have to work really hard to break down the walls she‚Äôs built back up. "
2288,isfp,"Without more context, this sounds like a no. If I shut someone out of my life, they need to earn back my trust, not offer me forgiveness for whatever wrongs I may have done( even if we both did hurtful things, if you‚Äôre the one wanting to reach out you may need to offer a little more that what might be strictly ‚Äúfair‚Äù) For me, being offered forgiveness for a both-fault situation feels condescending and would likely harden my heart to any further interaction. I personally can‚Äôt just exchange sorries and move on, it would need to be worked through and discussed (which it sounds like you guys have already tried to do?)"
2289,isfp,"As an ISFP, it takes me a long time to forgive (if I seem to immediately, obviously I don‚Äôt). However, I never forget. Despite what happened, I will remember specific bits and pieces that seem to repeat in my head. It reminds me of the past, making it hard to simply let go of what happened."
2290,isfp,"Walls went all the way from europe to china, only time can tell if they ever will go down. I leave it up to destiny by now but I won't have my hopes up : ) Do isfp generally move on fast or slow after a deep relationship like generally? "
2291,isfp,"Yeah, she's not as ""strong"" as me when it comes to emotions, I'm pretty cold to be honest. We'll see, we never truely worked it out she was just confused and just wanted it all to end for space i guess because i couldnt let her fucking breath. We will see."
2292,isfp,"Really slow, especially if I really loved that person. It took me two years to get over my first love. But then I happened to meet the current love of my life and I don‚Äôt ever think about him anymore. "
2293,isfp,"Hey, Doyourthing22, just a quick heads-up:
truely is actually spelled truly. You can remember it by no e.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
2294,isfp,"Stating very clearly why you think you‚Äôre wrong and dont ask for forgiveness, only that you want the person to know you realize it was a mistake and is working on changing.  The point of the apology should be to make the other feel better from being wronged.
Although if you dont feel you‚Äôre wrong at all then dont apologize. Anything insincere will just make the ISFP hate you more. "
2295,isfp,"I am currently 16 years old? My hobbies range from experimenting with fashion to researching and listening to music. I don't dread small talk but I'd rather talk about something interesting like art, music, fashion. I have no problem greeting strangers I say good morning and move on. I've been called sensitive by both family members and teachers. I hate conflict whenever I see someone arguing I cringe up badly. I love music whenever I listen to music I get these weird sensations and I start pacing back and forth. Daydreaming is also one of my favorite hobbies as well whenever I go in my room and lock my door I start making up scenarios in my head and or thinking of romantic things to do with my crush lol. I have been called quiet/antisocial by distant  family members but my immediate family calls me talkative and weird. I'm very in tune with fashion. Usually I can visualize outfits in my head which sometimes distracts me in class! I have a very short attention span and if something don't interest me I tend to listen to music or just drown myself in my thoughts lol. I'm very observant and notice social cues easily. But yeah I just wanted to know do i sound like an ISFP?"
2296,isfp,"Sounds like you very well could be but honestly that's not a ton to go on. The main /r/mbti sub has a nifty questionnaire to help people type you.
As for greeting strangers, introverted doesn't mean shy or terrified of people. Hell, I have social anxiety and I'll still say hello to strangers. Greeting isn't the same as initiating a full-on conversation though. That would be less of an ISFP thing to do.
Introversion is how you energize yourself. Extroverts get energized when around people and drained and bored when some. Introverts get drained by socializing (but it doesn't mean they don't enjoy it) and recharge when alone. It's more complicated than just that, but it's not an outgoingness indicator like many assume it is."
2297,isfp,"There are all different levels on the introvert-to-extrovert scale, so it's possible that you're just closer to the borderline between the two. For instance, you said you are very outgoing with your immediate family, but antisocial around extended family.... so you may be one of those who can kinda go between"
2298,isfp,"I'm kind of looking for a second opinion on something, in case I was overlooking something.
I had a crush on a girl for a while, who I'm pretty sure is an ISFP. She knew about it, but she starting dating someone else. I'm okay with being friends instead, especially if it meant we could talk - but she never says anything back. I try to write supportive comments on her art posts online, yet she always leaves me hanging. She doesn't block me either, even though there wouldn't be any consequences. I don't know if she's mad at me, if it's just awkward, or if she's worried that her boyfriend might feel hurt or jealous if she talked to me. I don't really want to confront her about it as if I'm entitled to be her friend... and really I shouldn't have to. 
When I try to talk to her, one one level I'm checking to see if she's ready to be friends. But on another, I'm worried that she's sacrificing a lot of time and energy to make the other relationships in her life work, but no one's really checking to see if she's doing okay. It's kind of like there's a mask there and she's not really putting herself out there like she once did. It's almost like she's putting off dealing with the things that are really bothering her. I'm not really sure what to do about that, especially since it's not really my place to point it out to her. "
2299,isfp,"I'm guessing she wants to make it clear to you that she's in a relationship, and she probably doesn't want to cause drama in her relationship by talking to you. Maybe once she is more secure in her relationship she'll feel ready to talk to you again. Or on the other hand she's feeling annoyed and wondering when you'll get the hint. 
I'd pull back and give her some space. Let her come to you, if she wants to. If not, let her be. "
2300,isfp,"Don't mean to sound harsh OP, but have you considered the fact that she may be a bit creeped out by you? You sound heavily invested in someone who is dating someone else and doesn't/has barely spoken to you.
Maybe I interpreted your post incorrectly, but it sounds like you had been crushing on a girl that didn't really acknowledge your existence, and now she is dating someone else and still not acknowledging you...perhaps this is a sign that she is not interested in any sort of relationship with you, friendship or otherwise?
Had you both been close friends and then she stopped speaking to you once dating her boyfriend, one could say that either she was respecting her boyfriend by not talking to guys that she knows have a thing for her, or that she was simply dedicating all her time to her new boyfriend. 
But the fact you have said that you have 'commented on her posts online' tells me that you are most likely not close to her, or else you would have at least seen her in person or even have her number to message her!
You have stated what you want from her but have you considered that she has to want the same thing for it to be possible? Her not wanting to be your girlfriend, or even your friend, doesnt have to be because her boyfriend or someone else isn't letting her. Maybe she isn't interested in you, friend."
2301,isfp,"I've thought about it some more, and I've come to the conclusion that not saying anything is really putting off a decision. It's just kicking the can down the road, and that could still get her in trouble with her boyfriend if it seems like she's trying to ""keep her options open."" Really, she probably should have said something to me a long time ago - and then we could have talked. I knew she wasn't interested in dating, but it was weird and conspicuous that she couldn't seem to say anything at all. I really don't think her boyfriend has any idea about all this, or else it would have put pressure on her to say something already. 
A long time ago, I figured that even if I had been right in thinking that we were potentially compatible -- the right types -- that doesn't necessarily mean that we would end up with each other specifically. But now I'm getting the sense that's she's just not ready in general. It seems like there's things she's not telling her boyfriend that he should know about, because they are relevant to their relationship."
2302,isfp,"I'm not so sure that security is ever going to come.
The impression that I get is that her boyfriend isn't the sort of person who would ever yell at her or get in her face. But, if he seriously thought she'd considered being with someone else, maybe he might feel hurt or insulted that he wasn't good enough for her... and that could make her feel really guilty. If it's to the point that she can't even have a public, completely non-flirting conversation with me, that's kind of worrying isn't it? 
I have a definite feeling that something's wrong."
2303,isfp,"Yes that's worrying, but honestly I've seen many relationships like that- where people told their partner hey you can't talk to so and so. I would never be with anyone who told me who I could and couldn't talk to, but younger people especially will offten go along with whatever silly rules their insecure partner sets. 
And maybe that is part of what you're sensing? Maybe he's controlling which of her friends she's allowed to talk to? I'm totally guessing, I don't know the guy, I just know I've seen it happen enough times before. "
2304,isfp,"I don't really have reason to think he's saying that outright, but you know how some people can act like a kicked puppy anyway? There's elements that fit a pattern I've seen before. It could be that I'm just being an alarmist though. 
Strangely enough, even though I've been trying to talk to her publicly, I don't think he knows what the deal with me is, or something might have happened already. "
2305,isfp,"FYI this sub isn't very active so your post actually appeared on the first page.
I understand you may feel hurt at a stranger being so blunt, but hopefully it may help you to let go of the idea of someone who doesn't want you in the way you want them, and to get closure."
2306,isfp,"Hey, I don't check Reddit very often, so I just saw this. 
But you ignored things that were already established. So yeah, the scenario you were responding to didn't match the situation I was writing about -- in other words, wrong. You continued ignoring the things I already told you. 
The impression I get is that you want credit for ""helping,"" but you don't actually have any expertise here. You know even less about this situation than I do, and I'm sure you're not even an ISFP. 
Something I didn't put in the original post was that where I'm living now, I'm not originally from here -- she is. She knows the area better, and she has all these local contacts that I don't have. So it's kind of strange that she is so closed off, not just with me, but in general. She doesn't really have a clear reason to be so alienated. For a long time, I thought something traumatic must have happened to make her really self-conscious and secretive, but now I'm not so sure that's the case. I'm not even sure she is an ISFP. 
I think maybe being closed off is just her default state; not saying anything, in order to keep her options open. Something that struck me as odd is that she has a habit of using the Royal We on comments with her art posts. Why use ""We,"" ""Our,"" or ""Us,"" so much if her art accounts are literally just her? If being closed off is her natural way, then it makes sense that she'd probably need to rely on someone else who's more open and forthcoming to hold an audience, like an ISFP maybe. In the past, this might have been an actual person. But now on social media, she's speaking for herself and her own fictional characters who always agree with her. It's kind of concerning. 
When I said before that you replied nearly two weeks after the conversation had ended, it wasn't an issue because of how much time had passed. It was because I'd already figured that it wasn't worth putting the effort into trying to be her friend if she's still hung up on things that aren't even an option any more. The reason I kept coming back was to figure out what that traumatic event was. It doesn't look like was one now. 
So again, at this point I'm thinking she probably isn't an ISFP. The persona she put out might have matched that... but if she has to make a conscious effort to give off that impression, she's just not going to have the energy to maintain that. The real reason she might be so alienated is because she's having to put all her energy into being someone she's not. 
It's frustrating having to spend so much time just to figure this out, but on the other hand, I shouldn't have to do it all over again. "
2307,isfp,"My depression always comes in waves, I'll just be sitting there, perfectly fine, and suddenly everything feels weird and exhausting. I feel distant and trapped inside my own head, decision making is virtually impossible.
As an INFP/ISFP, this is both a good time for me to think and figure out what my mind is doing, and an awful experience because it IS depressing, after all.
Does anyone else with depression do this? Use the hard times to try and figure out what is going on and how you can avoid it? Or maybe, just how to deal with it better or get through it faster?
Please share your mental exercises if you have any! I'd love to know how my peers cope with their depression."
2308,isfp,"I'm not sure if this is an ISFP thing, but I definitely have these waves of depression you speak of. It has gotten to the point that I barely feel happy anymore, and when I do feel happy I always feel like I'm under a countdown to the next ""wave"". I don't think there is anything good about it though. 
When I'm depressed all I can think of is the depression - I'm constantly asking myself why I'm feeling like this, questioning if it truly IS depression, trying to find causes for it, etc. And then I try to think of solutions like for example: leaving the house, riding my bike, working on my assignments... I just quit and stay at home doing nothing because ""i'll get robbed"" or ""i'll get hit by a car"" or ""i'm uncapable of being creative right now"". And I'm aware that these reasons are bullshit, but I just can't force myself to do something because... ???
I also tend to find negative things that are happening in my life right now and ask myself if they are causing it, or if I'm just looking for some meaning. 
As you can see, I basically over-analyze my own thoughts and feelings. Because of this, everything else gets put aside and I don't progress. Sorry if I missed the point of your post, but I just needed to write this down somewhere."
2309,isfp,"I'm the same way. As long as I've remembered I often suffer these sudden waves of depression.
I have a theory that once you go through true major depressions in your life it's like your brain suffers real trauma, an injury.
It's like an injury to your knee. Even if it heals, if you get in a fight again and your knee injury is worked on it will injure much quicker, and more severe than the previous time.
It's the same with depression. Once you've experienced a true major depression one that comes from major loss and trauma you become prone to depression after that for possibly a long while/most of your life afterwards.
I'm all about mental health, exercise, trying to stay healthy etc, but even with all my self work, I still experience random bouts of major depression. I do feel it's because I've just become more prone to it."
2310,isfp,"Coping with your depression will be a lot easier if you can pinpoint your actual type. ISFPs and INFP are very different from one another even though they both use dominant Fi.
ISFPs have auxilliary Se, so even though feelings hit hard and run deep, they don't typically last long, whether they are good or bad. ISFPs' feelings are usually a response to their external environment, so if an ISFP is sad for an extended period of time then it's because something is continually happening to annoy them or remind them to be sad. Going to an unfulfilling job every day. Constantly being around a negative person. Being unable to achieve a personal goal or steer his life in a certain direction for whatever reason. 
Once the ISFP identifies the source of the problem, the solution is easy. Bad job? Change it. Toxic relationship?  Dump it. Unmotivated? Find inspiration. 
Even though ISFPs feel deeply, they're surprisingly simple. Se doesn't ruminate for long. It gets bored.
INFPs are much different. They are prone to long bouts of depression and I'm not sure what causes it or what makes it better. Perhaps you should cross post to /r/infp and see what they suggest?"
2311,isfp,"Please tell me - how do I find inspiration? I'm pretty sure I'm ISFP and I agree to most of what you say (accept for the part of being 'simple' lol) but finding inspiration is not a strength of mine. I have to admit that I don't try many things, which is because I simply get the feeling that I won't like doing whatever comes to my mind.
My ex, who is an INTJ, says I don't like to try new things because I'm not yet good at it and he knows I hate being bad at something. So I agree with that.
BUT the problem is, how will I ever be good at something when the thought of 'learning it first to have fun doing it' scares me off? What if I'll never be good? What if the time I put into it was wasted after all?
Not that easy either, because I feel uncomfortable hurting people.
Recently I figured out that my best friend of 8 years is just tearing me down all the time but I can't just say I'll end this friendship with you because after 8 years of being your ""best friend"" I realized you're not doing me any good."
2312,isfp,"An ISFP who doesn't seek new experiences??? Girl you haven't lived. Engage your Se. It's exhilarating. You don't have to pick up a new hobby or start doing crafts or learn an instrument. Just get excited about something---anything --- and go do it.  Pick up and move to a new town. Or if that's not an option for you, take a road trip or go to a festival or join a local group/team/church/whatever. Whenever I get sad, being sedentary and withdrawn exacerbates the problem. It's a cyclical process: sit around being lazy because you're sad and then feel even worse for sitting around and doing nothing all day. 
You're hauling her around like a bag of bricks. All you gotta do is set it down. 
You think I'm joking about the picking up and leaving part but I've moved several times in my life just to change things up a bit and leave people/places/bad memories behind. 
You could also consider working on the road. I always love that because the scenery constantly changes and you meet all kinds of new people and see new things and never get bored.
I am not sure with you though...I'm thinking our ennagram types are very different or something. You seem very cautious to me, in a way I've never been. "
2313,isfp,"Lol, hey there, sorry for simply ignoring the original post :o
I did think about being an ISFJ after your comment. The last two days I had another look at it and ...I don't know.
Doing the test I always have a high preference for P and get ISFP as result.
Doing the cognitive functions test on keys2cogntive I got ISFJ as my most likely type with 'excellent use' of Si, Fe, Fi and average use of Se.
According to myersbriggs.org the P/J preference shows how you behave in the outside world. So I just copy+paste the statements and tell you what I think about them.
Judging


I like to have things decided. - what kind of things? but I tend to no


I appear to be task oriented. - yes but totally unstructered.


I like to make lists of things to do. - yes but I never stick to it.


I like to get my work done before playing. - I tend to yes because it feels good to have everything done and be able to completely relax but since I'm very lazy I tend to just skip the work part.


I plan work to avoid rushing just before a deadline. - no


Sometimes I focus so much on the goal that I miss new information. - what goal? I don't have any goal I could refer to.


Perceiving


I appear to be loose and casual. I like to keep plans to a minimum. - Idk how I appear but yes to not making any plans if I don't have to. I love being free to do whatever I want even if thats just sleeping or watching tv the whole day.


I like to stay open to respond to whatever happens. - yes, at least I think so. Isn't that the same as making no plans?


I like to approach work as play or mix work and play. - if you can tell me how to do that yes, otherwise, like I said above, I just skip the work part if possible


I work in bursts of energy. - yes


I am stimulated by an approaching deadline. - no, it stresses me out, still I procrastinate almost everything until the very end.


Sometimes I stay open to new information so long I miss making decisions when they are needed. - example??


So if that makes any sense to you, I'd look forward to hearing your opinion. Please point out any mistakes in my writing, English is not my mother tongue and I always like to improve it."
2314,isfp,"Hi, my ISFP friend started acting strange lately. Our conversations have become extremely boring. This concerned me because they're usually very fun to talk to and I wondered if they were going through some sort of issue. They mentioned that they felt I wasn't interested in them anymore and I was perhaps too blunt with my response... I told them ""our conversations have become hard to keep up with and your behaviour is sort of weird lately"". I said this with the intention to start a debate to solve the issue but I accidentally hurt their feelings. ISFPs of reddit, how can I avoid hurting their feelings in the future? I'm used to friends who understand my ""language"" so I hadn't encountered this problem before. Thanks in advance!"
2315,isfp,"Show them you do care, don't just assume they know. What you said probably just confirmed in their own mind that you don't really care much of them as a friend. Maybe they have become boring because they are going through some issues.
Yeah so my advice would be just to show you like them as a friend. Ring them up randomly for a chat or ask if they want to go shopping or something. Anything really, don't over think it and just ignore the strange behaviour or if its really obvious just ask how they are going."
2316,isfp,"It sounds like something is wrong with your ISFP. They might be feeling down or stressed and perhaps your comment hurt their feelings because you approached the situation as something that hurts you and you wanted to problem solve their problems to solve your own problems of them having problems. That‚Äôs a problem. In the future, I would try to approach these situations with empathy, care, and understanding. Respect their emotions and offer help if you can. Help them because they matter and not because they are drag and make sure they know they matter to you."
2317,isfp,"INTJ:  ""our conversations have become hard to keep up with and your behaviour is sort of weird lately"". 
ISFP translation ""Is everything okay? I feel like we are growing apart. I don't mean to act disinterested. What can we do to fix it? Let's go _ (hiking, bowling, etc). 
‚Äã
INTJ and ISFP are activity partners. They can't talk forever - especially not once they know each other well. Do things with your ISFP friend to keep it alive."
2318,isfp,"I am naturally a decent/good student, I hover around B+/A- range for most classes without having to try that much. I know I could easily be getting high A‚Äôs/A+‚Äôs if I really tried but for some reason its impossible for me? I can‚Äôt stand studying as in the moment I find it extremely boring and useless. The problem with this is that as of right now I am trying to major in premed but with my current work ethic in school I do not think it will be possible. Does anybody else relate/have any tips for me? Thanks!"
2319,isfp,"I was a straight A student in high school (struggled in college bc of depression) but I have some tips: 


It helps me to mouth words in text or follow along with my finger at a fairly slow pace so I can process it. 


Internally pretend that you‚Äôre a teacher teaching yourself or someone you care about (I know this probably seems weird) 


This is hardddd with boring material and I‚Äôve only successfully done it a few times, but tune in to Se so hard that you‚Äôre just so completely enthralled in the moment and subject of the lectures. Did this a few times in high school before knowing what Se is


Helps to be doodling during lecture or making notes pretty if possible 


Fidget spinner 


Give yourself time to not rush


It‚Äôs extremely important for our type to feel secure in school so don‚Äôt beat yourself up for performing subpar in the past, try to have a positive and excited attitude

"
2320,isfp,"Literally me man. I don‚Äôt wanna be all like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm great‚Äù cause really, I‚Äôm not. But I never every try and I sit at decent grades. Like, above average but nothing special. I just don‚Äôt care enough to do anything else. I‚Äôm so lucky I can get by naturally cause honestly I would‚Äôve been screwed well before this point.
I personally haven‚Äôt found any way to persuade myself; but from an ISFP point of view, you just gotta find a way to enjoy it. Cause if I care about something enough I‚Äôll give it my life. I just don‚Äôt care about school so uh yeh, it doesn‚Äôt get any more of me than it needs to. Just try your best to find interest in what you‚Äôre learning."
2321,isfp,"I was like that in highschool, I could get by doing minimal work, minimal homework, always aced every test, kept my grade at just above failing, maybe wasn‚Äôt the smartest thing cause English class depended too much on homework so I had to do summer school once or twice, but that wasnt the worst experience. Got to stay home while my family went on vacation and I think they thought I wouldn‚Äôt like that, ended up being some of the best summers of my life. 
I tried going to college for a couple courses, started with community collage to try and just get the basic boring stuff out of the way then get in to more specialized schools or classes, but that all never happened, I hated college and could never force myself to do any of the homework so I dropped out, maybe tried twice, both times dropping out in that first semester.
I have a job at a student loan agency processing paperwork and sometimes taking calls, it‚Äôs not at all what I thought I would be doing but I have job security and benefits but it‚Äôs not a very thrilling job and honestly sometimes I downright dread doing it because it‚Äôs as boring as all that schoolwork was. But at least I get paid for it now. 
Sometimes I dream of going back to school to try to be a mechanic or something but I am just too complacent, too unenthusiastic. Sure, I might have been ‚Äúhappier‚Äù making more money or doing something I actually enjoyed, but honestly I feel happy now. Maybe it‚Äôs because i have a loving wife which makes things a lot easier and also the double income, but I am perfectly content to just waste away keeping myself entertained in my downtime and working just hard enough to not get fired. Retirement probably won‚Äôt be fun, but honestly nothin is ever fun, my fun is just being able to turn off my brain with a hobby for unhealthy amounts of time.
It‚Äôs up to you in the end. You know how things will go no matter what you do, and if your future isn‚Äôt one that scares you it‚Äôs hard to say you‚Äôll do anything to avoid it, even if others don‚Äôt consider it ideal. If you find something you‚Äôre passionate about the passion will be your main motivator in everything you do, but without it you may as well just figure out a good routine you‚Äôre happy with for the rest of your life, and maybe somewhere down the line you‚Äôll find it. From my experience, trying to force passion just seems to make it harder to find."
2322,isfp,"in most subjects I just don't care enough to put too much effort in, so i usually get B's. in one case I got a C because I was absent a lot and missed assignments frequently. I was actually quitting school at that point but decided to keep that class since it was fun and I had time for it. 
in classes I really like(like art or foreign language) I have no trouble getting A's, I just find it a lot easier to stay interested and pay attention so it's not too surprising. if it's something I don't like or don't understand well like math or some sciences then I usually struggle to even get a C."
2323,isfp,"Yeah I was like this aswell. And I must say even though i am very happy with where I am it would not have hurt me to try harder at school. Doing the work then, building routines and discipline early makes it easier later. But that being said. With the subjects I liked I did a lot of work in. I am sorry I dont have tips. All the best."
2324,isfp,"If it's because u find it boring & useless u gotta try and flip it around and make it it interesting and useful for you! 
Actually I believe practicing finding ways to be interested and making things interesting is one of those most important skills to have.  üòé 
Good luck with school!"
2325,isfp,"I want to know what kind of quotes ISFPs resonate with deeply. 
For me, I love Eckart Tolle quotes about the present moment, the human ego, inner peace and stuff. His book, the power of now really changed how I see the world and made me way less depressed. 
Also I like Lao Tzu‚Äôs quotes with water metaphors. 
‚ÄúWater is the softest thing yet it can penetrate mountains and earth. This shows clearly the principle of softness overcoming hardness.‚Äù
Other honorable mentions include Rupert Spira‚Äôs quotes and Rumi‚Äôs poetry. "
2326,isfp,"‚ÄúThere are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.‚Äù
‚Äï Patrick Rothfuss, The Wise Man's Fear"
2327,isfp,"Just wondering what goes on with my fellow ISFP's. For me, I constantly have music stuck in my head 24/7, sometimes makes it hard to think or focus on other things. When I'm at work, I feel like I don't think too much, but my current job is pretty mindless, so I guess that goes with it. I feel like I think a lot better at night, and it's usually just me thinking about where I am in life, and just other thoughts about myself. I feel like I think about myself too much in these moments. I feel like I don't have a lot to offer in conversation at times cuz I think about myself too much, but when I'm around friends, I don't want to keep talking about myself too much. I def think better by myself, wish I could be as quick or clever when I'm talking in person, I feel like I am a little bit wittier when talking online to friends.
There are other times where I fantasize about being the life of a party in situations with friends and stuff, and sometimes that does come out since I'm pretty animated, but usually I'll just be normal.
Hmm I guess I got a little off track with this post haha, but, what do you think about during the day, and what do you think deeply about?"
2328,isfp,"I'm stuck in my head for probably 95% of my time. I think about MBTI, I think about my piano teacher, I think about my friends, I think about my personality, I think about how I come across to others, I think about the larger scheme of things and where I fall in it. I think about people and might ponder over something someone said to me.
Most of the time though, I'm thinking up random specific scenarios about some event that might happen in the future, and probably project myself into it. I'm quite imaginative, but my imagination is still kind of grounded in reality. I also get music stuck in my head sometimes and my mind often comes up with many wonderful artistic ideas. "
2329,isfp,"Similarly to OP, I have music stuck in my head all the time. I do a lot of self-analysis. I'll do something, and then think about what I'm doing or why. I also do the opposite where I'll zone out or start going down a rabbit-hole of thoughts, usually if I'm doing something repetitive. If something happens and there is a reaction that is expected of me (even if it's the reaction I want to have) I will generally think about it first...which makes it feel kind of forced.
In conversations, if I'm talking about something I care about I can sometimes get ahead of myself and my thoughts and need to back track to regain my thoughts (sometimes embarrassingly so). If I'm in a group or awkward situation, I'll generally go into my head and think about stuff, sometimes it's about the conversation and other times it is just random thoughts.
My relationship with God is also important to me, so I try to devote a lot of my mental energy to praying and things of that nature."
2330,isfp,"I'm not an isfp, but you guys are interesting to figure out, like there's this secret, hidden life. Plus, being so emotionally in touch (starting lots of sentences with ""I feel..."") is a different perspective "
2331,isfp,"same same all same. at night I just go deep into a rabbit hole, thinking about myself in the future a lot, like my conversations with people which I want to have (or happen to me, because introversion) I think about my relationships with others again, and where I want it to go. every time I think more than I do. 
I want to write more but wont"
2332,isfp,"Not sure if I'm an infp or isfp, but I'll go anyway.
Wake up feeling super groggy. Think about how groggy I feel. Start thinking about thinking, maybe remembering what I dreamt about last night. Think about past dreams, and compare them. In the car, daydream about the future. Think about all my flaws, and about why I am the way I am. Think about the lyrics of a song. Get song stuck in my head on loop. While working I start start waking up a little and daydreaming more creatively, about stories and things I want to draw. Think about food. Think of jokes, songs, interpretations of things. Maybe start thinking about how humanity is screwed up. Realize that I'm moving my lips, and feel awkward. Curse myself internally for being awkward. Think about something embarrassing or horrible I did in the far past that I regretted. Think about what I want to eat. Think about boyfriend and ponder the health of our relationship. Daydream some more about future scenarios, and hypothetical conversations I might have with others, or even if I was talking to myself. Bounce ideas back and forth, sometimes replying to my own ideas with better ideas. Think about the things I know I'm good at.
The list goes on and on."
2333,isfp,"I run scenarios in my head about things I want to happen, many how I would act in a situhation. Then I also think about my work (I am a final year Physiotherapy student), and also I run pc game scenarios in my head (I play MOBA games so every game is diffrent and I can spend my time running the same combination of characters with diffrent outcomes based on how every player could act in that scenario). And then I also think about funny things: jokes, movies, series etc..."
2334,isfp,"Wow, thank you for sharing. It's nice just reading up and seeing that other people are really like me as well. How would you say you are in conversation? Me personally, I feel like when I am in the mood, I do like talking to people, it's just I'm not good at leading a convo, and sometimes just don't end up knowing what to say, and wait for someone else to contribute."
2335,isfp,"Ooo so you think about your reactions? I feel like I act without thinking when I'm in social situations, but then once I'm out of it, I'll think about how I could have handled something better, or conveyed anything I said better.
In convo's, I'm totally with you. I had that problem a lot, but I have gotten better with it. I try to think, does this person know what I'm about to talk about, or just try to gauge the person's interest level. If they seem more interested in the topic, but don't know any info about it, I'll give them a framework and describe pieces of what I'm about to say, then get into detail after that. I feel like that's helped convey my points a bit better.
That's great you have a good relationship with God! That is something I wish I was better at, my parents raised me religious and I do go to church as often as I can, almost every weekend, but I don't contribute to helping out there as much as I'd want to."
2336,isfp,"I can relate. It's sometimes too hard to start conversations and I don't really like making small talk. And when I'm talking I'm being overly conscious how I say things and how they would affect people, as if my words are going through many filters. I worry about making situations too awkward. So a lot of things end up remaining inside my head. Sometimes I wish I was an intuitive, just so I could speak what's on my mind without being overly aware of the present conditions."
2337,isfp,"Oh, I definitely do this too haha"
2338,isfp,"last night I actually stayed up until 1 thinking about stuff. not doing anything just thinking in the dark, sometimes I'll listen to music but will quickly zone out the music.
it's a problem sometimes when I need to get sleep it negatively affects me because of it making me stay up, last night was really bad, because it was making me kinda sad/depressed. idk, I just feel like I need to talk about it to someone"
2339,isfp,"I absolutely suck at flirting. I‚Äôm a chronically platonic person, and treat those I‚Äôm attracted to with the exact same general friendliness I show every one else. I‚Äôm almost 18 and have never even been on a date, and tend to get spooked/creeped out when guys clearly hit on me. I had a crush on this dude, but found out one of my best friends liked him, so I definitely set them up and they‚Äôre going on a date this weekend. I‚Äôm honestly fine with it because she had no way of knowing how I felt and I certainly wasn‚Äôt going to act on it, knowing myself. Plus they‚Äôre pretty cute together! But do any of you kind of stuggle with flirting/showing interest in others?? Or, if you don‚Äôt, how have you gotten past your introversion?"
2340,isfp,"If I like someone I don't have a problem flirting and sending hidden messages. The problem is when I don't like them, it's like a 0 to 100 feeling. I want to give the people I love a good experience/feeling you know?"
2341,isfp,So I never had a girlfriend until college and I'm married now. I'm a guy but in college I learned to flirt by being nice to everyone equally but to the girls I thought were cute I would work at when taking to them and make sure sure if small physical contact. 
2342,isfp,"Eye contact. Smiling. Smiling flatters and encourages men to be bolder. Be genuinely curious about them. Figure out what their interests and passions are and ask them questions about that topic. Ask more than just a couple things about that topic. Get in depth. Try to understand and learn something from them. It‚Äôll take the nerves off if you see the conversation as a learning opportunity and help you to act more natural. Dead silence? Ask more questions. Family? Pets? What breed is your dog? Is the dog well behaved? Show me a photo! Does he like new people? Act impressed if something is impressive. ‚ÄúWoah, really?‚Äù ‚ÄúI would have never guessed!‚Äù Laugh at their jokes. That boosts ego and feel-good feelings. Don‚Äôt reveal everything at once. Be a little mysterious. Wait for him to ask questions about you. Share a bit about yourself too! Avoid negativity or gossip. Speak highly of other people. Keep your mouth shut about the people of whom you don‚Äôt want to speak highly. Read a bit. Keep up on the major current events. Have opinions. Express said opinions in a way that encourages agreement, but also diversity of thought if they don‚Äôt agree. Mild teasing can be a bit flirtatious and fun, but perhaps test that out to see if the person responds well to it or not. Don‚Äôt be a know-it-all. Let minor incorrect statements slide. Or find a humorous, non-naggy way to counter that statement. A touch on the arm or a hug can help.
Just a few pointers. Maybe you do some of these things already. The biggest thing I find that helps is to not run out of questions. If you become genuinely interested in getting to know people, and people are very fascinating, you won‚Äôt run out of things to say to people. So, create a mindset of curiosity! Pretend you‚Äôre a journalist (but keep that to yourself, haha). 
Although, I will couch all of the above with this: if you‚Äôre trying these things out with someone and they‚Äôre not receptive, you should ask yourself whether it‚Äôs worth spinning your wheels on a one-way conversation. Do you actually still like them?"
2343,isfp,"If someone initiates flirting with me, I am a little awkward. Usually I am open to considering dating anyone so that is not the issue, it's just switching into ""flirtation"" mood/mode.
‚Äã
If I am attracted to someone I will be comfortable flirting unless they give confusing signals in return. Then I just stop, even when the most rational thing would be to say, ""I like you, wanna go out?"" and be respectful if they don't."
2344,isfp,"I have another comment too. Why did you set them up? You liked the guy. Maybe they would have ended up going on a date anyway, but didn‚Äôt you want a shot? You may have had a chance with him before, but you have less of a chance now because your friend may get in a relationship with him or maybe she won‚Äôt want any of her friends to date him if it doesn‚Äôt work out. He‚Äôs ‚Äúclaimed.‚Äù Sorry, not trying to condemn your actions. I just can empathize with you because I have done the same kinds of things when I was younger. And I realize I don't have all the details of your story -- I just hear 'I liked this person, but set them up with someone else...' And that hurts my heart!
I know loyalty to friends is important, but you still can be just that without invalidating your own feelings. I wouldn‚Äôt voluntarily give up my chance with someone just because a friend spoke up first. Also, just a general piece of advice ‚Äî be careful who you talk about crushes with. I know you didn‚Äôt tell this girl, but I would also be careful allowing friends in your circle to discuss their own crushes at length with you. Women and girls can act funny about available men. We get possessive and start ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù them. It can lead to a lot of hurt feelings, stress, and unnecessary competition. Oh and it‚Äôs really awesome when some women like every guy and start ""calling dibs"" on all of them (sarcasm)...then who's left for you if she's interested in ten dudes? Just be choosy about who you talk about such things with. Maybe there‚Äôs someone from another school or a friend who lives out of state you can talk to about your crushes and vice versa... that way you're not risking overlap of romantic interest. Or even your mom who can‚Äôt date your demographic, haha! That last one depends on your relationship, obviously. 
I‚Äôm 32, and all this is said with much love and experience. :)"
2345,isfp,"Lol thanks for all the advice! :) I don‚Äôt usually talk about crushes with people anyways, it‚Äôs mostly my friends who tell me üòâ. I set them up because she had no way of knowing, and I absolutely love her and wouldn‚Äôt want to prevent her from going for it, as I know myself and that I definitely wouldn‚Äôt go for it. Plus he very obviously liked her. We‚Äôve actually become pretty decent friends, and he‚Äôs absolutely crazy about her (he‚Äôs honestly way more invested in this than she is). But yeah, he‚Äôs making my friend happy, so I‚Äôm cool with it!"
2346,isfp,"wow. I know I‚Äôm younger, but I genuinely feel the same. I‚Äôm definitely happy for those around me, but there‚Äôs a certain level of soul-crushing-ness to it that‚Äôs kind of constant. It‚Äôs irritating because I know I could get in a relationship if I actually tried, but I don‚Äôt want to make anyone uncomfortable if they don‚Äôt feel the same about me so I never even attempt to flirt lol."
2347,isfp,"It‚Äôs strange, because ISFPs tend to seem fairly social (for introverts), but most of the ISFPs I know irl are kind of chronically single as well... maybe we‚Äôre not designed to be in steady relationships? :P"

But wow, when I have an Fi-fueled Ni session (using Ni a lot becuase I Fi care about it), I'm super proud of the Ni use and I notice it more.
I also think it has to do with American culture (moreso when I was young); being seen as an emotional male wasn't cool so I wanted to be and appear more logical/intuitive."

2365,isfp,If there was a slider that slides from femininity to masculinity. I would say that I am attracted to people that are near the center of that slider. Possibly leaning towards femininity. Not sure. So to answer your question. Yes. I find the extremes of either being very unnatractive.

2367,isfp,Prefer cuddles more but neck kisses aren't bad. Just neck kisses can make me feel like I'm suffocating sometimes for some reason. I wish my fiance didn't hate feet so much cause I wanna rub our feet together sometimes.
2368,isfp,"I feel that culture is everything, every interaction, every influence. All cultures are constantly changing and morphing, it's a dynamic thing and the blending of cultures should be celebrated. It's cool to appreciate the lost cultures of the past however I feel that efforts to preserve dying cultures are wasted. I think people can be too precious about how sacred their culture is. I know this is a controversial mindset but I grew up in a very multicultural town and am so greatful to have been able to experience and embrace the cultures of my friends. Despite not being born into their cultures, I feel that they are a part of my own."
2369,isfp,"it could be anything, music, clothing, religion, art, any external aspects of culture that you find significant towards your own life. i listen to a lot of music and it's shaped me as a person; even though a lot of my music comes from people from very different backgrounds, it's important to me and i'd consider it part of my cultural identity"
2370,isfp,Do you think ISFP would excel as a doctor/nurse? What about an ER doc? XD These jobs are helping others..but might so stressful it would be hell. But I think nothing would be worse than manager. What do you guys think?
2371,isfp,"I have a list of jobs I would consider, every time I find something new I add it to the list 
NatGeo Photographer 
MotoGP Rider
Sailor
Cowboy 
Adventurer 
Explorer 
Bartender 
Cameraman 
Lifestyle Photographer"
2372,isfp,"I am a scientist and I can tell you that it might be unfun in the long run. It depend a lot of what you want to be professor in I guess. I often find myself thinking about things and reading about things that has nothing to do with my current job....at work. I can basically waste an entire week doing this. It's not a good feeling tbh. But if I find something interesting from anything....from other ppl or from television I have a tendency to google it and trying to find out a lot about it. Then I grow tired of it....and I search for other inspiration for my senses. I think I have become a sense-junkie. Constantly looking for no dangerous thrills for my senses. (I dislike thins that are dangerous, but war history does not count as I only read about it and not participating )"
2373,isfp,"I'm 24 and I feel so lost when it comes to what I want to do as for my career. I feel like friends around me have already  somewhat kickstarted their careers and have kinda figured out what they want to do, and I feel like a loser. I feel like I'm getting older and at this point, I should know what I want to do and work towards it, but honestly I dont even know where to start. I have a lot of passions/hobbies and talented in the things i have passion for (isfp thing?), but I don't know how I feel about making them my full time career. I get burnt out/bored easily on passions when there is pressure put on them like making money, etc.And I am someone who always second guess myself and think i'm not good enough because im superrr critical of myself
‚Äã
What are my fellow isfp's jobs right now and how do you balance your job and passions? Did you make your passion your job or do you keep them separate?"
2374,isfp,"ISFP, 27 - I'm an engineer, but when I'm home I read and write psychology. The stable engineer pay helps ensure that my artwork is not affected by the pressures of money.
You just gotta try different things if you don't know what you want. Primary Fi will help you decide what you like and dislike. And when you find something you like... Find a way to practice it, even part-time!!"
2375,isfp,"I'm a web designer, when i finished studying i realized i hated it, because i had to satisfy client shitty demands all the time, so then i did an entire IT carreer, when i finished it i realized i hated that even more, i disliked the enviroment.  
So i'm 30 y/o now and i'm taking charge of my dad's business now, i never thought i would be doing this. I don't dislike the job but when i get out everyday i do my own things ;D"
2376,isfp,"I was in sales. I hated it and was awful at it 
Now I‚Äôm a law student. Not sure if it‚Äôs quite right for me. I love helping people, but it‚Äôs a very rigid profession and 70% of lawyers are ESTJ. I hope I can be successful. The study is very interesting, but the cut throat environment is demoralizing 
At the end of 1L year, I discovered that my true passion is psychology. Had I known that sooner, I‚Äôd have skipped law and instead go for an LMHC. I think I‚Äôll still do it though and maybe become a counselor for lawyers and law students, or get into expert witness testimony "
2377,isfp,"My source of income is my IT job as a Business Analyst. I don't love it but it pays the bills and allows me to work on a flexible schedule at home. And because of that, I'm able to volunteer for a mental health organization which fills all the meaning and fulfillment I cannot find in my job, lol!
Don't worry about feeling lost and scared to start. I think as ISFPs, it's hard for us to not feel bored doing just one thing. The important thing is we allow ourselves to try those that interest us. While it feels great to be an expert, vertical growth and longevity in one role aren't always where success lies. 
Just get yourself out there! You'll be fine :)"
2378,isfp,"Right now I‚Äôm working at a daycare with 2-3 yr olds. Never thought I‚Äôd be doing this, as I‚Äôve never been one who is good with kids. Turns out I am, not the best, but I‚Äôm not as bad with them as I expected myself to be. But this is just temporary, my plan is to go to school for sonography (ultrasound). I think doing ultrasound is like, a perfect mix of my talents and interests and goals. 
On the flip side, my parents used to encourage me to pursue art. I‚Äôm really good at art, I like doing it, but it‚Äôs my hobby and doing it as a requirement is not fun for me. I get orders on Etsy for drawings and while I enjoy doing them cause it‚Äôs challenging, I could never do it as a full time job. I‚Äôm not the kind of person who can turn my hobby into a job and enjoy it. It just sucks the fun out of it."
2379,isfp,I feel the same way. I deliver pizza and manage at a Papa John‚Äôs. I feel like I‚Äôm the odd one out of all the other managers there though. I am also in school. I have the same struggle with deciding where I am going to go next and sometimes it overwhelms me to think about it because I don‚Äôt want to stay making pizzas forever. 
2380,isfp,"Homecare nurse. I absolutely love it. I love the elderly and I love working one on one with no coworkers and I only know my supervisors through their voices on occasional phone calls. My passions include helping others which I obviously do at my job, and I make time outside of work for my sports/dance/acrobatics. "
2381,isfp,"Honestly, I used to feel the exact same way...just feeling lost in life and lost in which direction to take with my career. I always felt so much fear in possibly ending up on the wrong path.
The best advice I can provide is to just go out there and apply for jobs. Experience is the best way to figure out what you like to do and also for figuring out what you are good at. Make a list! Also, stop comparing yourself to others! Everyone is at different stages in their lives.
I didn‚Äôt find my passion until age 24. I‚Äôm currently a flight attendant and I‚Äôm in love with my career. I love the constant changing environment, the sense of adventure, being able to meet new people all the time, and learning new cultures. Through my past experiences, I learned that I‚Äôm really good at customer service and enjoy learning about safety. I wanted a career that allowed me to help people but I did not want to be in a constant depressing environment (example: nursing). So just go out there and through each experience you will get one step closer to a career that works for you. Even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, it‚Äôs a learning experience. 
I‚Äôve also learned to stop mixing business with personal. When you are at work, you are there to work. It may not always be a joy but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs work. Learn to find something that is bearable and not soul-sucking. For other things you are passionate about but not related to your career, do those on the side. You may also make a side-business out of your other hobbies if possible. Otherwise, just enjoy your hobbies on the side.
I wish you best of luck! I remember how stressful it was so if you need someone to talk/vent to, feel free to reach out :)"
2382,isfp,"Software engineer, former esports coach.
I'd say I usually drive work from my passions, which either works out extremely well or burns me out rather quickly. Over time I've learned that if you plan on making work your life, you'd better have some really relaxing hobbies."
2383,isfp,"24 as well, I just started working private security last month. Before that I mostly did retail and warehouse/stock stuff, which was alright but not a good fit for me. 
Security is good for me because I'm a pretty tall dude and I'm fairly polite, but at my current job none of that is super important- for the most part I watch cameras or patrol a facility in a car. I mostly work graveyard shift and don't interact with anyone other than a few co-workers. Lots of my co-workers are the opposite of intimidating, so don't worry about trying to fit a stereotype if you're ever interested in this job. 
When it comes to full time career, I want to do something else. Currently looking into becoming a firefighter or possibly joining the military if the firefighter thing doesn't work out. Last year I spent some time studying to be a certified personal trainer, but I haven't studied for that in a while. I might get around to it eventually, but I'm not sure I'd like it.
I never got a degree and probably will never get one, so anything that requires one is off the table for me. I tried for several years in community college, but I just couldn't succeed there. For a long time I was depressed about this, but lately I've started to realize it doesn't matter and I should be doing something physical since that's what I'm best at. I would have loved to be an art or language teacher though"
2384,isfp,"I am a pastry chef. When I was a kid, I always wanted to open a bakery, & I eventually did. It is one of my passions. I also make time to draw & sing. I've always worked enough to get by with some spare cash to do whatever I like, without working so much that I push my interests aside. I don't need to be rich. I just need to be alive & happy. Good luck to you!"
2385,isfp,"I (25F)  just finished my job as a carer for a girl with SMA. Now I‚Äôm starting a new job as a nanny.  I find these jobs suit my needs on a moral level as I feel like I‚Äôm having a real impact on people‚Äôs lives and I‚Äôm not selling myself out. 
But I always have hobbies to keep me going and fulfilled. Right now I‚Äôm getting into ethical, plant based fashion design, and oil painting.  "
2386,isfp,"I'm 27. For the last 3.5 years I've been working as a data analyst, and about a year into it I realized how much I don't like it. I've struggled through it because it's a ""real"" job as society sees it and I guess I didn't know what else to do. So a few weeks ago I finally got the courage to quit! Honestly I feel so free, this has been the best decision ever. At the end of this month I'll be done with it. 
I don't have a new job yet but I'd honestly be happy working as a shop assisstant or waitress for a while and just be doing something rather than thinking so much. Also interacting with people more. As much as I'm introverted I love to be around people. 
My plan though is indeed to turn my hobbies into work... I don't want to become dependent on any one of them as I still want them to remain fun, and I don't want to take the passion out of them. I am a silversmith so would love to teach that, give piano lessons. And I want to to a yoga teacher training this year and teach. I'm hoping to find a balance between all of them and I think the variety is good so that I don't get bored of any one thing. (is that an isfp thing?). Also I want to teach english to kids, I got certified last year :) 
Also, I just want to say, take it ease on yourself. I've struggled with the feeling that everyone around me has their shit figured out except for me but honeslty, it always looks better than it is from the outside, you don't really see their struggles either. And even if they have figured it out and you haven't, that's totally fine. I think that there's only a handful of people that are lucky enough to know exactly what they want to do, for the rest of us you kinda just go with the flow until you find it. It's hard to accept but hang in there - who says we need to have everything figured out and by when? It's just unneccessary pressure we're putting on ourselves. And actually I think that once the pressure is off, you will actually find what it is that you want to do.

2387,isfp,"man, i'm really happy to read this, i see a lot of people depressed in this sub.
it's cool to see a ISFP engineer, i see lot of people getting caught in the trap of the ISFP as unable to have certain profesions
‚Äã
would you mind sharing some artwork?  :)
sry for the poor english"
2388,isfp,"Another dentist here. The variety of work as a general dentist is nice to keep things somewhat fresh. It‚Äôs also nice having the ability to work 3-4 days/wk so I have time for my incredible amount of hobbies. 
The only problem is the amount of student loan debt, which I‚Äôm working long hours to pay off as quickly as possible."
2389,isfp,"I'm glad you were happy to read my comment :D
I think the best weapon of an ISFP is that Se auxillary helps us notice change and adapt accordingly (as long as it is in line with values). I think we can be good at any introverted profession (even if we don't enjoy it), but if the profession matches up to Fi, that's when sparks fly.
By artwork, I mean my writing...
I can share a poem that I wrote for my book... Hope you like it:
The body is the vehicle,
Traversing the fourth dimension,
In present and in forward motion,
Experiencing every moment."
2390,isfp,"Hi, I seem to attract ISFP females alot, and I am attracted to them as well, but the thing is, it's hard to get the conversation going. Everytime I meet an ISFP at a party or social setting, it's like oil and fire, I can feel this fire growing inside both of us, but since I don't want to come out as too eager, I do the usual small talk, which usually backfires. You guys literally stare the shit out of me and not say a single word, but your body language and smile tells me you are very interested in me, but I don't know how to get it going in a normal sense. I've slept with ISFP girls before, but it was when we were both high out of our minds either from alcohol or other drugs, and the next morning the same thing happens where the conversation gets kind of frozen and stalemate, and we both end up thinking we made a mistake. ISFP seem to see me as who I am (I look strong and unrelenting, but ISFP sees my soft side) I don't tell my friends that I like dogs, or that I am interested in art and dancing, or that I am secretly a closet nerd, but without a word, ISFP knows that I am that kind of person inside, but the only time I actually open up is when I'm incredibly drunk, which is when the magic happens between me and ISFP.
So the question is, Is it better for me to completely open up about who I am to an ISFP at first date? I never done it sober, but I would think it would scare them off since no one actually opens up at first few dates (maybe just me). Every type except ISFP, I can follow a routine and get them to like me without opening up. If there is a routine that an ISFP likes, would you guys care to tell me? If not, is taking off my mask and opening up my soft side the only way to get you guys to open up? Me opening up my soft side is equivalent to me kneeling to someone, and my conclusion was that you guys know that. 
If there is a right way to approach ISFP in general, let me know. One of my best friend is an ISFP, and tells me to be straight up and soft, but not really sure what that means and that's the only advice he'll ever give me."
2391,isfp,"As this specific ISFP girl: 
I don't like small talk. I'm not good at it and I'm pretty awkward. But if you can get me talking about something I'm interested in like my hobbies, I could go for a long time. Skip the small talk. Get to the real stuff and ask her questions about herself. It helps if you ask questions that cant be answered with just a yes or no. 
But just as a general human tip, it's typically best to be forward to the people you are interested in / friends with about who you are and what you want out of life. It helps relationships go a lot smoother, and you're probably likely to find someone similar to you a little easier. "
2392,isfp,"I read your reply, and I got alot out of it. Thank you. If you don't mind, could you answer this question as well?

Do you guys take your time when it comes to deciding when to start dating? Even though you have feelings(strong) for the person?
Do you like to tell the world that you are dating or do you like to keep it a secret between the two? I honestly think you guys want something in-between, am I correct on that?
"
2393,isfp,"Haha, the longest answer I have ever seen from an ISFP. Wish you guys were this talkative in real life. So overall, I just have to be patient and let things come naturally. You probably met alot of ENTJs in real life, we look like ISFJ on the surface. Thanks for the pointers."
2394,isfp,"Again, it really is up to the individual. But, for me


It depends on the person for me. I have started dating someone 2 weeks after we started hanging out, but then again I've also waited for quite a while. 


I don't really tell the world, but it's not like I keep it hidden. I'll put it on facebook and tell my friends. Theres not a lot of reasons I would keep a relationship secret. 

"
2395,isfp,"She likes me too but at the same time she's being really cold to me. She doesn't ask about me unless I start the conversation, I'm mostly the one talking all the time (I'm a INTP) and I am confused if she actually like me or just feeling some short term feelings? She said she had feelings for me a year ago but I was entering and leaving her life as I please and that made her felt guarded but I didn't know she liked me because she mostly flirted but never expressed her feelings to me. Until a few days ago I started talking to her and trying to get closer to her when she told me. 
I feel I'm the one being so incredibly clingy because I really want to talk to people I like for hours but I feel like I'm a liability to her and am pestering her nonstop for her attention. The lack of emotions, and she doesn't even like to share the emotions or admit stuff. But I want her to express that she wants me but I feel like I'm a afterthought.
Any advice? Anyone? Thanks in advance."
2396,isfp,"Link her this post, and let her know you made it. If a girl linked me this I would think it was cute as fuck. Not sure if she will, but if she is anything like me then that could be a good icebreaker.
Edit: Hell I would even delete this comment that way it looked like your idea."
2397,isfp,"It may seem like she's being cold and doesn't want to talk, but ISFP's just like listening and observing conversations quietly. Being an ISFP, my friends always think I'm disinterested because I don't speak up in conversations as much, but i just enjoy observing them.
Edit: Also, I can't stand it when people tell me I'm too cold and distant. It's just how I and most ISFP's come across, and I hate being told I should change."
2398,isfp,"You said there's a lack of emotion, I just wanted to make sure you know, ISFP's are extremely emotional. But since we have a ""cold"" exterior, we often find it difficult or don't want to express them, unless through our art.
Another thought, since we like to feel free and don't like other people restricting or controlling us, we can sometimes have commitment issues. I know commitment can make me feel colostrophic and trapped."
2399,isfp,"I did talk to her about all this, but it seems like she just doesn't like to share her feelings. I spent almost 2 hours trying to figure this out yet I'm still confused.
She's extremely cold sometimes and I am really affected by it.
She said she's afraid to hurt me and want to take it slow.
But I have no idea what to do. I'm at a complete loss.
I thought I could start my listing down all my flaws and whatever as a start, then I tried to make initiative but she's never as eager as me to respond or anything.
I feel like I'm the only one caring in this thing, she says she had feelings for me but I'm not sure if it's still present or it's just reminisce. 
I'm fucking confused. I really am.
I don't know who to go to. I only have one close friend who can't know about this because I feel it ain't right telling what's up between me and her to someone else when things ain't clear and I could misinterept it but yet I try to ask her questions so I can know what to try to do.
I'm looking at this logically, but the facts there's so much unknown info makes this incredibly hard for me. I wanna talk to her again about this but that close to 2 hours session already made her feel burdened and I don't want her to feel like I am trying to stress her out or rush this. I want to talk to somebody but I don't know who. So I hope someone here can help.
Edit: Oh shit, I accidentally typed too much."
2400,isfp,"The commitment thing I understand. I told her it's okay if she decides she doesn't like me. Just let me know and she told me she is going to cry (Something she never do; something that's god damn rare). 
‚Äã
But this was all over text. I know ISFP can be extremely emotional, but sometimes I just feel it's lack of interest more than just a cold exterior. I don't feel her caring. I crave it and I don't know if it's healthy, but I love to feel like I'm wanted and appreciated. The same way I make her feel. But it feels like I'm doing a lot more than her. I know I might sound like I'm doing a trade, but I am thinking about this logically I guess. If you can, can you offer me some tips on how to cope or deal with this?"
2401,isfp,"Unfortunately. I don't have any answers on what to do. If you really like her a lot, and you think she likes you. Then just give her some time/space man. Once again, if she is anything like me. She doesn't like the idea of long term commitment. Just keep showing her you care, and she might come around eventually.
Most importantly though. Just be real. Be yourself."
2402,isfp,"She told you she wants to take it slow because she sees that you are being clingy af and doesn't know how to gently put you down. 
And she's probably scared that you will react agressively because it's obvious you cannot handle emotions. Even more reason not to tell you anything. 
What you need to do is forget about this shit and distract yourself with something else. Girls generally HATE clingyness. As a matter of fact, most people do. I hate you right now just reading your post. (JK).
On a serious note, you need to cool off and give her space. "
2403,isfp,"Here are my thoughts, On the fact that you crave her to be caring. Here is an interesting theory I heard and somewhat observed in myself. I do not know if you ever heard about Carl Jung's theory on anima and animus. The animus is a females inner masculine side and the anima is males inner feminine side. Humans often project their anima/animus on the opposite sex as something they idealize and might look for in a partner. The problem though is this a idealized idea projected onto someone it's hard for anyone to live up to it. It is also important to recognize this projection as to not mess up your relationships.  Well moving on with my point supposedly our anima/animus is linked to our inferior function. In the case of an INTP that is Fe. So you might tend to like chicks that display High Fe qualities at times. Depending if believe the 4 sides of the mind theory to be true or not. INTP would have ESFJ subconscious that they aspire to be come like. That ESFJ subconscious is their inner feminine side. Ok well assuming everything I just wrote is correct, than it is safe to assume she has a personality type that she aspires to.  Her animus is connected with her Te function, the personality type she aspires to be is an ENTJ. If you emulate an ENTJ, which as an INTP shouldn't be hard since it's your shadow personality, you can be the very thing she aspires to be and thus make yourself more desirable to her. To be specific her inferior function is Te, so she often worries about what other people think of her, social status, and how effective is in accomplishing what she wants to do. If you can help her feel fulfilled in her inferior function she will start to see you as an asset she cannot be without. Target the inferior function, but in a positive way that's best way to win someone over in my opinion. So if I had to put it bluntly here are some things you can do. Increase your social status and get others to speak highly of you, than make it obvious that those people will think highly of her just for being with you. Also talk about you goals with her and then bring them into fruition in front of her she will admire you for that. If you can help bring her goals too fruition it's a plus. Let her know you think highly of her and show that you got other people to think highly of her. You could do this by showing her art to several people and showing how everybody loved it and now thinks highly of her. Also don't focus on trying to attend to her feelings as much feeding her your positive thoughts about her. The reason is your Fe is low and truth be told you might think you're good at using but you are probably terrible at it. If you make her Te satisfied her Fi will feel good about herself and you. Oh also be decisive. I have sister with Te inferior can never make a decision, but loves turning to other people to make them for her. The same might apply to your love interest.  
‚Äã
P.S targeting peoples inferior is a great way to make them love or hate you do with that knowledge as you please. Good luck"
2404,isfp,"I told her basically everything I know about myself and behavioural habits so she can watch out for my bads (e.g, unconsciously gulit tripping)
I didn't want her to enter what might be a toxic relationship without knowing. But I try hard to improve upon my faults and make myself better. Some times though, I just get distracted from it and start to do other things.
But when I remember, I try to learn from my mistakes and stop what I believe are bad habits."
2405,isfp,I think I've read that ISFPs are some of the hardest to get to know. At least it's true for me. Even if I like someone it takes forever until I can even begin to start opening up about my feelings. Calm down a bit and be patient. She probably wouldn't hang out with you if she did not like you.
2406,isfp,"But I don't get the point of this thread actually. If you expect her to tell you that she likes you, even if that's the case, there's high chances that you'll get disappointed. If you like her and want to go further with ther, why don't you just date her someday ? I mean maybe you already did but you didn't answer me :v "
2407,isfp,I was severely underweight in high school due to an eating disorder and had to leave halfway through freshman year to receive treatment. when I got back I heard that apparently I used hard drugs and had to leave for rehab. I didn't talk to anyone in high school so nobody really heard the truth from me.
2408,isfp,"Yes! I wouldn‚Äôt say I was profusely bullied through school, but I do remember a girl named Roxy walking up to me in the hall, getting in my face, and asking why I gave people dirty looks. Did I ‚Äúthink I was better than other people or something?‚Äù The funny thing is, I thought she was really cool before that happened and she didn‚Äôt know that. After that, I did not feel the same way about her. I have very few memories of junior high, but this is one of them."
2409,isfp,"There is an ongoing debate in my head about Marilyn Manson's type. 
He seems to be an ISFP. But celebrity types and a lot of other people have him typed as an INFJ. 
I just see so much Fi in him. 
Also, not a lot of Ni. 
Anyone else have input on this?
If you think he is an INFJ I would appreciate input in why. 
:) thanks"
2410,isfp,"This is a bit hard to explain. But I think that he can come off as an Fi user because it looks like he is actively expressing himself. However, I think that it is less self-expression and more him trying to prove his opinions and viewpoints using his appearance and imagery. Whereas a typical ISFP would express themselves to state how they are feeling in the present without the need for others to conform to that state of being. If that makes any sense. "
2411,isfp,"Um, because he's a creepy weirdo who makes bad music and has this whole outcast, anti-establishment thing going on...?
ISFPs are sensitive. Peace, love, happiness.
I've never suspected Manson as being anything other than INxJ. "
2412,isfp,"That actually does. I appreciate that. 
I always has a thought in the back if my mind that he could have Fe because he says that he ""wants to make people think"" which is cool to me. 
So now that I have another opinion I really appreciate it. :)"
2413,isfp,"Met her through the ex of my friend, she invited her to us, A week after she added me on Facebook and after some talking one night she invited me to her birthday at some bar. Our fist kiss happened there and then that was it, it's been 5 months now.
Funny detail about the night, I greeted her and her friend, went to the bar to pick up drinks. Sat down a table and this is where I felt like we should probably discuss but after 20 minutes not one have said a word. It was near that moment where ours eyes met for a good minute and then we kissed. To this day I have no clue how I can attract women by saying 0 words."
2414,isfp,"Flirt with the person. That means eye contact, smiles, some physical contact. Try brushing your fingers against theirs, see how they respond. Touch them lightly on the arm. If they are into it it's pretty easy to tell I think."
2415,isfp,"as an infp iv noticed the function that realy gives me intuitive insights into people is my tertery si(introverted sensing)i can quickly notice when something is off with someone,but the framework that my si has build from them,slight behavour changes and ill start getting impressions of an off feeling........my question is how does your tertery ni work?,and how does your ni work when reading people?"
2416,isfp,"The way I observe people is mainly through their actions. Also I have hunches about people that mostly come from Ni. Don't exactly know how to explain it. My Ni gives me a rough-ish mental framework of how the person is like. For example if someone had said or done something that contradicts what they had earlier said or done I usually assume they are two faced. But I might still be curious why. My Ni mostly wants to gather as much information from the person as possible. I become a little obsessed with people I meet (not to the same extent as INxJs might, though), although I notice most people don't tend to be as ''obsessed'' or don't bother to dive deep. I am always open to new information. I usually pay attention to their interests, how they react to things, what their outlook on life is, etc. I try not to hold onto my ideas of people too much. I try not to make conclusions about people until I feel like I've gathered enough information. I try to remind myself of the possibility that they might secretly dislike me or they might betray me somewhere in the future (if I become friends with them), and just focus on how they are feeling in the moment. Therefore I tend to hold myself back a lot with new people. But when there's someone that I click with, or someone who just ''understands'' me, I tend to be a lot more open with them. 
When reading people, I focus a lot on their facial expressions and their mood. If they're in a bad mood, I usually tend to be more tentative and short with my speech to let them sort out their bad feelings. I might also link together ideas, or think about related things to what they are talking about in the background while I am talking with them. I don't let them see the process, as it's usually hard to define in the spot anyway. My answers might be short and not exactly descriptive of what's going on inside my mind as my communication style tends to be very in the moment. 
Hope this helped 
edit: Dunno about other ISFPs, but this is how I notice myself working most of the time."
2417,isfp,"Withdraws for months? Is that a thing ISFPs do (I genuinely don't know, I'm just bouncing around MBTI subs killing time)? That's sounding more like depression than anything type related. 
Might he be trying to end the relationship but isn't able to just come right out and say it's over? You deserve an explanation. I can see a bad week, but a bad couple months? Why not just ask if he's doing ok at this point? It seems like you've given him plenty of time."
2418,isfp,"I did like 30 tests and almost all told me INFP, plus 3 told me ISFP. People in Reddit typed me as ISFP, so now I'm curious about how did you figure out your type. They say that ISFPs are more physical than INFPs.
I perceive in me some things that aren't pretty physical:
‚Ä¢ I don't perceive details nor am I very observant.
‚Ä¢Almost every day I come up with new ideas for creating memes lol
‚Ä¢ I'm not good in any physical skill, I really suck at mechanics, drawing, etc. I even break things inadvertenly.
‚Äã
Can I be a weird ISFP with low Se?"
2419,isfp,"INFPs have polr Se, and ISFPs have polr Ne. Who bothers you more, ENFPs or ESFPs? One of these types is your ‚Äòsupervisor‚Äô type, whose dominant function is your ‚Äòkryptonite‚Äô. It could provide some clues as to your actual type."
2420,isfp,"I tested for years on free tests as INFP.
I just did a real mbti and result came back as ISFP! 
Almost right in the middle of S and N.
I always remind myself that it's a scale. We are capable and do function using different ways when we adapt to life"
2421,isfp,"I just  did the kisa.ca test - this bit might help  
ISFPs are less fantasy-oriented than INFPs. These types are often confused, however, INFPs lean strongly to daydreams, poetry, prose and more philosophical pursuits; ISFPs often live out 'id' experiences rather than writing or even talking about them."
2422,isfp,"wow thank you how knowledgeable.
‚Äã
I don't know a lot of EFPs, but I fell in love with an ENFP once. Also, a friend of her that was ESFP liked me. I loved the ENFP girl but she seemed to be resentful with all men and I never got her attention. Her ESFP friend and I were together for a while, although we ended up very badly because ESFP girl was very restless, not honest enough, and very changeable.
‚Äã
BUT, I think I'd love ENFP people and some male ESFP friends. ESFP girls seemed to be very hyperactive and fucked up."
2423,isfp,"There are some people who fall in love with their supervisor type, and it does seem to work out. I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is if you‚Äôre irritated by Ne or Se-doms in general (not the specific person). From your reply, it seems to be Se-doms. So I‚Äôll be leaning towards INFP."
2424,isfp,"I'm sorry i don't know. I love to create memes. but I feel physical and soul suffering when I can not think of new ideas. Also I should fucking finish at least one story but I'm too fucking lazy.
‚Äã
how about you? how did you realized that you're ISFP and not INFP?"
2425,isfp,"Eh.  It depends on how much validity you give socionics.  I (enfp) have never had issues with my so called supervisor type (intp) and have even had a very successful relationship with one.  In fact, i would say they are one of my favorite types."
2426,isfp,"Because of Se and Te. Inferior Te confirmed from where does my stress come (not being acknowledged and recognized for what I do). And I discovered that aux Se, as its name, it has helped me through my life. Living the moment makes me feel great, creating art makes my mind stop thinking and just feel. 
The Ni makes sense to me because it means I play with few ideas, focusing on them, meanwhile my Ne is practically absent. I love listening to my INFP friend because she jumps from idea to idea and it's really entertaining. I usually come back to the same topic and develop it."
2427,isfp,"No worries.  :) 
I went to a career counselor to explore the idea of other options for work. And I we did a Meyers briggs type indicator.   
I think you can pay to do the test yourself on their website. "
2428,isfp,"I was super shy. Had a few friends, no one really hated me. Seemed to get along with others who didn‚Äôt fit in maybe because they were a bit desperate for friends and I didn‚Äôt judge them for being different. I didn‚Äôt care for being one of the cool kids although I think I may of given off that vibe because I didn‚Äôt care about how I looked or behaved. I just dressed comfortably and hang around people who weren‚Äôt fake. I liked being around other people but never really said much unless I was with my best friends. I usually had maybe 1-3 of them. Never went to parties because I felt like they probably don‚Äôt want me because I‚Äôm boring. I was good at most of the hands on sort of stuff. Bad at English. Loved geography. I‚Äôm pretty good with spacial awareness and love the outdoors and nature. Pretty good at most sports but not great at any in particular. Usually did better in individual sports like running or swimming. I particularly liked cross country running and did pretty good with it. I never had the organisation to train for it but. I just liked being able to be competitive without talking myself up and no one seeing me as you normally are running through the bush. Plus it‚Äôs outside in untouched scrub which is where I love to be. Almost never did homework, did assignments on the due date but still got good marks. Tried a few extra curricular things, usually sports or music but never really stuck with any of them. Otherwise I pretty much just kept under the radar, not getting in trouble and not over achieving."
2429,isfp,"My school was small, and so most of the kids were in the same classes as me from 9th to 12th grade. First 2 years of school I was quiet and then I started to know more people and get more comfortable, and then i became a goofy kid who wouldn‚Äôt shut up during class but i think that‚Äôs what made school so much fun for me"
2430,isfp,"I‚Äôd throw hot chip oil at Ramsey.
I cannot stand how serious he takes his profession. For the past year I‚Äôve been doing an catering course in college (Joining an art course next year due to a weird issue I couldn‚Äôt join last year) and he makes me hate it with a passion when I see him on TV.
He‚Äôs also pretty creepy.
You should pay more attention to what he does.


Apparently he would actually hit his ‚Äúpenis‚Äù of Gino D‚Äôacampo‚Äôs head to wake him up when they were on some sort of trip.


He also acted extremely creepy towards Sof√≠a Vergara when he was on a talk show with her.


3.He hired someone to take pictures of his father in law through his bedroom window.
Etc. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt there has been worst things he‚Äôs committed but that‚Äôs some of the things I know about.
I ain‚Äôt a good person myself but I‚Äôd repeatedly stab Gordon Ramsey without second thought if he dared to even increase his voice volume to me...."
2431,isfp,"I recently took the test the second time, with the same result, so I checked out this sub. I know it's slow, but I was wondering if a lot of you have this same feeling, where it feels like it would be most fulfilling to go out and meet all sorts of people but you can't because you're too introverted. Because I'm slowly coming to the realization that the emptiness of my life would be filled to some extent if I could muster up the bravery to be more social. I guess in a way this is in the definition of isfp but I'm not sure you feel that way haha. And if you have any advice on getting out of your social comfort zone I'd be glad to hear it."
2432,isfp,"Totally relatable. Best way to become more social (or so I'm told) is practice. Throw yourself into social situations and don't try too hard to talk all the time. It's natural for us to prefer listening, so just give your viewpoint when you're comfortable and don't be afraid of silence. It's underrated how comforting it is just to have someone present and willing to listen.
As you get to know people better, you'll find yourself more comfortable sharing your ideas with them over time."
2433,isfp,"I dont think i've ever seen a more relatable post on this sub. There are times when i cant talk, but really want to socialize with people, and when i try to talk to someone, i can't find anything to talk about. "
2434,isfp,"I'm late but if you're going to use a label use it to your benefit and not to your detriment. You sound shy and self doubting. Literally fake it til you make it. I know this kinda goes against our Fi and can come across as cringey if it's taken overboard, but start small like standing up straight, making eye contact with people and smiling. You'll notice people reciprocating these small gestures and it'll fuel actual confidence and good feelings. It's also helpful to actually take an interest in other people and learn about them. Everyone's a little narcissistic and if you demonstrate and interest in others it catalyzes some actual quality friendships. Lastly...you're right about mustering up the bravery to be more vulnerable. Let yourself open up, make mistakes, be disliked by some, and liked by others. Reddit is a good platform to do some preliminary tests. Have discussions with people, expose yourself to the full gamut of reactions and see how you yourself react. It's kinda like exposure therapy in a sense because that initial fear of the feeling of fear and sadness itself needs to be overcome :) "
2435,isfp,Yes. I felt the same way until I found my current gf. She definitely helps take the edge off things (she's a INFP). Also working retail opened me up a lot too. I'm still very reserved and positively sceptical towards people I don't know well and strangers. 
2436,isfp,"I feel the same and its the reason that made chatting online so appealing. With voice chat so prominent I can easily talk to all kinds of people and if I dont like them I can just leave without having to feel guilty about ditching. Also gives you a lot of room to practice your social skill, the worse you can do is to say something dumb and since no one even know who you are anyways you can just pretend it never happened and do better next time. 
I was in a bit of a hole a few years back where for two years I would barely get out of my room and the only people I would talk to were cashiers. I began stuttering due to my lack of practice and finally realize I should probably find some people I can talk to from time to time."
2437,isfp,"This. 
Eventually also you as ISFPs will find somebody who you will be comfortable enough to talk to for hours straight and feel listened to. I mean: they will want to know your opinions and ask you for them and if you're comfy you can't stop talking at times and that's the moment you know this person is a good friend/partner. 
But to find these people you just gotta be active and yall actually have an easy time doing so afaik (since you are do-ers). "
2438,isfp,"Do you think a wolf can be happy on his own?
Historically even if you were a hunter or scout or smth: after months of absence you came back to your community because in the end you are a part of it.
This would be my guess."
2439,isfp,"As I've been reading up on ISFP, I've noticed that a common problem is academics. I've never really been great with school and Now that I'm in college (Music Education/ Junior), I notice it more. For those of you who have had this problem and overcome it, what are some tips you could give? "
2440,isfp,"I used to purposefully rebel against school, but my mother put the fear of god into me about my grades in high school. It worked well; I was a straight A student (although I refused to take certain hard classes like calculus and took a bunch of electives instead). Now that I've been away from her for a few years and I'm in grad school, I'm starting to fall back into my natural ISFP ways. This means major procrastination, blowing off the assignments that I think are stupid, trying to get by with extra credit after the fact, and generally being pissed off at having to jump through all of the hoops in higher education. 
So unless you can simulate an overly-controlling parent...I don't really know that I have a way to overcome it except to keep your motivation going. You've made it to junior year when many ISFPs don't even go to college, so you're almost there! It helps if the major you chose is worthwhile to you. I'm in music myself, and I know music ed at my undergrad was difficult even for my friends with more ambitious personalities. 
And remember that your type is just your preference. It's not a limit. You can do anything you want to do with enough willpower and discipline. "
2441,isfp,"I've always enjoyed hands on work experience and making money more than school. Currently taking a year off from school and have been working construction for roughly seven months now, and I LOVE IT. The thing I always hated about school was studying my ass off for classes and either barely passing the test or failing the test, especially in math.. This always happened in math class. My advice would be to just crack down and study A LOT. As ISFPs, we tend to learn better in hands-on environments and worse in memorizing material for theoretical or math classes. However, even though we're not as LIKELY to be good at school, anyone can do it, you just have to conjure up the motivation to study your ass off for your classes, and the hardest part.. telling your homies you can't chill tonight, you gotta study. That was the hardest thing for me to do. But yeah.. study a lot, don't slack off. You can do it, I BELIEVE IN YOU, pjsans!"
2442,isfp,"This. Great advice for all types and any problems they experience. The MBTI wasn't created to say ""This is what you can do, and this is what you can't do."" It's to help people understand themselves and each other."
2443,isfp,"I was hitting random on reddit (dangerous, I know) at work, and came across another personality subreddit. I thought to myself, hey let's see what I am I haven't taken that test since high school psychology... The answer fit me so well. I knew I was kind of different from a lot of the friends I had (which I made through my husband). But there's more like me! I'm just excited, that's all. :)"
2444,isfp,"Hey Guys, I am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project.
I just finished the ISFP video and thought I'd let you know :)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjYSYxcQkoo&list=PLNEe4b41ZB2ZY1WwQahLvwH4iq_YEN_x7&index=14
I really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think!
Enjoy! :)"
2445,isfp,"wtf? this is ISFP not ISTJ.
Also I don't relate to any of the weaknesses you mentioned, I don't think this video is super accurate
2 of my favorite hobbies you mentioned though (the arts and skiing)"
2446,isfp,"What have been the biggest issues/problems YOU have had in your past (or present) relationships?
For example:
When I get really negatively emotional (sad or mad) about something it‚Äôs as if there is a block between my brain and my mouth and I feel like a physically can‚Äôt express myself if words. I have to be alone, calm down, and then come back to talk.
With friendships, I feel like I cant keep them. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I try hard to be up and happy and let my ‚Äúfun outgoing‚Äù side show and then I burn out, or what but I feel like I‚Äôve never met a single person other than my husband that I can truly be myself around - both my fun/goofy/light as well as my introspective/deep-thinking/more serious side."
2447,isfp,"Gosh, I relate to this post 100%.
Are you me? üòÇ because i am also married and i feel the exact same way.
I feel like i am incapable of making long lasting friendships :/
But my husband has made me realize that i am quite an impatient person. Meaning that i want deep friendship right away. But forming close relationships takes time.
But my dilemma is that, i dont want to extend my energy and heart into making a friendship to someone if it doesnt work out."
2448,isfp,"Relationships: Irrational, emotional, impatient. Working on them all. 
Friendships: I feel similar. The outgoing side is so draining, I LOVE being in close friendship with people where even silence is companionable. I do have a small circle at the moment though and meeting people has been so so tough in my new city so I need to get over that! "
2449,isfp,"Not making myself available and fluctuating interest.  I can be very into a person for days, weeks, or an extended period of time, and then totally lose track of them.  On the romantic side, I can be pretty guarded and anxious when I first get to know a girl.  Gotten a lot better with maturity thankfully!"
2450,isfp,"Yeah a recent development in my romantic relationship is in quite a number of situations I just stop talking... if he asks me questions I will happily ""tap once for yes, or two for no"". Its usually about something I don't want to talk about, or don't want to say because I don't want to upset him or make the situation worse. "
2451,isfp,Yes!! That‚Äôs exactly me. I also moves a lot as a child so every time I made a close friend we moved and I think that has something to do with it? But yes! Friendships take energy and if they don‚Äôt work out it‚Äôs just hurtful and exhausting
2452,isfp,"Never bothered to classify a peer as a ""friend"" so i had really, 1 best friend and most of the people in my classes were ""welcome acquaintances."" Had one relationship in the first year that I ended because I wanted to focus on school and myself (pretty selfish I know, I'm better now). 
And I never felt the need to ""fit in"" to the system. I wanted to be me because for some reason I liked myself at 14 years old. Peers chose to like me or dislike me because of it. By the time I graduated most of my school knew who I was and I knew most of them. In the end, I had a pretty good experience in high school, even if I'm in the minority because of it."
2453,isfp,"Personally for me, I only keep tight friend circles, good relationships with my teachers and classmates mostly, and I've attempted to start an intimate relationship with someone who didn't feel the same. A lot of the time I also feel like an outcast since I socialize a lot less than most of the other people do. "
2454,isfp,"I carved out my own little social niche - a group of 6-8 friends or so, and more than a handful of amicable acquaintances. 
I came close to intimate/romantic relationships a few times from junior to senior years, but I was just too shy to take it any further. I wasn‚Äôt emotionally ready, and it didn‚Äôt help that the guys I knew had pretty overbearing personalities.
I felt different, like I didn‚Äôt fit in with any particular group. In contrast, I presented and conducted myself in a chameleon-like way. I kept up with the latest trends, said things I thought would be acceptable to everyone else, was careful not to offend anyone. Tried to remain on good terms with everyone. My personality sort of lived through other people, and I frequently got lost in the mix."
2455,isfp,"I was one the football team and the Golf Team and both teams won states while I was on it, so no one hated me but no one really loved me either. 
It was one of those things where they try to talk to me and I talk back but not interesting enough for people to care nor be offended so people liked me and all the ""cool kids"" knew me but I wasn't exactly popular as I didn't hangout with them. 
I tended to hangout with the lower tier cool kids that were super smart and social and a year ahead of me. I didn't realize all my friends were older than me until I was a senior and had no good friends in school. 
Its actually interesting to look back at my high school life being 8 years out. If you ask my brother and sister in law they would say I was popular though. "
2456,isfp,It would take a lot for me to comfortably say someone was a friend. At the end of it all I only had three true and strong friends that stayed together and to me the rest of my group were in varying levels of the periphery. I am definitely a quality over quantity person. I tried the other way around and it was no where near fullfilling enough for me. I was pretty much what you would describe as blending into the lockers. I didn't mind though I was living in my happy life and that was that 
2457,isfp,"I had (still have) quite a lot of friends (around 6). Didn't (and still don't) really see them much outside of school, though. We still keep contact through WhatsApp and see each other every now and then, but overall it's fine I guess."
2458,isfp,"What are friends? (somewhat sarcastic)
I had a handful of friends, none of which I was really close with, except for one of them, whom I ended up dating for just over half a year. Since high school my social life has done all but improve. I've met maybe 2 people in college, neither of which I talk to outside of class."
2459,isfp,"I was lucky enough to go to a school system where marching band was a cool thing to be in. So I had a family of 140 people through high school, and as with family, you don't always like them, but you can trust them to be there for you. I had lots of close acquaintances, and several really good friendships that have continued after graduation. (Mellophone FTW)"
2460,isfp,"I'm in high school currently (freshman so kinda young) and I have a smallish- medium circle of friends, ALOT of acquaintances which with a decent amount I will have a small conversation with every single once in a while, I haven't been in a relationship for awhile, though I do has a girl that likes be cuz I use to talk to her back n 6th grade and she left for a couple years and now shes back and recognizes me, and I like her back to cuz she's pretty, but in really shitty at showing it since I don't talk to her currently and she eyes me n the hall every day but I act like she doesn't exist, so if she stops liking me, I don't blame her. Overall, I REALLY enjoy the freedom I have in high school, I've noticed it alot in my work, but I really just prefer to have a teacher tell me exactly what to do. So if that answers your question, then COOL."
2461,isfp,"I had formed a pretty solid group of friends in middle school(about 10 or so people) with pretty diverse personality types, which actually worked out really well. Most of us stayed friends through high school with some people entering or leaving the group, but there was a good handful of us that stayed together through high school. I graduated 2 years ago and since then we've all had our own separate lives with work/college and whatnot, and there's only 4-5 of them that I still consider close friends. The kind of friends that you can go a while without talking but can seamlessly catch back up once you talk again. 
Outside of that, I really didn't make any new friends past sophomore year. I was too shy to talk to people in my classes. I kept my head down while walking in the halls and overall felt pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people. My senior year was especially rough because I didn't have a single class or the same lunch period with any of my friends. I would often just go and sit in my car or outside somewhere during lunch. I did end up becoming casual friends with one girl who shared the same lunch period with me, but even then I would sometimes avoid meeting her at lunch to spare myself forced small talk. My social anxiety made me feel that she would sit with me only because she felt bad that I would otherwise be alone, and I preferred spending lunch alone to feeling like that. In hindsight I do think she genuinely enjoyed my company, but I digress. 
The final factor that affected my social life was the guy(INTJ) I was dating through my junior and senior years. He was in college and quite a few years older than me. The gist of that situation being that he vied for my full attention and caused me to drift away from my close circle of friends. I deeply regret that whole relationship for a number of reasons, but relevant to this post, he absolutely stunted my social life in high school. 
Overall 0/10 would not relive high school. "
2462,isfp,"I'm a much different person now but in high school, I had a small group of 6-7 friends. I didn't see them much other than outside of school or after school Fridays. The odd Saturday if they wanted to see a movie, or something. Tried pursuing 2 different girls but no luck. 
Assuming you mean popularity wise, I wasn't an outcast but I wasn't the cool kid either. Got invited out to events; was friends with 2 of the ""it"" girls. I was pretty quiet, and reserved unless I was with those closer friends though. Was somewhat friends with the cool kids, where I got invited to their parties but never went because they weren't my close friends."
2463,isfp,"Nope. I focused my energy on things that I enjoyed doing and learning about. I was super into music and spent most of my time practicing, or taking lessons from my director. I spent most of my lunch periods playing duets/trios with other musical friends so I wasn't at all focused on how others perceived me because I was loving life. 
Also I mistyped as isfp, I'm istp per my new flair. Thought being a thinker meant I was incapable of empathy lmao. "
2464,isfp,"Estp here. My brother in law is istp. We get along surprisingly well. I think his strongest trait that gets me every time is his ability to subtly point out the irony in every situation. 
He‚Äôs a type 5 (on the enneagram) though, acts like everyone is a greedy bastards but I think it‚Äôs all in his own head. "
2465,isfp,"I'm istp in terms of preference for cognitive functions but not at all in terms of the stereotype. Part of the reason I thought I was isfp. I can't fix a car, nor am I interested in learning how. Also type 5 but I find that most people into enneagram are either depressed or mentally unhealthy in some way so I try and steer clear of it.
I tend to get along with estps too my little brother is one. They make it easy to let loose as long as their not a jerk. You seem aight though."
2466,isfp,"It‚Äôs kind of a hard question to answer. Assuming you‚Äôre asking because you‚Äôre questioning your type, I‚Äôd say the best thing you can do is just research cognitive functions and whatever as much as possible and see. Personally, I just knew when I researched it. But there are a few things that might help you. 
Fi is our dominant function. It allows us to deal with most things based on how we feel about them personally. We‚Äôre very in tune with our feelings; and use this to make a lot of decisions or thoughts. It also gives us a very individual sense. We know what we like, and we show this with pride. Do you say ‚ÄúI think that..‚Äù or ‚ÄúI feel like..‚Äù ? That might be a little indicator.
Then, we have Se. Se gives us a very in tune appreciation for the world in a very sense based way. Particularly aesthetically. Do you live in the present moment, taking everything in? Do you have a great appreciation for art forms, even creating art yourself? If so, this probably applies to you. 
Apart from functions, we can focus on stereotypes and/or what we might be like. Now, personally, I love helping people. We‚Äôre some great therapists and can really help people in need mentally - and I get great joy in doing so. But we‚Äôre also very quiet people. We‚Äôll be the ones sitting back, taking everything in. Not adding anything unless we think it‚Äôs necessary. We also value our freedom above pretty much else. We can‚Äôt be forced into something, and we probably won‚Äôt do anything we don‚Äôt want to - not unless we have too. 
Anyway - I‚Äôm not sure how accurate any of that was. It was also quite a surface based thing. Perhaps if you mention what types you‚Äôre stuck between it would be easier to decipher. Hope I helped in some way."
2467,isfp,"Very, very similar I think. I know many people who are unsure which they are. Even I have questions sometimes.
It‚Äôs difficult to say the similarities, but both types lead with dominant introverted feeling. I think also many people just confuse themselves on stereotypes. Based off cognitive functions - it can be fairly simple to tell the differences. But often people just feel like a mix of the two. I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm not really the best person to ask. But yes, they are very similar types."
2468,isfp,The ‚ÄòA‚Äôand ‚ÄòT‚Äô seem to correlate with neuroticism in the ‚ÄòBig 5‚Äô personality test. I personally think it‚Äôs an indicator of how healthy someone is. My psychologist seems to think that neuroticism correlates with being a HSP (highly sensitive person).
2469,isfp,"I can give hugs and kisses when i meet someone, but it's just routinary, i do it because it is what you do when you meet with relatives or friends. If i have to show affection, like real, it is very hard to say ""i love you"", no matter it is my mom, best friend or partner, i have no idea why, but for me it's so hard to say 3 words."
2470,isfp,"I am definitely not a verbal person in this area, unless it's after a long night and I'm a little bit drunk. I just started seeing a guy and realised that I like to buy really inexpensive, meaningful, playful gifts. For example, while getting groceries, he asked me to get him a single apple. I asked what type and he said 'surprise me', so I bought him 5 different apples - partly because i found it funny and mainly because it was too much pressure to choose "
2471,isfp,"I do thoughtful little things for them to make their lives easier. I rarely explicitly state that I appreciate them and if I do it comes out a little unnaturally. If that person is affectionate with me I am really affectionate back to show appreciation, but if not I just do little nice random things for them. "
2472,isfp,"I usually tease them jokingly, and sometimes get carried away with it. You‚Äôll also know how much I love and appreciate you, if I‚Äôm willing to talk to you more than most people, and stay close to you through thick and thin. Also, I‚Äôll try to go out of my way to compromise, help out, and make you feel at ease, if I genuinely care about you when you ask for help, and sometimes even do nice things for you without anything to gain from you at all because I genuinely care about you. "
2473,isfp,"Hmm... I say it in a very straightforward manner. Like, if I wanted to show my appreciation for someone I block all of the hesitance away and let my thoughts speak. Straightforward meaning no segues. I rarely do it anyway and there are only a number of people I hold on a high regard so fuck it right? I would go out of my way to help them too, and offer support when needed."
2474,isfp,"I did not read it, but i am familiar with the concept : )
I was wondering if isfps have a preferred language among the 5, but preferred to ask differently. Im impressed by the fact that my purpose was discovered so easily :))) "
2475,isfp,"There has been some research done as far as this. Not official in any means, but someone did a survey amongst relatives and coworkers and found some correlation for some personality types, but none for others. I think isfp was pretty sporadic across the board."
2476,isfp,"I used to hate sleeping. I've learned to accept it as my condition gets severely worse if I go too long without sleep. I've done about 10 days without sleep before, although that could be wrong as you lose track of time after about 5 days."
2477,isfp,"Is there anything better than sex?
Yes. Eight uninterrupted hours of sleep. I don't know many things that feel better than not being tired all damn day. Sex feels really good during. Eight hours of sleep feels great for like 16 hours."

2479,isfp,i actually have quite a few infp friends and i form really good relationships with them so i'm guessing our personalities are just compatible somehow ü§î but no really i've been wondering the same thing since i get along with them so well
2480,isfp,"http://www.typeinmind.com/fise/
http://www.typeinmind.com/fine/
Fi mega dom combo.
If you look at the functions it makes tons of sense. Both with each other trying to get stuff done (aux Se, helps 3rd Si) and figure stuff out (and aux Ne, helps 3rd Ni).
Also, both bad at Te. ;D"
2481,isfp,"Yep, I'm an ISFP and one of my closest friends is an INFP. She's actually the one who told me about the 16 personality types and convinced me to take the test. My younger sister is also an INFP.  I feel the most comfortable with them because its always a judgement free zone~ "
2482,isfp,"I have been changing best friends in the past few years and hadn't been successful, mainly because I don't talk much and these friends dreaded silence. it didn't feel comfy so these friendships didn't last long.
So now my best friend is an infp and we get along quite well. We don't talk much and we stay together to do our own things separately. it is comfortable and I like it :) . There is one time we went out tgt with my other friend and she complained about how quiet we are lol."
2483,isfp,"Hi ISFPs!
I have problem with my productivity. I recently quit my job, to start my own business. I quit it on December. It means that since January 1 I am unemployed. I didn't start process of creating business because I thought that I will create product first, then handle formalities. The problem is I can't make myself do it. Every day I watch a lot of tv shows and movies. I first two weeks of January it felt good, because I was so overworked in last year or more in witch I had only few days off. But recently my internal compass is telling me that I should start doing something. But I'm still looking for distractions and not doing actual stuff. Recently I feel like I lie to myself.
How do You manage Your productivity? How to escape trap I have put myself into?"
2484,isfp,"Seems to be a common problem for ISFP. So many times I've had my big plan of all the cool things I would do using my skills, but in the moment I'm always just sleepy and unmotivated. In school I frequently turned in essays overdue and incomplete. 
I need an employer to keep me accountable, that might be the route for you too. Or at least build your business in spare time before making it your full time gig."
2485,isfp,"Hi
I have a similar problem since I was a teen. But slowly it makes me sick because I can't manage to do anything for a longer period. I always get distracted by anything that entertains me.
But slowly it starts change. Because I know I always try to lie to myself e.g. that I'll just watch this one episode and end up watching three I wrote my daily goals on a piece of paper in table form.
And at the end of everyday I make a cross for every goal I didn't manage to finish and a checkmark for every goal I successfully finished. This process makes me always aware when and where I failed and I feel bad about it and have more motivation to change that.
To clarify your goal seems important to me and when you realize that you feel like you are wasting your time do something about that in that moment.
(Too many ""you""s in that sentence ^^)
At least I try to do so for myself and I have to say its getting better :)"
2486,isfp,"Yeah, I noticed that most productive I was in toxic environment from co-workers and on small pay, that I barely could afford anything. I was motivated to work on so many levels. The more I got experience, and the ""better"" work environment I got, the worse my performance was.
I always dreamed about self employment, but I had no energy to pursuit it after hours of work, I felt so tired. I saved up, quit my job and I have a lot of time now, but still can't fight for my self employment to be my saviour."
2487,isfp,"You wrote this post so I assume you already feel guilty that you don't do anything. This piece of paper should just remind you that you do.
Another similar method would be that whatever it is you want to do write it down and pin it somewhere where you will see it several times a day. I guess this could be more effective because at least for me it is that I tend to forget what I wanted to do this day because my mind gets distracted easily.
In the end you have to know why you want to do what you aim for and be consequent although it's the hardest part.
Everytime you notice you lie to youself try to analyze why you did this and how to prevent that. It will make you more aware when you are about to do it again.
I know it is unbelievably hard to motivate oneself and  I still struggle with this. But I realised that my biggest mistake was not to work on this issue.
If you consistently try to work on it you will find your own way to overcome it :)"
2488,isfp,"That sounds veery familiar :/
I don't really know how to train oneself to be consequent. The best way that worked for me was to clearly imagine and write down what would be if I would reach my goals. What would be the outcome when I successfully pursue them. I also wrote down the worst possible outcome if I would all my bad habits take the lead in my life and how it would affect me and my life.
That process gave me a clear image of what I desire and what I totally want to avoid and gave me a huge boost to my motivation to change something. I believe that it is really important to make clear what you want reach and where you aim at. That helped me a lot to prevent postponing things. Whenever I'm about to postpone things I think about why am I doing this and get the motivation to not let my bad habits dominate me.
A person that inspired me to do these things was Jordan Peterson.
I can recommend him because he speaks clearly and gives me a certain kind of motivation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU
This is a part of a lesson from him that could suit to your case."
2489,isfp,"I am also no native speaker. But I can understand that. I have some friends who hate to listen to him too ^^. It is a part of a lesson and so the context is missing a little bit. I guess it is better to watch a whole video so you can get his whole image but if you don't like him there is no need to.
But I would really recommend you to write down these things I wrote you. Today I noticed again how disgusted I am of my pictue of my worst future and how energy I get to avoid this future.
Another thing I noticed is that I am way more productive if I don't have to work alone. Because I feel more responsible to make that project a success and I don't want the other person to be disappointed so that may also work.
I hope you will find a way :)"
2490,isfp,"all of my favorite subs are banned;(
/r/frugalmalefashion is ok. I check r/wwiipics and r/battlecars sometimes, otherwise I'm getting pretty tired of this site- too much censorship and seems like there's no room to have different thoughts than whatever's popular. though that's the same on other sites like voat, just that the popular opinion is different and there's less censorship
lately have been looking at r/mbti and some of the other type subs like r/infp and r/istp, kind of fun to look at these places ~~and feel better about myself~~ and see our similarities and differences"
2491,isfp,"I did the personality test on that 16personalities website (since it appeared the most attractive/professional) and tested as ISFP(-T) 4 separate times over the course of a week. I'm new at this but I decided to reach out to the inter-webs since I haven't tried this method yet, here goes nothing.
I've been in a little bit of a (well kinda big) rut recently since entering the university system last year, I still have no idea what I want to do although I definitely know what I don't or wouldn't like to do in the future (e.g. definitely not mechanical engineering or the sciences). I used to be interested in film (fueled by my enjoyment from making YouTube videos for fun) but that kind of died off, just like my interest for business studies/commerce. I've been attempting programming during my time in university, but recently that has been dwindling too. It's not like I am failing horribly at those subjects, in fact i'd say i'm doing decently; it's just that I find it really hard to justify doing something if I don't enjoy it (for an extended period of time). I started to notice and acknowledge that my work ethic revolves around random bursts of high energy and motivation whenever I find something I am genuinely interested in whether it be a subject, a hobby or even something as minuscule as shooting a basketball, I would literally dedicate my entire life towards that activity and become the most efficient and hard-working person that I personally know of. But as a result, if nothing ignites me or interests me in the first place, I procrastinate (a lot), lose motivation and as of recently, start questioning whether I made the right choice in choosing media as my major. I am jealous that many of my friends found their place at their unis and seem to be excelling in their fields and healthily developing as an individual, finding internships and what-not, getting fit and healthy, making money etc. And here I am again, wondering what went so wrong.
Why can't I handle stress and/or bite the bullet like my friends? Why do I mentally and physically crumble under (the smallest amounts of) stress? Why do I procrastinate so much even though I know that I can physically do a certain task?  Why am I always unsatisfied and anxious? Those are probably some of the questions I google every night before I worry myself to sleep (am I even an ISFP?). It's just so depressing thinking about this stuff but I feel if I were to suppress these feelings, they would probably creep up on me in the future. I tried sharing with friends and family, but they don't seem to fully understand (comprehend), maybe because I am bad at explaining what's going on inside my head, or they're not taking me seriously. Every time I try to explain the struggle i'm going through (especially to elders) I get the ""you're not in the workforce yet, so just get good grades"" talk. I understand that they might have gone through the college experience and found some secure 9-5 job that pays good money, but that doesn't mean I should subject myself to that same path (of torture) doing something I have no interest in, come out working some random job which I will hate for the next 20 years only to say ""I hate myself"". 
Speaking of hate, I sometimes hate how emotionally sensitive/weak I am. Maybe I can attribute that to my weak strength (relative to the world) so I can't exactly put up a fight, nor do I want to since I know I'll lose. Or my mental capabilities, especially the ability (inability in this case) to keep up my side of a verbal argument, it seems to always get to a point where I start realizing where I might be wrong and then I implode; so I feel that unless I am 100% correct I cannot win (I usually lose in those arguments too since the other person tends to arrogantly think they are correct anyway). I don't exactly have high self-esteem nor the willpower to just will it to existence like my brother did. Don't get me wrong, I do have willpower, but it just comes and goes at the worst of times; I'd go out my way to spend time with a friend if they are in need, but I just can't get started on that essay.
I've been told many times that I view things too much in black and white, ones and zeroes, and that I take things way too seriously/personally (even social interaction), but habits are hard to break right? I have no idea what the solution is, I doubt it can be found through a simple google search. I have tried taking things less seriously and become more lenient to halfway points (not winning 100% of the way, at least I put in effort sort of thing), but it seems during moments of high stress (work or play) I throw all that out the window whenever things are going south and it's back to square one. It almost feels like I let my guard down and as a result I let the result slip. A common example would be: while I am playing games I relax a little and enjoy the game with a few friends. Then some random player on my team says that I suck (usually after a round loss); the casual match then becomes some personal mission for me to do everything I can to prove him/her wrong so I can rub it in their face later (not verbally of course). This puts a lot of stress on something that is meant to be a relaxing activity. The thing is, I know that it's not a healthy thing to do, but I do it impulsively (explosively) and usually I can't control it although I am aware of my actions. It usually ends badly as I tend to set impossible expectations for myself but still be disappointed if I don't reach them. 
I probably said enough, I could go on for ages but I doubt fellow redditors would want to read such a long post (especially if it's a rant). I don't really expect much from this post, nor do I know what response I want to see (just like how I don't know what I expect my family or friends to say after hearing my rants), but at least I got it out."
2492,isfp,"Hey, I'm so sorry you are going through all this. I have four kindof points that I would have screamed at myself five years ago when I was in university, so I guess I'll now take the opportunity to volley them at you...
1). Depression/anxiety/existential crises during college are common and, sadly, normal. Remember that this is a stage in your life. It is not the only one, and honestly is not even the most important one (although it feels like it because... You're in it). I was SHOCKED to read some of my personal writing from college, just three years out. It was full of unbridled and casual, flippant rage. I feel none of that now.
2). Some schools and departments are better about this than others... College is not a competition. You and your classmates are all in this together. Reach out to people you feel jealousy towards; they may actually share insecurities with you or tips and tricks to accomplish the same thing. Put your finger on which direction your department leans (competition between students or community) and strive, strive for community. Nobody is as secure and put together as they would like you to think. You are NOT the only one struggling with x, y or z, not by a long shot. The more healthy friendships and networks you have, the more chance you have of a successful friend extending an opportunity to you which could not have been attained otherwise. If you think you can be successful on your own... You are dead wrong. I missed a lot of opportunities right out of the gate because I was such a lone wolf. 
3). Counseling is generally available depending on the university. Please, please look into it; it will help you analyze how your opinion of yourself affects your opinion of others. It is always more helpful to describe your situation to a human being sitting right in front of you than to a disembodied ""community"" on Reddit. You made a post; you're aware you need help; please seek it from a source that can really HELP.
4). If it's hard to settle on a career path, perhaps speak with a professor who meant a lot to you this past year/taught a great class. It may be they have some insight into your strengths and weaknesses and may be able to direct you. It's possible that particular subject appeals to you, in which case... Keep on it.
5). I lied, there are five points. Snuggle a cat."
2493,isfp,"I used to be this way but a little bit less extreme. What helped for me was 1. Maturity 2. Discovering my personality type 3. Taking intellectual classes with a good professor (English, sociology, etc.) 4. Learning to relax. 
The world isn't running away from you so why try to be a step ahead of fate. Once I discovered my personality type and what parts of me I was suppressing through classes and stress I started becoming a Very relaxed person. 
I know this is anecdotal but I feel like this could strongly help you.
Start off by taking the time each day to relax, listen to some relaxing music, maybe research something. Your brain will take you the rest of the way. 
Good Lord I sound like a hippie."
2494,isfp,"I also get overwhelmed when stressed, i freeze and i struggled a lot in my studies due to this. I got counselling and just got some relaxation techniques aswell as stratagies to deal with  stressful situations. 
I also understand what you mean with the sensitivity. I am very emotional and unfortunately the world does not think it is ""manly"", but it does not help that you become anger about it. I had to just accept it, i dont flaunt it but im not ashamed of it. 
Then a good way to be more mentally healthy is to be physically healthy, also (this is going to sound horrible but) get a routine or time table for the day and stick to it. This helped me when i was stressed and didnt want to do anything. I use never study and was distracted by anything (i use to make tracks for track mania for hours). 
Hope this helps, welcome to ask questions. Oh and we are all friendly and helpful here. "
2495,isfp,"I relate completely to everything you said. I tested the same as you on 16 personalities, and I was in your boat back when i was in college (even now, too). I felt like i existed in a constant state of apathy and indecisiveness, unable to focus on tangible goals and unable to get myself excited for anything. Sometimes my reactions to things are plagued by anxiety or impulse, making me feel untrue to myself.
Recently I've been googling all I can about my type, and found some ideas that helped me understand myself a lot better. If you can, read up on the functions of the mbti types and isfps. I found that I was in something called the Introverted feeling, introverted intuition loop (Fi-Ni loop). Basically i lived inside my head, letting my fears, doubts, emotions run rampant. But isfps are sensation driven people, and in order to get out of this, I learned that i had to get back in touch with the world by doing things, going places, seeing, touching, feeling. The comments that mention meditation are good advice. Learn to clear your head and become present in the moment. Using your extraverted sensing (Se) will feel very much like this and help you feel more focused and aware. This felt like the missing piece of the puzzle for me. I started reading more books recently, and it's expanded my mind and given me topics to talk about. I realized a lot of anxiety and stress stemmed from not knowing things outside of my own mind, which lead to me being unsure of myself. But the more i put myself out there to see and learn new things, the more confident i felt because i knew that i had the experience to back it up. Some things might take time and growing up before it becomes apparent, such as finding your career niche and passion. But set goals for yourself and start doing them. Honestly, life is just you running new iterations until you settle somewhere you like, so it's okay if you don't always get things right the first time.
It's been a few years out of college, and i don't think I've ever been more sure of myself, but it's not perfect by any means. I've felt significantly better within the past few weeks alone by compulsively learning about isfps. Part of it was just being able to identify some things i've felt were missing but never understood. If you like podcasts, Personality Hacker has some good topics pertaining to your type as well as others. I like thinking of mbti as your stats/class in the game of life, and when reframed in this way, all i wanted to do is to level up and get better at what i am. Anyway, apologies for the long response, i just really resonated with what you posted. Good luck!"
2496,isfp,"Did not expect such a quick reply, let alone a reply in the first place. I've never done meditation before, I guess I never put the time into actually considering it although I have read about it. If I may ask, how is meditation performed properly?"
2497,isfp,"Thanks for the reply. I guess it's about time I mature in this aspect and start paying more attention to the things that make me unnecessarily stressed/overreact. I do agree having a good professor helps with focusing in class, but I definitely need to figure out what I like rather than just identifying what I dont like. Relaxing is usually one of the things I forget to do especially during heated/stressful activities."
2498,isfp,"definitely resonate with the overwhelming part and 'stress gaming'. Sometimes it helps, but there are definitely days where I don't feel relaxed when playing games even with friends. I always wondered where these issues all started, my best guess would be to do with my lack of self-confidence (which kind of dropped over time as I loathed my younger 'show-off' and 'arrogant' self)."
2499,isfp,"Thanks for the post. I never would've expected so many people that share or shared the same (seemingly pointless) struggles, I guess everyone is on the same boat after all. Always nice to hear from somebody who went through something similar and is further along in their career/life. I guess time and patience is what I need to allow myself to indulge on, rather than avoid. I definitely agree with the physical interaction part. Sometimes I find that working out or playing basketball with or without friends helps alleviate some of the anxiety I feel during that day, but having recently moved to australia for college sort of but a barrier to those comfort activities (mostly due to price and location). Now I just do my best to keep in contact with my close friends on campus by keeping my schedule fairly flexible so I can easily spend time with them. I haven't really set and pursued a concrete goal since my earlier high school years (to which I still had a relentless work ethic), maybe I just worry too much about every decision because I always think that I should've gotten my life together by now and that I'm now falling behind. Speaking of loops, I've been stuck in the loop of 'going with the flow' and 'force the flow elsewhere', so to speak; basically my fluctuating willpower to 'will' myself to do things a certain way (this probably doesnt make any sense). I'm kind of scared of going with the flow because I don't know where it will take me, should I even be worried about this or am I just being too paranoid?
Thanks again for your kind and elaborate reply"
2500,isfp,"I think it's perfectly normal for you to be afraid of where the flow takes you. The fact that you're well aware of how you feel and the circumstances that surround you is already a positive thing. Also, you might find it helpful to look into INFPs. You said that you have many different pursuits depending on what you're currently inspired by, and that you devote tons of energy into this. This kind of sounds like extraverted intuition as well, and the two types are very similar."
2501,isfp,"Yeah I definitely see what you mean. I guess I do actually demonstrate some of the characteristics of the INFP, such  as filtering everything through a certain set of values, being altruistic, sometimes too much so that I end up being too gullible, passionate when something catches on. I definitely feel that I take a lot of things too seriously/personally, I always thought it had something to so with my competitive nature. Funnily enough, I actually tested as an INFP the very first time I did any mbti tests (before testing consistently as an ISFP, I do resonate more with INFP though, im creative but not necessarily artistic)."
2502,isfp,"Yeah, the more I think about it now, the more I feel Ne can explain a lot of the uncertainty and indecisiveness we feel. It instills wonder and exploration, but also self doubt. I feel your original post makes a lot of sense when viewed through the lens of Ne. I actually tested as ISFP before, but lately I test as INFP, so I've been grappling between the two as well. I wish you the best of luck in figuring this out!"
2503,isfp,"Breathe,
acknowledge what was said or done that might have hurt them
breathe again.
Think of possible words to use to observe their point of view.
empathize and then possibly apologize for the outcome of your behavior or words. Be aware of your gut and think of the next likely outcome to happen as the result of your behavior, words said cannot be undone.
If they aren‚Äôt saying anything to let you know that you hurt their feelings then it is an unfortunate situation. It could eventually unfold in a slight situation, breaks the camels back, and that unstable fuel from before is being used to harm you. Probably would‚Äôve been less severe if they had addressed it when it hurt them. You can‚Äôt really do anything at that stage, until they grant you a glance into their introspection. Observe them closely and if they‚Äôre acting any different, distance yourself. They may be disinterested continuing with you until they sort themselves, if they‚Äôre acting similarly then continue along, but keep your eyes open, let them be comfortable to tell what hurt them, if they need to.
Are you sure you actually hurt they‚Äôre feelings? Do they have a reason to be upset in the first place? If so, then just try to be neutral about it while respecting their feelings. "

Hey there, ISFPs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ISFP) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance!

There is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs the Big 5 - is MBTI as valid, do they correlate (1, 2), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)
You can take the Big 5 test here
(it's free, the $29 ""cost"" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click ""no thanks"")
Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.
Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

From wikipedia:
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.
From a peer-reviewed paper::"
2505,isfp,"Isfp

Openness: 65%
Conscientiousness: 17%
Extaversion: 10%
Agreeableness: 83%
Neuroticism: 25%

If I may ask, is this study to validate previous studies on the correlation between the two or is the goal to make new/different conclusions from the data?
Edit: Also is there a short hand way of saying your big 5 type like mbti uses 4 letter combinations?"
2506,isfp,"Hi friends,
There has been research done on this topic by similarminds.com. It has a lot of interesting info like correlation strength and two different big 5 makeups as they compare to different MBTI personality types. If you click on each one, it gives you some broad descriptions of personality traits and career choices. They're pretty harsh on neurotic people IMO. Check it out."
2507,isfp,"Isfp


Openness: 67% ""Moderate""


Conscientiousness: 57% ""Moderate""

The pie chart's largest part for me is ""Empathic Idealist"" "
2508,isfp,"I was bored surfing the web today and found a cool description of ISFPs, and it rang true for me. 
Anyone else feel like they can relate to this?
ISFPs are the astute observers of life, introspective, and kind. Harmony and respect for values are so important to them.
And although trust takes quite some time to establish, once it has been, ISFPs will be solid and dependable friends.
Yes, it will take some time to really get to know the inner values of an ISFP, but the reward will be a friend for life, a friend who will proactively anticipate problems and support others.
Conversely, if trust is broken, the ISFP will walk away, no fuss, apparently passive but stubbornly refusing to engage again.
Focusing on the here and now, ISFPs will live life to the fullest, cherishing the present moment, and find real pleasure in sensory and practical activities, such as painting or handicrafts.
They need an inner balance, a kind of karma for their lives, and this means keeping things as uncomplicated as possible.
This need for balance and harmony may mean, however, that ISFPs put off a decision until the decision is made for them.
Being so present-oriented, they may neglect to plan or even try to glimpse into the near future, preferring to take life as it comes.
Planning and control are not for ISFPs; they much prefer to stay in the background doing the things they like, keeping a balance, which of course includes choosing to remain happily disorganized."
2509,isfp,"Another thing I would add is that procrastinators are also found to be more creative. So while procrastination is a weakness, there is the other side of the coin, which is creativeness. Hearing about that, I can see how there are some redeeming qualities and not just being focused on the negatives."
2510,isfp,"Yes - it sounds like me too. For those unmarried folks, it is good to know these things before you marry, you can choose someone who compliments you and who has strong traits that we may lack - and vice versa!!"
2511,isfp,"I hear many isfps go through phases of getting obsessed with a hobby for a period of time. I could paint for 6 hours straight but that's the only thing I have any patience for. For anything else, my attention span is about 30 seconds."
2512,isfp,"Well, I've probably been in an Fi-Ni loop for many years, so I'm extremely clumsy and unaware of my surroundings. (I'm extremely compulsive though, and chronically impatient.)
I'm not physical at all. No sports or activities, no hugs.
What's charisma?
I'm conservative. (Although, as a whole it's not fair to assume someone's type by their beliefs and vice versa.)
I don't argue online about my beliefs cause it's pointless. Nobody's gonna change their minds from a stranger screaming in their faces."
2513,isfp,"I get really analytical, cynical, objective, and nit-picky whenever I pick up on bad spelling, bad grammar, blatant hypocrisy, cheap emotional manipulation, petty favoritism, or inconsistent characterization. "
2514,isfp,"Some people compulsively think about the future and the past, or are processing ideas in their mind (rather than focusing their full attention on what's around them), or have a restless internal monologue.  
You walk through the woods, are you thinking about the conversation you had yesterday with Jennie, or are you listening to the birdsong, feeling the weight shift between your feet, smelling the aroma of pine resting in the air?  
(Personally, I switch between them [I guess depending on what my hormones are doing]. But I can trigger different mental states through e.g. movement; or reading).  

Look at someone like Jerry Seinfeld. He's not enjoying what's going on around him, he's like a machine trying to figure out how to turn it into a bit. That said, he loves his cars, and probably gets his relief from his machinations through driving."

2516,isfp,"My best friend of 15 years is isfj. Shes the best! Very witty and smart, caring, goofy, fun, responsible, compassionate. The only problems we had while living together for 2 years was she used to sneak into my room while i slept to throw out my beer bottles and collect dirty dishes. I didnt want her to but it just bothered her that much that they were there. Also she hated that i never closed the kitchen cabinets. But we get along amazingly and always have fun. I love that ginger cutie pie."
2517,isfp,"My dad is an ISFJ. He's one the most selfless people I know. He works long hours and comes home and still does stuff around the house. Family is everything to him. He doesn't say much, he lets his actions speak for him. He's always on the move. If there's nothing for him to do I swear he'll still find something that needs to be done. He doesn't ask for much, either. Give him a grill and he's happy lol. I seriously hope I'm half the man he is some day.
Coincidently, I also now have an ISFJ roommate. I see the similarities between him and my dad. Constantly staying busy. Not much of a talker. He's very relationship dependent, though, always needing someone to be there. Perhaps he needs to be doing something for someone else, like fulfilling a sense of duty? He does have a bit of an ego, though. And quite temperament. We clashed in the beginning, but we've adjusted. When I first met him he came across as very selfish. But the more you get to know him you start to notice that selflessness thats in there, which I think he tries to hide. Maybe because he's still young and a little insecure? He's good people, though. I know if I had an emergency and called him he would do all he can. "
2518,isfp,"When I listen to certain songs, both instrumental or lyrical, I tend to just sit back and let certain ‚Äúscenes‚Äù like action sequences play out in my mind to the music; they usually range from sequences with fictional characters, original characters, or some strange amalgamation of both. To my fellow ISFPs, do any of you do the same thing and if so, what kind of music and what kind of ‚Äúscenes‚Äù play out for you?"
2519,isfp,"I've always trying to understand myself. I often think about what kind of person I am, reflecting on who I once was, who I am now and who I'll be in the future. Some people define themselves purely through labels, but once you strip away those labels, nothing remains. Labels can be useful but somewhat limiting. I prefer to look at my life in stages, especially the major life events and periods that have impacted me. I ask myself, who am I now? Who will I be tomorrow? How have things changed? I've been many people throughout my life. It sounds cheesy but I'm not the same person I was a year ago.
Se users are observant, action orientated and also tend to have high self efficacy. Some non Se users view us as mindless and hedonistic. Can you hate a person for liking the good things in life?!? In truth Se-Ni can make ISFP's an unstoppable force. There are many times where I've doubted my ability to achieve my goals or cope with something and yet something compels me to keep going. I know there is something beyond what I am experiencing and that the future holds something better for me. I tell myself ""Don't be so pathetic, pull your socks up and keep going"". "
2520,isfp,"I'm in an unhealthy Fi-Ni loop. Let me tell you-- it feels like being under the ocean. Even though we have secondary Se, we suppress it unconsciously sometimes. I've always had problems with daydreaming since I was little, before the Fi-Ni loop. Usually my daydreams are about fighting injustices with superpowers or creating stories and characters within these stories (think the Secret Life of Walter Mitty movie). Sometimes I do this when I work and I can't stop it! Other times, I just feel tired and dazed, always sleepy (but I can't go to sleep), and there's just not much in my mind, but my mind isn't really interacting with the world. I'm not here. Sometimes I confuse my dreams with reality. I'll be awake and I'll remember a nightmare that seemed real, and actually panic because I thought it actually happened. It's funny because I have very realistic dreams (Se?). What can you expect from a loop with two introverted functions-- they're not good with keeping in touch with the world.
The Fi-Ni comes out with my existentialist crisis. We want to live a moral life that is reflective of the truth. But what is the truth? What if there is no truth? It also feeds my interest in esoteric things like tarot cards and astrology (my Fi-Ni loves symbolism) and literature with a lot of esoteric symbolism and Ni-like instances. In Heart of Darkness, he describes crew members on a boat suddenly going to sleep. Most people wouldn't think he was describing their deaths. I wrote an essay on this book relating to morals (Fi) too, supported by a lot of Ni symbolism. I like to connect two seemingly unrelated things, like magic and sex. My Fi-Ni likes to read some Aleister Crowley sometimes.  "
2521,isfp,"I feel I can be many different persons. They are not totally different ofc, but at times I am withdrawn and totally immersed with my happy thoughts. Almost smiling for myself. Looking forward to get away from what I am currently doing, dreaming of coming home to my family. To my computer games. To the company of just myself and ppl I really love. And basically to a place where nobody demand anything at all from me. 
Other times I am extremely extroverted, and a few ppl have thought I had ADHD. Almost all of those occasions have been under the influence of alcohol. 
Today I saw some mountains and some late snow on them. Quite a scenery. It brought tears to my eyes and I felt so much in love with life. And it's not that I want to go to those mountains. The magic is all in my head, and actually going to them can possible break the immersion and spell. "
2522,isfp,"Unicorn, unicorn, potato-man with a lightsaber. 
Like 80% of the stuff in my head is either series, anime or movies. I have stopped trying to understand what goes on in my head, because most of it is not that important and I feel it is just for my entertainment. My thoughts tend to jump around. I started to focus more on how the thought makes me feel and then I interpret the feeling with meaning rather than trying to interpret the thought. Seems to work for me. "
2523,isfp,"To me the plot of the movie stands out as a book author utilizing the agency of an androgynous ‚Äònobody‚Äô to sell more books by sparking curiosity as she flexes this nobody as the author themself. 
So basically, this book author tells this person, aight I own u now, ur my IRL social avatar. Dress this way, and reap the rewards of fame that come along with, but you basically can‚Äôt ever life your own life because the world will find out. Aight. 
as an isfp, what do you make of this?"
2524,isfp,"Getting my first car, a car I always dreamed to have and can only afford used. I can afford the car insurance, gas, etc., but despite that I am stressed out over the large bills that I will now be paying. I don't know why it winds me up so much but I worry about not being able to pay it/something bad might happen. It's a committment."
2525,isfp,"Not much. I recently moved out and it really wasn't as stressful as I thought it was going to be. I think that's because my previous living situation was far more stressful than the stress of moving out. Plus I have a lot of help. But stuff like paying bills does make me anxious, but I don't stress about it."
2526,isfp,"Change is usually exciting to me. I look forward to it. But then when it comes to committing to that change, I start to second guess it and I obsessively start doing research and asking for opinions/experiences of others to help put my mind at ease."
2527,isfp,10/10 MBTI typing skills there.
2528,isfp,"ENTPs weakest functions are our opposites‚Äî Fi and Se. So, you‚Äôre right. They tend to stereotype too much before knowing people. They label people they don‚Äôt really like as a certain type they THINK they wouldn‚Äôt like. They rely more on what they already think they know than what they can see. And they might let ONE bad experience color their entire perception of a type. So don‚Äôt let it get to you. Obviously they don‚Äôt know you. They‚Äôre just ranting. "
2529,isfp,"I mean some of the comments were already pretty outrageous but I lost it at we're not spiritual and we're some of the most materialistic types... what? I mean sure SOME of ISFPs can be materialistic (and sometimes it's not even a bad thing), but I sure as hell am more spiritual. (I mean, just because I don't like hypotheticals and talking endlessly about concepts doesn't mean I'm not spiritual) Don't know where they get those conclusions from. 
ENTPs sure like analyzing others' behaviors but they don't really like analyzing their own, do they?"
2530,isfp,"I'm an INTJ female currently dating an ISFP male for 5+ years and it's ridiculous to generalize like this. Some things are not dependent on personality types and are a habit, which can be learned and unlearned. "
2531,isfp,"That‚Äôs what a lot of them said, ‚Äúthey test as XXXX, but they‚Äôre definitely ISFP.‚Äù I know mistyping can happen, but not for Every. Single. Person. 
I like having deep philosophical conversations, and while my imagination isn‚Äôt superb, I can still come up with a lot of original ideas. I can put my own twist on ideas others have and improve it in some form or another. "
2532,isfp,"My best friend is an ENTP and we've talked about that.  For him it's more that he has no idea who he is and has to work at looking at himself, which makes sense since he doesn't have Ni in is primary functions. "
2533,isfp,"For the record, I'm ISTP not ISFP. And the reason I am disgusted is not that it offends me personally. It is disgusting because of how utterly closed minded they are being, and how many blanket statements are made. Also most ISFPs aren't overly emotional. The majority are Enneagram 9 (like an infj) it's just that there are also a significant number of type 4s which are probably the ones out there making a bad name for the rest."
2534,isfp,"Did you read that disgusting bit about you guys being ""fake artists"" ? Ugh immature ENTPs are pretty much the worst. (Although mature ones who have their morals straight are great )
""However I wouldn't really say they are not artistic, but they're definitely not creative or original."" wtf???"
2535,isfp,"I‚Äôm not an artist in the sense of painting or drawing, I suck at those, but I can write a computer program pretty darn well. I consider coding an art, and I can make the code itself look pretty. I can also take pretty good pictures, I‚Äôm not professional, but I know some techniques that make them look good
here‚Äôs a picture someone else took 
and here is one that I took at the same place and same time "
2536,isfp,"I have had this ""nice guy"" syndrome for most of my life. Until I decided to change and train myself to change that and be less emotional since summer 2016. Now people don't consider me this nice guy anymore. In fact....people think I am too cold sometimes. 
Any of you relate to this? Not like I wanted to change, I had to. People seem to take kindness for weakness. "
2537,isfp,"I can totally relate to this... I remember when I was a in high school a ""friend"" asked me ""why are you always smiling?"" Like it was a bad thing. I remember I consciously decided to stop smiling and progressively started to act more like a thinker...weird how something so small had such a big affect on me. Now in college I'm starting to recover and accept that it's ok to have feelings."
2538,isfp,I tested as an INTJ until high school because I was hardcore suppressing my feelings. I love my INTJ friends! But once I got more comfortable and okay with actually caring about stuff then it's like a switch flipped. Consistent ISFP now.
2539,isfp,"In public I probably look like the most anti-social person on the planet, and it doesn't help that if I'm in a situation in which I can, I will have earphones in because if I don't I'm overly self-conscious. I always feel like people see me as some sort of freak or weirdo.
When I'm with close friends and family I'm usually pretty easygoing and expressive."
2540,isfp,"I feel for you. I've always thought that if I were a guy, I would have it pretty rough because society is a lot more accepting of females being nice and having feelings than guys. If I were a guy I'd probably do the same as you, but it sounds like it might not be healthy in the long run. "
2541,isfp,"My change came from a close friend of mine pushing me to my limits every single day. I finally took a stand for myself and refused to take any shit from him after over two years of dealing with this. Out of literally nowhere, he dumped our friendship calling me all sorts of awful names and terms claiming that I was manipulative and that I was turning our other friends against him so I would be his only friend (I know now he was projecting his own feelings of himself onto me). It ended badly. I wish him well and hope he is doing good but I never wish to be his friend again. 
Change is a good thing. Embrace it. Those who don't like it aren't worth your time. "
2542,isfp,"Glad somebody made this post. I've become a hardcore thinker out of out necessity for my job, insecurity about my intelligence and because I've had so much more free time to think (having a hard time making friends after moving across the nation for a job)
Every day feels like I'm playing the role of someone I want to be but am not yet qualified for. My emotions are completely suppressed and I approach social interaction from a detached, judgemental, hyper rational standpoint. It's caused me a lot of personality crisis and anxiety since I can't fool myself, I'm changing and not very fulfilled about it
I used to have a ton of close friends, I was always the high-energy jokester than people liked being around, but could also share deep emotional conversations. 
I think this is mostly the consequence of my environment though"
2543,isfp,"I'm pretty cheerful, even when I'm feeling gloomy inside. I repress my feelings so I won't suffer like I did in the past, so I used to consider myself a natural thinker, until I got into therapy and read a bit about psychology and stuff. Still not ok with my feelings.
You can still change, and become kind but strong. It's slow but it's possible."
2544,isfp,"Haha, for real? I remember a class mate asking me the exact same thing, ""why are you always smiling?"" To be fair I'm glad he pointed it out. In my case it wasn't genuine and I realised pretty quickly that such people pleasing habits weren't working."
2545,isfp,"This is me too. Total INTJ when I am in feeling-stuffing mode, usually when I'm not feeling safe (most of my childhood, and almost all the time at work) Everything except the E/I flipped for me in college, when I experienced a disaster in the romantic realm and all the stuffing just exploded."
2546,isfp,"It's not healthy, at least not for me. Being isfp and male while living in a conservative area made growing up hard. I was always ""too emotional"" or ""basically a woman"" to others including girlfriends. I've been suppressing my emotions off and on for a while and I'm now 25 and at the point where it's exhausting to exist. "
2547,isfp,"The two things I hear most that I can attribute to me being single is that people either think I'm gay or already in a relationship. Again this is because I grew up in a conservative area where ""men are men"" and if you don't like sports then people look at you weird. Maybe a change of scenery could help both of us."
2548,isfp,"Yeah, luckily the world is changing.... one way to speed up that change would be to move to a more modernized area. There are many urban areas where nobody expects you to like sports ;D chicago is getting there if you find the right people and avoid the Bro guys"
2549,isfp,"I saw this online and found it to be very true. I am big on free thinking and being yourself, not conforming to what others want/expect of you. In fact, the more you pressure me, the more I feel the need to resist. Pushing harder results in me pushing back just as hard. Anyone else feel like this? Or am I just a rebel at heart? Please^Don't^leave^me^alone^out^here"
2550,isfp,"ISFPs kinda seem to simultaneously want to show that they're interesting/unique and express themselves while also kind of having a sort of ""middle-of-the-road"" thing about them, like, ""I'm nothing special, I'm just a person"".
(I'm an ENTP)"
2551,isfp,"This. 
I'm almost positive it's an ISFP thing, the hippie kind of mantra, that is. As much as I don't associate with hippies, ^^^Although ^^^I'd ^^^like ^^^to, ^^^it ^^^seems ^^^really ^^^chill, I'm saying that ISFP is contrary for the sake of being contrary. I always feel as though I need to distinguish myself and have some sort of title - something that I'm known for. I used to have really long, curly, thick, hair (I'm a dude) so I could be that metal guy that's really quiet with the long hair. 
You ain't alone, person."
2552,isfp,"I can SO relate to this. A lot of people try to label me as a hipster but I think that's stupid. I'm not a hipster, I just don't like conformity. Why the hell should I have to do what everyone else feels they need to do? I want to break free from the box of society and do my own thing and enjoy my life. By doing this I feel I can set an example for those who feel the pressure of conformity. 
I sound crazy but that's just how it goes for me haha. I want to try anything and everything and I want to accept everyone for who they are. I get some crap about it for being ""so weird"" but I kind of like feeling different. I don't need to be screaming for attention to feel different either. "
2553,isfp,"I guess in retrospect, I do act contrary to the popular opinion, but I don't do it for the sake of being contrary. I try to try everything at least once and if I like it, mostly regardless of the popular opinion, I make it my own.
The more someone pressures me into something, the more I resist, but I think that's common in most people, not just ISFPs. Though, the resistance may not always be apparent (e.g. Just because you say I should like a certain band and I start listening to them doesn't mean I actually like them). Then again, maybe I'm just being contrary..."
2554,isfp,"I think I have a massive blind-spot when it comes to what other people want/expect of me. 
Just an absent minded INFP. Can't do anything right. Couldn't even non-conform. Just walk around the World listening in to everyone else's sub-conscious thoughts that they misplaced. :P"
2555,isfp,"Yeesssssssssssssssssss. I always want to be different in one way or another. Usually it's my clothes, I've got some outfits most people probably consider weird.  
EDIT: Btw, I would totally smoke some weed with a hippie or two in the back of their van. Let's get baked and talk about how the government covers up shit. "
2556,isfp,"lol in college I listened to a lot of screamo, mostly because I loved the look of surprise when people realized they couldn't just put me in the ""sweet shy blonde girl"" box. I was also really upset the first time I read a portrait of an ISFP because I had no idea I was so predictable!"
2557,isfp,"Man, this hits home for me.  I've been like this for a while but since I graduated college a year ago it's all in my face.  I decided to not work(saved up money) and be a.  Then over the summer I traveled and went to a bunch of music festivals.  So many people always say ""you have to work"" or ""you went to college and you are a? go out and get a ""real"" job"", or just label me as a  in general who isn't contributing to society, etc etc.   Is it really that odd that I've dreamed of being a since I was little?  Is it that odd that I love music and the summer gives me a platform to explore that?  Yeh, I didn't work during this, but It allowed me true freedom of time.  I think someone can contribute to society in ways outside of work, but in America that paradigm doesn't seem to sit well with most people.   "
2558,isfp,"Oooh, it's so poetic and refreshing to just say it. But yes, I think a lot of the 'rules and regulations' that society has, especially for interacting with other people and general composure in public, are just plain bullshit. And the 'hipster' label? Really, guys? Who cares about stupid stereo types anyways. "
2559,isfp,"I feel the same way (contradiction to unique-ness?), This is evidenced by my previous drive to be #1 with the MP443 on battlefield (pc). After having achieved this spot, stopped kuz I know I've made a name for myself. "
2560,isfp,"I think everyone has different taste in anime. 
I can‚Äôt say this for every ISFPs but I am a sucker for anime with beautiful artstyle. ‚ÄúGarden of words‚Äù for example. The details they put into everything is like eye-porn to me. 
Amazing soundtracks is another factor. This could range from action to sad. 
Of course the story has to be great too. Does it get me excited and hyped? Does it have a lot of cool fighting scenes and smooth animation? (AoT, BnHA, Haikyuu!!, Kill la kill) 
Is it emotional and moving? 
Funny as hell?
Are the characters well developed? 
So many questions... "
2561,isfp,"KyoAni shows, especially the earlier stuff (imo their adaptations are much stronger works than their originals). They really capture the feeling of particular moments through lighting, gestures, and sound. Small things that might not mean anything by themselves, but still they're the something about a moment you just can't forget. Personal faves are the Haruhi series+movie, KEY adaptations, Hyouka.
They can lay it on a lil thick at times, to the point of coming off insincere and off-putting (cough, Kyoukai no Kanata...). But when moments in earnest shine through, it's pretty magical. They also do great physical comedy (Nichijou)."
2562,isfp,"Nothing cutesy or comedic. I'd say.. battle-royale style anime with morally gray characters instead of clear-cut protagonists/antagonists, unpredictable deaths. Examples: Juni Taisen , Gantz , X/1999 , Attack on Titan"
2563,isfp,"I like a lot of shoujo types. I really like Kimi ni Todoke (romance, high school). Maybe the main character is isfp and the main love interest perfect because he is probably Esfj. 
Card captor sakura is pretty great too. Main character from esfj with main male lead probably isfp. "
2564,isfp,"I love the ‚Äúpretty‚Äù anime‚Äôs - you know, the ones that are drawn beautifully. I also love intricate storyline anime‚Äôs and ones that pull emotions from you. Weirdly enough I‚Äôm also a sucker for shounen - I‚Äôm a gal jsyk. Some of my faves are:
FMA: Brotherhood, Barakamon, Boku no Hero, Akatsuki no Yona, Gangsta, Haikyuu, Arslen Senki, Kingdom, Death Note, Rorouni Kenshin (Ahhh Samurai X), Mushishi, Nodame Cantible, Hunter x Hunter, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, AOT, Yowamushi Pedal... etc etc.
Taking a look at my list though - it‚Äôs pretty eclectic. I just like a little bit of everything."
2565,isfp,"Fuck man, too true. I love watching anime, and prefer subbed, but I just find myself browsing Reddit on the side, or fiddling with something and getting generally distracted from the show way too often..."
2566,isfp,"I just have one online college course right now and I'm having difficulties keeping up. Then I never feel like I can go anywhere or do anything because I should be doing school work.... Ugh... I'm getting lazy again. Lol, anyone else?"
2567,isfp,yeh i have low tolerance for doing stuff too. its like everything requires effort for me and college takes lots out of me. i mostly jus stay in my dorm when im not in class or library or w/e. unless i get invited somewhere i dont do shit lol. eventually i get where i need to see someone tho after bout a month of bein a recluse.
2568,isfp,"Think of it as if it were about not giving up and following your true goals. 
‚Äã
The meaning is that, sometimes something is there for the exact opposite that what you think, but you have to be constant and patient to not put that thing away from your life at the wrong time. If you're patient, you will be rewarded, but if not, you will suffer unnecesarily and also lose important life parts.
‚Äã
Think about things you don't want to do. If you manage to do them anyway, then you will have a new experience and something in your hands. But if you give up and run away to avoid that uncomfortable feeling of the moment, then you will never know what was in the end and what are you loosing."
2569,isfp,"This might be a long post, however I guess I just need to let it out. I'm on mobile, so hopefully my autocorrect doesn't fail me too often
I'm basically at a major crossroads. I learned that (to the best of my knowledge), I'm an ISFP, from the book, ""Do what you know""
I'll explain my personality related to my work, and also my current job situation
I worked in construction, hated it, and now work as an estimator in construction. I realize it just isn't for me, my current job, and construction in general. I have no interest in it. 
There are several reasons I don't enjoy it.
1) The work itself doesn't interest me
2) I'm not good at it
3) It requires a lot of ""figuring out stuff on your own"", as opposed to a traditional training course.
4) I get bored easily, especially if I don't understand or care for something. It takes a ton of willpower to keep focus on the job at hand most days.
Now how my brain works:


Awful short term recall. If you tell me how to do something, I'll almost immediately forget, and if I right it down I might forget the context or even what I wrote down in general anyways. 


I'm not very organized, and this job can require a lot of jumping around from one thing to another. This creates frustration as well as confusion if I'm told something. Im much slower at processing information (The ""Thinking"" personality trait), so if I'm told something, the gears in my head don't quite churn, but I'll just do what I'm told anyways, even if I don't understand, and don't have time to get more complex. I could be told something, but it might not actually register/make sense for an hour, day, or even week later


Im not good at ""figuring things out"" a lot of the time, or veering off the path of what should be done to do the job. What I mean by this is (And this relates to not having a lot of knowledge in the field) is that I need to be told how to do something, if you told me how to think about doing it from a certain perspective, it's a lot more difficult for me to remember. I NEED structure and a system. Figuring things out is not my strength. The best way to explain it is my mind is like  a blank computer. I need to be given explicit instructions on what to do, if you said ""I want you to open Microsoft word"", I'd be lost. I need the exact computer.programming to do it, if that makes sense.


Im not confident in my ability AT ALL. I second guess EVERYTHING. Even if I think I know the answer, or have a solid opinion, or have a question (as it relates to work), I'm going to ask myself 100 times first in my head to make sure Im not asking a dumb question, or make sure I haven't asked it before, or make sure Im not saying something wrong


If I don't understand something, and I'm too afraid to ask what it means, or if I just can't wrap my head around it, I give up. I'll just go on Reddit. Even if there's a deadline ahead, I don't treat it as, I have to ""buckle down"". I'll browse the computer, and throw in work as I go.


A lot of the job involves calling vendors, calling project managers about questions, etc. This is MAJORLY out of my comfort zone. Again, I always feel as though my question is dumb, and I'm wasting.my time asking. I assume I SHOULD know, so if I have to ask, then there's something I'm not understanding.


There mght be more I'm forgetting. But that's the gist
My personality:


Most days I feel as though I'd like a career helping people. But then I get nervous about if it pays enough. Then I get paranoid that ""Maybe that won't actually be the career I want"", and I lose all motivation to change careers. Constant indecision. 


I'm not a big communicator. I'm not good at explaining how I feel or what I want to achieve. 


I'm  a very bad long term thinker. I don't want to think in the future. It's tiring and annoying to me. I get exhausted trying to think about the future in terms of career, where I want to be, etc.


I keep to myself. I'm a hermit. Besides my wife, I don't hang out with people unless I get to know someone. Even then I have no ""real friends"". Just people I might hang out with if I'm bored.


I have high expectations in myself IF ITS SOMETHING I CARE ABOUT. I don't care about.my job, do I dont have too high of expectations. If I don't understand something, ""Oh well."" But I love to play football. If I don't make a play when I'm playing pickup or flag football, it will bother me all week. Just 1 play, or the whole game.


I don't like expressing my feelings because I always assume people will just be annoyed. So besides to my wife and even her sometimes, I just keep my feelings to myself. And unless someone asks me first, I won't initiate hanging out with friends. So if I wanted to go watch football one night with some friends, I won't call them. If they don't ask me to go out with them, I won't go, because I won't ask them first. Again, I feel as though I'm bothering them, and if they wanted to hang out with me, they'd call first.


If I understand something as it relates to work, I'll get this small ""spark"" work hard, then it dies down, and will go away completely if a new challenge comes up.


My hands are starting to hurt from texting, so I'll wrap up. 
I'm not sure what career I should change into, but I need to change. I know a lot of ISFP people get into art, mostly to express themselves, but that doesn't sound like me at all. Are there any jobs that would relate to how I explained myself? As do I sound like an ISFP at all anyways?
I love thinking about how the world and brain work, like quantum's mechanics and neuroscience and stuff, but I don't have the brain for it, and am paranoid if I could even get a job for it. I'm getting mentally exhausted even tho king about going to school for a degree, let alone how long it's take, and the work involved to be either.of those, or even a career change in general. All I know is I'm drained, bored (Think I need something not very routine at work, idk), etc. At my current career.
Sorry for the long, all over the place.post.Just kind of typing as I think.
Any advice helps
Thank you"
2570,isfp,"It's not uncommon with anxiety disorders/HSP and ADHD symptoms making you scatterbrained, exhausted by social interaction and/or worried about the future. There can be a lot more to a persons personality than their personality type.
If you are really doubting your personality type then maybe John's personality test could help you? 
Just to get a generalized view of other potential types"
2571,isfp,"Sounds like maybe you're low on confidence? I certainly have that problem, and then anything which is challenging I just lose all interest in, partly because I'm super lazy, but mostly because if I don't try my hardest I won't be disappointed if/when I fail.
You say you'd like to help people, and also like to figure out how people's brain work - how about training to become a counsellor, therapist or psychiatrist? :)"
2572,isfp,"A lot of things I relate to here, especially the indecision, second-guessing everything and feeling nervous to ask questions because you feel as though you should know the answer (probably this is just low self-esteem or anxiety though), not being a big communicator or expressing feelings, only having high expectations with certain things. I would say ISFP, possibly INFP. I'm definitely leaning towards ISFP because your tendency to get bored with routine seems much more Se over Si."
2573,isfp,"Thank you. Took the test. It was hard because I'm so indecisive, but it came up 55% ISFP. 
I always thought I had ADHD or SOMETHING, but my doctor and psychiatrist disagreed, but I never had testing. Still think I do though."
2574,isfp,"The indecision kills me
I THINK I want to be a physical therapist assitant or something related, but then in my head I go
""Well maybe you WON'T like it, you gotta pay for school, maybe you'll have to work weekends which you don't like, the environment might not be how you want, you're probably not smart enough"", etc.
Pretty frustrating. Kills any and all motivation"
2575,isfp,"That sounds like an awesome job! 
But yeah I totally get the frustration with not being sure if what you think you want is what you really want, whether you would truly enjoy it, whether you'd even be able to achieve it. I envy those who can be so confident in what they want. I think sometimes we just need to push past our doubts and just go for it. :)"
2576,isfp,"I have felt this way for a while. When I'm single I'll get very lonely at times. When I feel this way I'll start using my imagination and either draw up emotions and memories from past relationships or make them up myself. This will slowly lead to me getting horny, ""fixing"" that urge, and then completely shutting off thinking to myself ""why did I do that?"". Maybe it's just the fact that I'm 20 years old and all my past relationships have been less wholesome and more horny all around. This all just leads me to think ""was that all I'm good for? Satisfying myself and then completely shutting down? Not caring about the person I'm close with? Was it all for me?"" I'm not sure. I guess I just haven't met to right person yet to challenge my need for sexual contact. I wonder if my loneliness is the natural side of me, seeking love and true companionship; while the hormone prone pubic me turns that loneliness into lust, sexual need, and eventually anger. I can't wait for this puberty shit to go away. 
Anyway thank for readying my post masturbation neurological insight."
2577,isfp,"I feel that! Well, kind of. It's kind of like when your horniness leads you to have a hookup at all costs, but then you end up somehow feeling attached to the person afterwards and feel lonely if they ignore you later on. Or maybe that's something different entirely!"
2578,isfp,"You are right it is not what he wanted for us. Before Adam and Eve disobeyed God we were not born into sin, thus not have a sinful nature. Sexual acts are not supose to burden us or make us feel alone, etc. It should be to bind us. Its sin because when it is done outside the context tha God wanted us to do it, it is usd to make us feel shame and empty and lonely, etc. 
But I do not want to argue about this, it is pointless on Reddit. I just gave my view on the matter. "
2579,isfp,"I think this, because I am who I am, I grew up as an extremely wholesome kid. Doing nothing wrong in school and being borderline repressed because everyone else was a rebel. Acting like a 60 year old man the second I hit a spec of maturity. I've been in one serious relationship and she was a racist ignorant b**** that I saw right through for the things that I wanted to see; love, companionship, trust. In reality she was just not the person for me because she didn't try to understand me. Also because at the time I didn't understand myself and thank God I do now. Being a ISFP, we are super realistic and rely a lot on trust. If I'm going to date someone your ass better be in the same now or never mindset, otherwise the door is over there."
2580,isfp,"I am noticing more that I struggle when it comes to social interactions. It isn't because I don't like them, but because it seems like I don't have anything to talk about.
Does anyone have any advice on how to break through this barrier?"
2581,isfp,I notice this too. I'm usually comfortable in my silence though. I'd rather save talking for when I actually have something to say. I think the key is the people you surround yourself with. I don't talk much in big groups but I can have endless conversations with a couple of close friends.
2582,isfp,"If you can play more of the listener that's actually something people love. You can contribute occasionally with how you agree/disagree, but people find it refreshing to have conversations where someone really just listens. This is especially true when it comes to one on one conversations with women. Just because you feel you don't have much to say, doesn't mean you're not contributing."
2583,isfp,"I am the same way! I have trouble with small talk, so I try to ask other people about themselves which seems to break the ice for me. One of my big problems is when people ask me things about myself. ""What do you do for fun?""
""I don't know, watch netflix and walk outside sometimes?""
I just feel like I'm boring to other people lol.
Edit: a word"
2584,isfp,"I'm 32 and still have this problem. What helps me be less self-conscious about it is knowing that most other people (unlike us) reeeealllly like talking about themselves, so let them! Ask them questions about themselves, and see where that conversation leads. Being interested in other people will make you look more interesting in their eyes."
2585,isfp,"Have a hobby? talk about the intricacies of the hobby. Don't have a hobby? get one or ask around about getting one. 
You can also talk about politics, but that's rarely going anywhere unless you have a unique perspective and not just repeating the talking points that everyone else repeats.
Talk about things you notice if you're in a place with a unique decoration or scenery."
2586,isfp,"I don't tend to mind living in silence with friends so much. If you want to talk tho, I usually just ask questions about them or tell a joke and a conversation gets started. It's pretty hard, but if you have a couple questions/ jokes prepped then you can start it from there. Also look for common interests and talk those to death. That's what I do at least, but I still sit in silence regularly with a small comment intermittent while talking to a group of people."
2587,isfp,"I also have this problem. Usually, I like to stay quiet until I need/want to talk. When I feel like I have to, I just start asking the other person/people questions and if they're open to socializing, they find a way to carry the conversation as well. If not, then at least I know I can stop. "
2588,isfp,"i think that asking questions about the other people is key, people often like to talk about themself, just let them do it and you can see if you have something in common with the other, if you don't then you wont even care.
Sorry, poor english"
2589,isfp,"Idk, like if there's something you know they've been doing lately or a hobby they have, then ask them about it. Proceed with follow ups until you reach some sort of deeper topic you both enjoy. I usually lead with jokes though (usually on something I noticed in the particular situation we're in). I don't tend to like conversations about ""so have you heard what blah's doing?"" so I tend to steer clear of those. Otherwise say whatever and don't filter yourself so much (at least that's why I do)."
2590,isfp,"Personally no. I don't. I've tried getting into reading however I just couldn't. I really like this book called 'Cherub The Recruit' and the following book of the cherub series, however after the first two books I got bored. Do you like reading books? If so what are some of your favourite books? "
2591,isfp,"I LOVE reading books, even before I completely figured out how to read well enough (miner learning disabilities growing up). I would check out autio tapes with the books that had it available and read along while sitting next to my tape player (Early 2000s were a strange time). 
I love fantasy novels and that hasn't changed at all over the years. Even though I'm a strong enough reader to get lost in a good book, I no longer have the feee time. So I took a note from my younger self and use an app to read my books to me (You know the one).
As for specifics, anything under Brian Sanderson. He is an amazing writer and I just get lost in his worlds."
2592,isfp,"My favorites are A Confederacy of Dunces, The Godfather, and Out of Africa but I also read ‚Äúyoung adult‚Äù and ‚Äúwestern‚Äù genres.
I always thought *The Night Circus‚Äù was kind of an ISFP book for some reason. Dark and descriptive and romantic.
I like historical nonfiction, too. Devil in the White City was really good. 
The most recent books I read were Toby Barlow‚Äôs Babayaga and Sharp Teeth.
I ordered The Soul of an Octopus yesterday after seeing it mentioned in r/biology. 
I don‚Äôt do kindle or audiobooks but I want to. Just haven‚Äôt gotten around to it and I‚Äôm behind the times. My house has shelves in every room, like a dusty library.
‚ÄúBooks. Check ‚Äòem out!‚Äù"
2593,isfp,"Only if it‚Äôs a book with a cute couple in it that I like....
so I basically only read YA fantasy/supernatural books, the objectively bad ones with the corniest love triangles? Yeah, that trash. 
:/
I enjoyed reading assigned books in school, but for some reason i can‚Äôt sit down and force myself to finish a book (like an actually GOOD book) on my own free will. "
2594,isfp,"I looooove books for reference or with really nice art in it. I have way too many books for my own good. But I‚Äôm not the best reader. When I get on kicks of books, I am REALLY in them and happily finish a book in a day. But I haven‚Äôt done that in a while. Sometimes I miss it, but I‚Äôm also happy doing other things with my time. (Usually reading wikipedia Lol.)
Maybe my change in reading habits coincide with my watching habits. Movies are really long and I don‚Äôt do it unless I really want to watch said movie. But recently my attention span only lasts for like a show in 30 minute increments. (Which, counterintuitive, I can them binge for 10 episodes at a time. üòÖ)"
2595,isfp,"I'm not quite sure if I'm an INFP or an ISFP but books are my best friends, especially the classic ones. I almost get a sense of, ""huh, I've  met you before, havent't I?"", and I feel like books are my soulmates. Words used to string meanings together is a part of who I am, inherently. I love books like Jane Eyre, Anne of Green Gables, and currently, I'm really enjoying Katherine by Anya Seton. However, I can pretty much read any fiction book and grow an attachment to it. I may end up not loving it, but by the end, tears spring to my eyes at the thought of letting go. It feels like we have climbed the highest mountains and ventured the most tumultuous of seas together. At school, I'm probably seen as that weird loner girl sitting alone in the library completely absorbed in the pages.
Can anyone relate?"
2596,isfp,"Sometimes... but I feel like a lot of novels are written by INFXs for INFXs. I've tried reading lots of things like that which said audience loves, but I don't get at all.
‚Äã
I pretty reliably enjoy novel-like non-fiction books though, like the one about a guy who was undercover as a Hell's Angel, or that transgender girl who was at the heart of the bathroom law shit in the US."
2597,isfp,I enjoy reading children's fantasy novels just like Percy Jackson and other books from Rick Riordan and I also love to read comics and mangas all the time. Books that are either too long or just too boring are a no no for me because I often lose patience in the middle of reading the book.
2598,isfp,"I've jsut started getting into it again. personally my attention is a lot better if i hide my laptop somewhere‚Äîseems to recalibrate me back to not needing immediate gratification from reading stupid short term nonsense on the internet i won't care about 2 seconds later.  
i like the modernists and some classics. i'm in the uk, and grew up watching period dramas - it's fun going back and reading austen, bronte's, etc."
2599,isfp,"I read mostly non-fiction -- pop science or history you could say, written in a layperson-friendly way. When it comes to fiction, I prefer movies, comics, or games. Words are great for relaying concepts, but it's rare they pique my senses the way audiovisual elements do."
2600,isfp,Copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste 
2601,isfp,"Sorry if I do this wrong. I've only been on reddit for like a day. Anyway, I don't know if this is an ISFP thing, an ADHD thing, a combination or me thing but I get really overwhelmed when there's too many things going on around me. This happens a lot especially when I'm in a crowd and I get panic attacks. I was just wondering if anyone has similar experiences even if they aren't as extreme"
2602,isfp,"Not really in the same sense you're talking about, but I do in a way. If I'm listening to something, watching something, or talking to someone and a really interesting idea or concept comes up I get kinda overwhelmed. I'm seriously thinking about it and trying to follow what's going on at the same time, and I just can't, so usually what I do (if possible) is stop whatever's happening and just think in silence until that train of thought is resolved. I just can't stand the idea of something interesting coming up and not being able to think it out fully before I forget about it."
2603,isfp,"In some way yes, but it might be because of Introversion taking place. I sometimes do feel uncomfortable out a sudden in public, like when there's too much strangers in the mall for example. But I realised it occurs only when i am thinking of things that have pressure on me, for example i had been thinking of talking to girls in public and if i do think of that and i am in public, the attacks might come. I view it as this way, there's a natural flow in life, if you try to go against it, you will crash, your circuit will run differently, you will encounter issue. So laugh and smile to the flow of life :)"
2604,isfp,"I'm a Reddit newbie too, we'll figure this out together! 
I attend religious meetings twice a week - and I find it is then that everything gets too much. I feel the cold very easily, there are lots of families in our congregation so you can generally hear children whispering to parents or rustling papers etc. and I sometimes struggle to stay concentrated on what is being said - all these small things add up and sometimes I can't deal with it and have to stand outside for 10 minutes or so.
This may or may not be the answer you're looking for, but for me this is the most applicable situation that I could describe as 'sensory overload'. I don't have ADHD myself or enough knowledge to comment on how much of a correlation there is. However, since we are sensors and we pick up on small things that others tend to miss, it is no big leap to conclude that we often get overloaded by our senses and environments."
2605,isfp,"Yes I do, sometimes I get very very sensitive to noises and my senses of touch and sight and can become overwhelmed and breakdown and I'm a 21 year old male. Sometimes they do become full blown panic attacks. I also have depression and ADHD and it seems to happen more easily when I am more depressed or am feeling emotions very strongly "
2606,isfp,"I don't think I've ever experienced what you're talking about. The closest thing I get to a sensory overload is sometimes I can't touch a certain types of paper material. Even so, it's not really similar to what you're talking about, it just involves the senses. I've already started writing about it so now I can't stop hahah. It's kind of hard to explain, but it feels like nails on a chalk board to me. Writing this out feels really, really silly but there have literally been moments where it's hard for me to open the paper napkin wrapped utensils at restaurants because of the feeling it gives me. I get this weird feeling in my teeth too and I just physically cringe. Wow, i've never written this out. I sound crazy."
2607,isfp,"Hey all! So I'm a recently self-discovered ISFP (have previously mistyped as INFJ - who would've thought we were so similar to them?) and love reading all these discussions with you cool people :)
Anyway, I'm currently lost on where to go workwise: just graduated high school as valedictorian (took lots of AP classes, spent lots of times with IN--'s who I identified with academically) and was going into college planning to study math/economics to become an actuary. As someone, like all of you, trying not to drown in this increasingly STEM-oriented world, I feel like this is the smartest way to a stable income.
But like... as an ISFP, I keep feeling like that's not what life is really about. You know? Midway through senior year I became really interested in drag and female stage performers, and have subconsciously developed a really strong passion to pursue drag/art. It would be wholly fulfilling, let me express all of my creativity, and I know there wouldn't be one day that went by that I regretted choosing my path. However, there's just such a great risk associated with choosing this route - and a huge opportunity cost as well, giving up a STEM college education and basically betting my whole life on whether or not people like me enough as a performer. It's like I'm choosing between low risk-low return and high risk-high return at this point.
What do you all think? I'm so freaking sorry this text was so long, but finally having a group of like-minded people to relate to is liberating and any feedback you all have is greatly appreciated. <3"
2608,isfp,"Focusing on the success related aspects when creating art is harmful to the process. It makes the artist try and guess what other people like, when they should be really doing what they like and whoever else happens to enjoy it too is welcome.   That's when the artist can create something truly unique, because it comes from within.  
I was in the same boat as you once and this is the reasoning I came up with to justify taking the safer path.  
I don't regret my decision. My art helps me live and gives me joy. I look at the people I've met and connected with and think to myself that if I had the power to go back in time I would not use it. 
You can trust yourself to make the right decision, because no matter what the outcome, it'll have meaning. "
2609,isfp,"I think the issue is that us ISFP's are pretty grounded and realistic, but our passions are often quite artsy, so pursuing them as careers can be scary.
Personally I'm going to keep my art, music, drag stuff as a hobby and stay on the technical side for my actual career. No reason your job should define you as a person. A good work/life balance means you can still do what you want, even if it's not your job."
2610,isfp,"Hey! I get where you're coming from - I always did really well in school, not valedictorian level but pretty good. I went to my first year of college as a Biology major and I hated absolutely every second of it. I did... Not well at all. And looking back, I really only chose it because I figured it's what I HAD to choose. 
Anyways. I'm now in my second year and I'm now a philosophy major and thoroughly enjoying studying. I'm not sure where it's going to take me in life and it's terrifying to not have a plan right now. But! I'm happy so that's really all I need. (Theoretically.)"
2611,isfp,"An artistic career is an enormous ask these days.  I only committed after doing mixing on and off for ten years and being well above the competition.  Safer careers don't require even half of the same effort and they yield far more money earlier on.  But for me they weren't half as satisfying, so there are always tradeoffs and nothing will give you only benefits.
The only way the creative thing works is with insane commitment, basically the desire to be the best in the world at something (not saying that will necessarily/has to happen, but the desire must be on that level).  A lot of people fail this check.  It's not required for safer jobs whatsoever."
2612,isfp,"This is exactly how I feel.
I'm a graphic designer, and I just don't feel like I'm cut out for it. I enjoy it, but I've come to realize it doesn't pay enough, and I'm 99% sure I'm going to go back to school to learn something else. (Possibly a certificate to be an occupational therapy assistant?) I can do artistic stuff in my free time, but I don't want my livelihood to depend on my creativity, or lack thereof. Not to mention I've realized I really want to do more hands on work. I cannot stand sitting at a desk all day, every day. I like to relax in my free time, so I need my job to be what gets me on my feet since most of my hobbies involve the computer."
2613,isfp,"Almost like me, i went to computer science on college this year, but it was really bad and frustating. Now i'm working hard to go to art school. I always knew i wanted to be a designer but, as i'm not really that good at drawing, i just gave up and got frustrated. Should've followed my dream from the start."
2614,isfp,"I decided to take the test again just because I haven't taken it in a while, and I was surprised when I got ISFJ, not ISFP. So i decide to look through the description to see if there's any reason why it's different, besides the fact that my Judging and Perceiving has always been very balanced. There was one thing that resonated with me so much I knew I had to be an ISFJ.
""Given how generous Defenders are with their warm praise and support, it‚Äôs not surprising that others enjoy their company enough to call them friends. The challenge is to be considered a friend back ‚Äì people with the Defender personality type are shy and a little protective of themselves, but they also need to be able to connect on a deeper emotional level. It makes sense then that most of Defenders‚Äô friends are made not by random encounters on a wild night out, but through comfortable and consistent contact, as in class or in the workplace where they have the time to get to know each other little by little.""
The person who I'd consider my closest friend, we only met a year ago, and it was by talking to each other consistently in class everyday our friendship grew. I think after reading this I was mistyped for a while. 
As for how my results came out this time:


Introverted: 97%


Observant: 58%


Feeling: 86%


Judging: 54%


Turbulent: 64%


So i'm actually an ISFJ instead"
2615,isfp,"(I‚Äôve noticed you all have pretty refined musical tastes!)
I want the majority of the songs to be things that the crowd might know, but I also want to sneak in some relatively unknown songs that are immediately easy and fun to dance to.
Bride‚Äôs favorite bands: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, Queens of the Stone Age (this list might not be super helpful for looking for dance floor tunes)
ESTJ groom isn‚Äôt into music"
2616,isfp,I love Queens of the Stone Age!! They are great for road trips but not aren't super dancy tunes though. Try Masters of Reality - it's a related band and there are some really catchy songs. Get a hold of their album Sunrise on the Sufferbus
2617,isfp,"A bunch of songs we played at my wedding. Can‚Äôt guarantee they are danceable, but I loved the atmosphere!"

2619,isfp,"I'm a male who identifies with ISFP but am still uncertain. I've taken multiple tests, and all of them place me as IS_P, with T and F switching back and forth. The one on http://www.16personalities.com gave me 55% F, 45% T this week, and 47% F, 53% T last week
There are aspects in both ISTP and ISFP I share, and also some I completely disagree with. For example, I am highly conventional and do not spend much time thinking of new ideas. However, I admire aesthetics and am very sympathetic towards others. And yet, I do not enjoy nature and am usually not quiet or reserved. I am not an artist or a mechanic, in fact I am a mathematician and computer programmer with a love of history and foreign languages, combining both the literary and the engineering. Has anyone else experienced being between personalities?"
2620,isfp,"Hi! I'm very much an ISFP and my boyfriends tested at ISTP. We are very similar but I've noticed a few differences that might help you determine which type you identify more with. These might not be true for every ISFP/ISTP but maybe they'll help.
1. I would never go hunting (or kill an innocent animal) and my bf loves to hunt and fish
2. I don't really enjoy movies that are gory because I have a hard time not empathizing with the people in pain. My bf always tells me it's just a fake movie. I've also cried during a few movies but I don't think I've ever seen him shed a tear. 
3. We both like animals but I generally like every animal while he only likes a select few (like our pet cat). 
4. I need more social interaction than he does. He could live alone in the woods but I would miss my friends and family.
5. When we're both sitting in silence at the dinner table he thinks about machines at work while I think about the people at work (if that makes any sense). 
6. I love babies but that could just be my ovaries screaming at me lol.
Some of these things might just be male/female differences but generally I'm more sensitive. "
2621,isfp,"So I used to identify heavily with both istp, but I just recently realized that I'm actually an isfp. The two types differ in primary function in a confusing way. Istp's have primary Ti while isfp's have primary Fi. Now both of these functions are used to make internal rationalizations about thoughts, feelings and opinions, but they differ in method. Fi is used to realize the value of an action or an idea to better understand the motivation and whether or not it's genuine or correct, while Ti is used to outline the knowns and compare those to previously created logical systems, to clearly understand the present situation. See Ti desires clear uderstanding, but Fi desires honest motivations. Both are used to make rational choices independent of personal desire.
The reason I was confused for a long time about this is because even though Fi is a feeling function, the emotions used aren't the kind which will necessarily overflow or be opened up to others. They're just very sensitive to the value in the object. I didn't even notice that I was using them, that's how small my emotions are.
However, I will say that many Ti primaries share the same interests as you so based on my limited knowledge Ti makes a little more sense. However I'm a physics major :/ so Fi primaries can value logic because it creates more clarity in the rationalizations that they can also make. The answer really lies in your ability and desire to use either logic or values."
2622,isfp,"My boyfriend is an ENTJ and I‚Äôm an ISFP!!! :) I love that he tells me straight up how he feels about me. I overthink and worry so him being direct is so reassuring. It wasn‚Äôt until I got to know him better that I saw how ENTJs are so picky with who they spend time with lol! That made me feel pretty special that he let me into his circle, since he could have a MILLION friends if he wanted to, he‚Äôs so confident! Likewise I enjoy my alone time, so me wanting to spend time with him means alot too :) I was soooo afraid my huge daily dose of emotions would have him running, but he says he loves them x) He loves making plans and decisions, and I love just going with the flow (aka be lazy) so we‚Äôre a good team!! Good luck! :)"
2623,isfp,"ISFP female. For some strange reason, ENTJs feel very safe to me, like I can count on them to have my back and to put me at ease. I feel like they like to show me things, and I love being shown things. They like to dissect my value system in a way that makes me easily open up. I haven't been in any intimate relationships with them though."
2624,isfp,"ENTJs like efficiency, order, ambition.  Gifts they'd like are pragmatic, like a cordless vacuum, a sharp chef knife, a USB lighter if they're into candles for relaxation. They like cleanliness and productivity. 
If you don't take offense easily, you're in the healthy range NTs need. "
2625,isfp,"AAH. I have no advice, sorry, but seeing these budding relationship posts makes me want to meet an ENTJ already, pick their craniums apart, compare individual similarities/ differences and compatibility for friending. So.. where can I buy one of y'all?"
2626,isfp,"Haha didn't see that. So long as you're sensitive to how they're feeling, give space, and try to solve conflict with teamwork instead of logic, you should be good. Oh, and thoughtful, special gifts, over pragmatic. One more thing, post to the ISFP board lol"
2627,isfp,"[Link (Freenode IRC)] (http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#isfpreddit)
Pick a nickname and join! I'll be keeping this open for a couple days at least but there might not always be others in the room. Have fun!"
2628,isfp,"17 year-old male
I get tired of people very very fast.
I hate talking for the sake of talking.
I'm very private about my interests.
I hate fake people.
I love music. I probably listen to 5 hours of it a day. I listen to music more for the melody but I find the lyrical aspect more interesting. I mostly listen to stuff that I feel I can relate to. I'm constantly listening to albums I haven't heard yet and there's stuff I love in every genre. My favorite band's Pink Floyd.
I love video games but I play them more to appreciate them than to enjoy them if that makes sense. Graphics aren't really something I care about, almost all the games I play are from past generations.
My heart definitely controls my head. I got severely, severely depressed for almost a year over girl I never even kissed because she liked me for a tiny bit and I didn't feel disconnected from everyone else for the first time. Love's probably what I think about the most.
Making friends is incredibly hard for me. I'm still scared of people because I was severely bullied as a kid. Only friends I still have are from elementary school when making friends was incredibly easy.
I'm not interested in shallow friendships. I have four friends but I have a very deep connection with all of them. I had a traumatic childhood and so did all of my friends and I feel like they're the only people who've accepted me.
I'll sometimes become extremely reclusive. I'll stay in my bedroom with the light off and not talk to anyone for a week. I often forget to talk to my friends for weeks but they're always happy to hear from me.
I've never left the west coast in my life but I have a strong desire to see the world.
I'm intelligent but depression and laziness has caused me to have absolutely horrible grades. In 4th and 5th grade I received 100% on the really fucking long state tests in math. I was the only person to do it both times. I get straight F's though (sorry if I sound like a dickhead here, I'm not trying to brag by anonymously telling strangers I'm smart, I just think it could be relevant).
I both dislike and love almost everyone. There's people who I'll think are really cool, but I'd want to hang out with almost none of them (if that makes sense).
People think I'm pretty funny, but I have an unusual sense of humor. All my jokes are really just thoughts I have, I don't really know how to explain it. I'd never try to put someone down with a joke.
I don't do anything that I don't want to do.
All of my morals are based on my own values.
What type do I sound like?"
2629,isfp,"INFPs suffer from the Fi-Si loop. That is replaying unpleasant memories again and again. They can get out if it by learning from the past and reminding themselves the future is right here to be unfurled, and things will be different.
ISFPs suffer from the Fi-Ni loop. That is envisioning absurd possibilities and fearing them. They can get out it by vetting their worries to gain insight and getting their focus back onto the present moment and taking action to change the future, not fear it. 
So I‚Äôd wager you are an INFP. "
2630,isfp,"I've known this girl for probably 4 years. I shouldn't say I've really KNOWN her, but we have exchanged eye contact intermittently for the entirety of that period. Somewhat awkwardly, I stumbled through conversation with her, and she with me, and so we never got past small talk. The eye contact never ended however. What really won me over with this girl was that when she looked at me it was as if I were the single most important thing in the universe. When we were free to work in class, it was as if she were drawn to some singularity within me, always happening to be hovering nearby, whether through choice or by some inexplicable circumstance. It was touching, and made all the more-so with the knowledge that she is pretty much a regular genius, with a long line of family attending and even teaching at Harvard. Knowing how intelligent she was, I felt as if her stares carried a sense of gravity and sincerity that was difficult to write off as a mere casual crush. This aspect was also somewhat intimidating. I felt like she kept trying to get closer to me but I backed off each time because I didn't feel like I was good enough for her. About midway through our senior year at high school she got a boyfriend, an INFJ, which meant all contact, verbal or non, ended. I felt pretty low after that, but just two weeks later they broke up, which surprised everybody because they seemed really compatible. Those two weeks were enough for me to get over her, or so I thought, but I was always bugged by the fact that in the end there was no ultimate significance to our long history of exchanges. I really genuinely wanted to get to know her. She still had this air of mystery about her that sort of spoke to my imagination if that makes sense. On the day we graduated I asked for her number and she replied instantly and excitedly and we've been texting nonstop ever since. We talked and went on forever about things we have in common and views we share but nothing too personal or revealing has come up yet which is kind of disappointing to me. I know ISFPs aren't emotionally dormant or anything, but do you think she'd ever completely open up to me? She seems like somebody who has the passion, but it never comes out when we're talking. Rather it presents itself more through the implications of her actions. Maybe I'm reading too far into her idk.
It was over text that she introduced me to this whole 16 personalities thing and she was really happy to see that I was an INFP as she predicted I'd be. Now I've sort of talked to others about isfp's and supposedly people say that they're incompatible with INFPs? Also are INFPs similar enough to INTJs that I might be the wrong one for her like her last boyfriend? Sorry for probably seeming so naiive, but I'm really new to this whole thing, and I guess what I really want to know, is based on my story/information, do think this INFP and ISFP couple could work together?"
2631,isfp,"I introduced this MBTI thing to my boyfriend when we were getting to know each other just to see if he'd be a good fit for me. ;) I was super unhappy he was an INFP as I'm an ISFP (and I've had trouble with them before)... but its the best relationship I've ever been in. As long as you are open to understanding and explaining things there are no issues.
Now.. I still don't get his mindset sometimes but its okay because hes awesome."
2632,isfp,"There's a lot more to a personal connection than MBTI. If you have chemistry, then why shouldn't it work? :)
My current SO is an ENFP. I would have never thought It could work out in the past. But our S/N contrast actually can really compliment each other at times. She helps me articulate some of the things I'm trying to express, while I help give her a more grounded and realistic point of view in certain situations.
It's all about being open and understanding! Good luck, Mate!"
2633,isfp,"Let's just say I tend to be like that without even trying. Kind of like you know how some individuals tend to not know that they offend people? Well my deal is me being passive aggressive without even trying.
I'm guessing that's like my defense mechanism to people I start to dislike? But when it comes to hate, I go 0 to 100 just like that. 
Can any of you relate?"
2634,isfp,"My passive aggressiveness is the root of my sense of humor along with being goofy. I'm not an asshole, I'm just tastefully sarcastic and I laugh at myself all the time. It makes me happy. If I'm in a odd mood I'll turn into the total opposite, a carefree mopey stoner that forgets things and accidentally offends people because I assume too much. Usually happens when I don't eat enough."
2635,isfp,"ISFP dislike? Then why are you even in this subreddit? Go back to your space INTP if you actually are a typist. Most of you guys aren't wanted here including yourself. There are a few INTPs that I've met in which I can talk to. 
""So I haven't hung out and socialized for 15 years?"" Doesn't surprise me since you like to roast on ISFPs on Reddit. "
2636,isfp,"Generally I tend not to finish games at all, and was wondering if any of you felt the same. I get very excited to buy a game and playing the beginning, yet never get to the end as I either get bored of it, just don't finish it when I mean to or take looong breaks (years). An example of this is Bioshock, as five years on from starting it I still haven't finished it and am only in Fort Frolic with photograph man, where I have been for the past two years.
However I have realised I tend to play a lot more games where there is no particular end, or they end quickly. I have over 1000 hours on both Team Fortress 2 and League of Legends. I have a lot of hours on games such as the Binding of Isaac and Terraria, where you can play for a while and stop whenever you want, only to pick it up again months later. I also tend to enjoy games such as Fallout and Skyrim, where I can dick about for as long as I want and start a new character immediately after dumping my old one. Anyone else experience this, or have similar experiences?"
2637,isfp,"I have only ever finished a few games, of the close to three hundred I own. Red Dead Redemption, Mount and Blade: Warband, and the first four Halo games. I tend to play sandbox games more than story driven games, so there's that. "
2638,isfp,It depends. I have over 1000 games and finished only a fraction of them. I don't know why but I just can't finish some of them. Not that I don't enjoy them I just stop playing them. Very few games have me sitting down every day to finish it all up. Mass Effect Trilogy was one of the few I played back to back until it was done.
2639,isfp,"It depends on the game.  If it's a platformer or RPG or some game that keeps me trying to improve my playing ability or character, or if it's short I'll beat it.  If the game just drags on and the environments or gameplay are too samey, I'll stop playing.  I've started lots of FPS games and quit halfway through for this reason but I finished all the Metroid Prime games because they were very engaging and fun."
2640,isfp,"Ha! This is so true of me. Even the best story games I've played, I still feel this slog in pushing through to the end. I think I hate the idea that all the work put into developing my character or whatever I'm playing with becomes irrelevant, so I tend to focus more on games that don't end. Guild Wars 2 (really any MMORPG...this is my MMORPG du jour), or PvP games with skill caps that I'll likely never reach, like league of legends, Starcraft 2. I like the idea that I can keep developing my skills for as long as I want, and I can still encounter unique challenges."
2641,isfp,"The problem with the huge sprawling games like Fallout 4 or Elder Scrolls is that the sidequests are often more fun and engaging than the main story.  Dark Brotherhood from Oblivion was super fun and interesting whereas the main storyline was a boring ""go here talk to person, maybe fight someone"" string of meh.  You're not even the main character in that game."
2642,isfp,"Ha, yeah, especially when you can't go back after I end up just viewing the main quest as sort of the last side quest. I will say for the half of it or so I've played I found the Fallout 4 main quest chain pretty good, barring the silliness at the end."
2643,isfp,"It is one of my all time favourite films. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful, touching and the soundtrack is no exception!
I bring this up because, what an ISFP thing to do! Or at least, what a me thing to do...?
(No spoilers) - a guy graduates a prestigious college. After attending, instead of following a more prestigious career, he donates ALL his money to charity, rids himself of all possessions and sets out on a journey alone through the Alaskan Wilderness. It‚Äôs also a true story - which just adds so much more meaning.
The entire movie is stunning, and again, truly touching. Be prepared to feel.. Seriously recommend it!
And also, what are your favourite movies? Songs even?"
2644,isfp,"Some of my fave movies:
The Wind that Shakes the Barley
Les Chansons D‚ÄôAmour
Pride and Prejudice (2005)
Trainspotting
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Empire Strikes Back
LOTR Trilogy
Linda Linda Linda
Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away)
House of the Flying Daggers
Chungking Express
In the Moood for Love
Anyone else like those? Are any of these especially ISFP-y? üòÖüòÖ"
2645,isfp,"Yes. This might sound pretty narcissistic but I think I‚Äôm an interesting person although I might not seem that way. I feel like I have many layers within myself and that I‚Äôm a deep, complex character. I like to analyze myself, why I am the way I am, why I act the way I acted, what ticks me, what motivates me etc probably due to my strong Fi. 
But then again I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone is complex and everyone has layers and they all have a story to tell. "
2646,isfp,"If I stepped outside of my shoes and observed myself, I would say that I'm boring, if I was not myself. But if I stepped outside of my shoes and observed myself while still being myself, I would still hangout with myself. Who wouldn't want to hangout with someone that is exactly like them? That's just too awesome. 
TLDR: I'm boring, but I would still hangout with myself if there was another me."
2647,isfp,"I think I‚Äôm probably more interesting than I give myself credit for. I often feel like I don‚Äôt really have a personality, just an obession with music and bad focus. Of course that doesn‚Äôt really make sense, but it doesn‚Äôt stop it from being how I come across to myself.
I‚Äôve tried writing this in a way that makes sense a few times, lol. It doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me either though. :P"
2648,isfp,"Yesterday I asked to my friends (in a game of awkward questions) who was the most emotional person of all of us, and they said me, that I'm a roller coaster of emotions.
So I guess that's the interesting part of me? They also said I'm so stressful I stress people around me.
I don't think I'm very interesting aside from my hobbies (drawing and gaming huh...)"
2649,isfp,"exactly i always felt like my essence was lacking something interesting and i seek things outside of myself to fill the hole for example i can hardly think of anything interesting to say about myself aside from things i do daily, i guess that solution is simple. do something but i‚Äôm lazy :P"
2650,isfp,"tbh yeah
usual comments about my personality are that i bring the life to the party
and im usually like errrrr okay yeah ""sure""
lol i think people just like fucking with us for some reason 
idk fucking lmao"
2651,isfp,"I've always been fairly introverted, which has baffled me because my siblings and my mother are very social and loud. Quite the opposite of me. I seem to have my mother's views and, most likely, my father's personality. Nowadays my anxiety and depression also exacerbate this behaviour of mine.
I've also asked my mother what kind of a child I was, and the only thing she's said is that ""If another kid, for example, were to grab a toy out of your hand, you'd just walk away and find something else to do instead of screaming your lungs out like someone else might.""
Looking back, I feel like I've always been pushed and pulled by other people, for better or for worse.
So I'd love to hear what kind of people y'all were as kids."
2652,isfp,"My mother is an ISFJ, my brother is an ESFJ and my father is ???? a screwed up, caustic INFJ with absurdly-developed Ti, maybe. From him I see a lot of what looks like inferior Se (Ni/Fe/Ti/Se).
In kindergarten I spent a lot of time exploring the schoolgrounds over socializing and making friends (note here that my elementary school was part of a larger complex which included a high school and associated facilities). I wasn't social at all, but when I did talk, I talked a lot. I remember being called a chatterbox at one point, which today would be the furthest thing from what I'm like. My dad once told me that until a certain point, I was a great kid who was always on his best behaviour in public."
2653,isfp,"I was always known for being really polite. This was, because I was too damn shy, and nice to do anything bad. I would always think of the repercussions of my future actions, and then imagining person react to my action always got me.  "
2654,isfp,"My mom is an ISFJ, dad is an ISTJ and brother is an IXFJ. 
As a kid I was the kid who did what she wanted but honestly never meant to make anyone angry or upset. I just remember doing things and saying things that nobody else understood or didn't like so I eventually learned to just not say much :P I would get really self-pitiful and punish myself a lot if I got in trouble or cause a dispute. 
I also hated pushing to the front of lines to get what I wanted. Naturally, my ISTJ dad would push me to push others but I just didn't understand. I was easy to give up because things didn't really bother me. 
I'm actually pretty sure I would have never learned to fend for myself if my dad hadn't pushed me. I despised it growing up but now it comes in handy at times. It's just not my natural state of being. "
2655,isfp,"Not really, they understand me for the most part, they just can't relate to everything about me. However for as much as I get along with my dad, we agree that if we were the same age or in school together, we probably wouldn't have liked each other much."
2656,isfp,"Alright, if we're ISFP's, we all enjoy working with media. Be it drawing, sculpting, writing music or using image editors. I propose we share stuff we're working on here, whether it be unfinished, or completed.

And so to get the ball rolling... I'm working on some music, could you tell me what you think of this so far?

2657,isfp,"How cool, I like it so far. What program do you use?
It has an  ISFP vibe where it's a bit matter-of-fact, has a sense of living in  the moment, and a bit of silliness. Are you planning on using it towards something? What inspires these tunes/sounds?"
2658,isfp,"Good call! Your song sounds great. The bassist I play with loves a line like that. I must show it to him, as we could definitely jam it out. :D Do I have to sign up to Noteflight to hear more?
Here's a soundcloud page with some random recordings. Enjoy! https://soundcloud.com/sound-trip "
2659,isfp,"The program I use is the site itself. All I did was sign up and the free version gives me space for 10 compositions, using the default instruments. I just recently decided I'm going to change this up a bunch into an original Pokemon theme for a game me and my friends are creating from scratch. Everything's going to be made by us.
To start though, I didn't really know where I was going with the song. Mainly I wanted to try writing something with some sort of fun baseline.
Other than that my main inspiration comes from Linkin Park, and then specifically for this song, I was thinking an ""Ain't No Rest for the Wicked"" vibe."
2660,isfp,"The thing about not looking at other possibilities and being blind to our futures is wildly inaccurate. And giving us praise isn‚Äôt going to make us love you. We are not blind to manipulation which is what I feel like this whole post is doing but disguising it as ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù.  It simplifies us, saying we‚Äôre easy to manipulate ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt social engineer an ISFP, you won‚Äôt be able to do it at all!‚Äù Like wtf? What happened to having genuine interactions with people"
2661,isfp,"Yeah, I had to get past my butthurtness of how easily manipulated this cat seems to think we are to the idea that maybe he's trying to find our common grounds so that we can get along.  And I think ""if you can't social engineer an isfp"" was more in relation to the commonalities / complementarity s/he perceives between our opposing functions.  So in that light, it's pretty interesting and s/he seems to have a decent handle on how our Ti and Te interact with our Fi but for the most part, I think s/he's got isfp pretty backward and I suspect the three s/he knows irl are mistyped isfjs.  What isfp ever greets by initiating a hug, lmao?  My biggest issue with entp in general is that they genuinely think we're fucking stupid (though they would never admit it, rather they'll talk their way around it because they do think we are that easily... engineered) and that they need to meet any non nt on some low pseudo emotional level and our own dislike of conflict will leave us silently seething after any such encounter.  That meme posted in here earlier is correct. /rant"
2662,isfp,Hi there. I'm just going to jump into it. I think my biggest problem is that I have a lot in my head but when I open my mouth it comes out as garbage. There were many situations where I would have the answers to something in my head but when I spoke it would just come out really poorly. Then the person just thinks I'm an idiot and assumes I don‚Äôt know anything because I obviously could not articulate it. I read that this is a common trait in isfps. Can you guys relate to this? How can I improve this?
2663,isfp,"I sometimes find it helpful to ask questions rather than trying to make statements, especially if I'm not 100% sure what my point is. 
Also...
It is a mistake to try to encapsulate an entire idea in a single statement and ISFPs tend to use as few words as possible. In a conversation I usually find it helpful to sort of latch on to a small part of what someone is saying and explore it more deeply by a) asking questions and b) making small statements."
2664,isfp,You could perhaps try writing a journal? Good practice for articulating your thoughts. Feel free to throw it out after if you're afraid anyone will read it. I usually just stay quiet until I've figured out exactly what I want to say. It took a long time and a few pissed off people to develop that habit 
2665,isfp,I always blurt out answers and stuff that are related but completely wrong. For example in first aid we were going through steps when finding an emergency. And for some reason I said call 911 even though the new zealand emergency number is 111. God I hated that
2666,isfp,"Give yourself time to think, remind yourself that you dont have to have the answer the same second as the question is asked. SInce I understood that, I have become so much better at articulating myself and not stress out all the time. Sometimes I might have to make the point several times, when it doesn't come out right I rephrase and try again. I mean, it's not the perfect solution but i feel like im getting better and as i practise i need fewer and fewer tries. "
2667,isfp,I am an INFP and my N function is very weak so I display some ISFP traits. I can relate to this. It made me be underestimated a lot during high school to the point where I didn't really have any friends I could talk to between classes. I want to learn how to articulate my thoughts without them turning into rubbish but I don't know how.
2668,isfp,"My desktop only has like 4 icons of games I never play bc Steam auto-added them. It's only clean bc I don't use my desktop, though; home directory and Documents are a shitstorm where some folders may be generic dumping zones while others may be nested down so far and precisely that there's only like 1 file per subfolder, and there's little logic or reason to which extreme of specificity any given directory may have."
2669,isfp,"I‚Äôll try to keep the explanation short, I‚Äôll have a TL;DR at the bottom anyway.
So, a couple weeks back I was in English class, when we had a mock exam. There was two options for this writing paper; description of a given picture, or a ‚Äústory where something unexpected happens‚Äù . I thought a bit, until I had this idea and wrote about two people on a them park ride gone awry. 
Anyway, I finished the paper but wasn‚Äôt massively happy with it. I thought it was decent, but nothing special. Fast forward to a couple weeks later, and my teacher absolutely loves it. Top marks. I‚Äôm not sure why, and honestly the compliments fell on deaf ears. Still, it was nice to hear. She read it out to the class as i sat there surprisingly uncomfortable. It was a nice gesture but god, I felt I was shrivelling up in my seat.
She finishes the story, I receive compliments and whatever. Mainly glad it‚Äôs over. But then she asks a question. She comes out with ‚Äúso, what was going through your head when you wrote this?‚Äù And I just froze. Not out of anxiety, but genuine confusion. What was going through my head? I sat for a few moments, saying nothing. She rephrases. ‚ÄúHonestly it‚Äôs fine, I just want to know your thought process?‚Äù And the best I could come out with was ‚Äúuh.. i just had an idea? I didn‚Äôt plan it‚Äù. 
I just thought it was an interesting thing. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? Just completely unable to provide an explanation for something, particularly something you made?
TL;DR: Wrote a short story. When asked by a teacher to explain how I created it, couldn‚Äôt find a genuine answer."
2670,isfp,"Yeah I can‚Äôt really explain it, it‚Äôs kinda best when nothing is going thru my head. I get into ‚Äúthe zone‚Äù and it‚Äôs all instinct. I‚Äôm an audio engineer so most of what I do is very abstract anyway and it‚Äôs more about a feeling than any analytical thought process
I know what you mean about compliments, my work is never good enough for me but often people are amazed by it"
2671,isfp,"I mean, it's very cool that you received such a response. and i want to read your thing now, too.  
do you read a lot? were you aware of using writing techniques learned in your lessons? i guess that's the sort of thing they might've been after.  
Anyway - nice one! hope you feel encouraged if it's something you enjoy doing."
2672,isfp,I always just have a very vivid idea and once I do it I can alter it and flesh it out however I want. Usually I just try to think of a style or feel I want and something fitting that description eventually comes to me
2673,isfp,"It's always striking to me to learn that a well loved piece of music/art/writing was looked upon as subpar by its creator (Maurice Ravel's Bolero, for instance).  It's at once encouraging, that beauty is indeed in the eye, or ear, of the beholder, and discouraging, that someone perceives such depth in something created under less than inspired circumstances.  Art is so weird.
Whatever goes through my head as I'm creating is unique to the piece, and I'm usually happy to give a somewhat superficial explanation of the process.  Sometimes the process is nobody's business.  Like I'm kind of surprised at your teacher's presumption that you'd be willing to share it in front of everyone."
2674,isfp,"I like that description, I suppose it does turn into a sort of instinct thing. ‚ÄúThe zone‚Äù is also an interesting way of putting it. I feel I notice I was in that ‚Äúzone‚Äù more once I‚Äôve come out of it, and have very vague recollection of anything that went through my mind during it other than the idea. I also love how other things get pushed down the priority list during it, as it takes precedence.
But that job sounds very interesting! Good luck with it! :)"
2675,isfp,"Appreciate it! Sadly I don‚Äôt have it on me, I have her class tomorrow - I‚Äôll see if I can pick it up. But no, I don‚Äôt read. I‚Äôve tried, it just can‚Äôt seem to catch my attention. I struggle to focus and picture what I‚Äôm reading. Perhaps I just haven‚Äôt found the right book yet. As for techniques, I definitely wasn‚Äôt aware of using any. The good thing about creative writing is it allows you to be far more personal and, well, creative. As opposed to the other rigid, linear exams. But thankyou very much!"
2676,isfp,"Wow, I suppose that is a very interesting point. Never thought of it in that sense. I agree with what you mean about superficial explanation. I could give one if I needed, but it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be a true/full one. And it took me by surprise also, it‚Äôs pretty out of character for her. Not a question I‚Äôd be up for being asked again in such a situation."
2677,isfp,"Sounds like you have a knack for expression. 'The good thing about creative writing is it allows you to be far more personal and, well, creative.' - yeah. if you're relaxed you're free. it's just sweet that other people dig your stuff, too. this explanation would frustrate your teach, though, if they're trying to understand/replicate the secret sauce.
maybe aphantasia (or add - executive function thing). the ~~post-~~modernists help me. It's less description, and more stream of consciousness/sensory and poetic. Virginia Woolf's The Waves. James Joyce - have read ""artist as a young man"", just started Ulysses, and it's crazy - it feels like some pulpy thing. it has atmosphere. even though it has the descriptive stuff that often makes me tune out.  
But you also might hate that stuff.  
Oh, and the more psychy stream of consciousness that's less poetic, like Crime and Punishment. i thought that book was gonna be scary-intellectual, but really it's a disquieting, juicy psychological thriller.  
sorry. this is long. i'm procrastinating. have a good one."
2678,isfp,"Thankyou very much! It‚Äôs nice to hear that :) I definitely agree, relaxed work is free work, and free work is good work. And it may frustrate her but she‚Äôs usually more open to the whole freedom based way of doing things - it was quite an out of character thing to ask. Perhaps she was just attempting to reinforce the ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù as you put it.
Also, I really appreciate the recommendations! I would love to find joy through reading. They sound like great ideas, I‚Äôll be sure to look into them. Have a good day/night or whatever!"
2679,isfp,"My fellow ISFPers. It's time we have a discussion about something...
If there's any of the 16 personalities to be effected by a psychadelic experience, it's us. We're already overwhelmed with the everyday physical stimulus of our environment, but on LSD or shrooms, it's significantly amplified.
I'm not one to force anything onto others, but if you have not tried a psychadelic drug atleast once in your ilfetime, you may be missing out on one of the most fascinating, eye-opening, challenging, euphoric, meaningful experiences of your life.  
Please post your experiences with psychadelics below!!"
2680,isfp,I did Salvia many times in college.  I saw things that were other worldly.  Everything would swirl together and it would be tunnel of colors and shapes and I would hear crazy intense chime sounds that were super soothing.  Most notably was everytime I felt totally out of my body.  As the trip would start I would feel myself floating higher and higher above my body to the point where I could look down and legit see myself.  It was easily the craziest thing I have ever experienced.
2681,isfp,"My experience is pretty limited, but I'm highly intrigued by psychedelics and hope to have the chance to experiment further in my time. This article about personality types and psychedelics was pretty interesting to me (although I don't suggest anyone should jump right into trying DMT based off an Internet article)"
2682,isfp,"I've done Shrooms a few times, once a heroic dose that was the biggest mind fuck ever! The friends I did it with had crazy experiences of space and time not being the same, but I had the craziest visuals and at the peak of the high i no longer felt human or limited to physical form and didn't ever want to come back to this limited physical existence (that's how I was thinking while tripping). Space and time didn't even exist to me.
As a result, coming down was really hard for me, more than my friends. I plan to do them again in the future, but for anyone looking at doing something like shrooms or lsd, my advice would be to start with a lower dose and work up from there rather than jump into the deep end from the start. Happy tripping!"
2683,isfp,"I'm very experienced with psychedelics and I'm an ISFP.
Visuals are incredible. Everything I appreciate about aesthetics in the world just pops out and glows and vibes together. Music definitely shapes your headspace. Also helps sort my weird and twisty brain into words that make sense, so I can really look at my problems and decide on how to solve them. :)"
2684,isfp,"I don't have experience with either but from what I've heard, I have no intentions of trying salvia and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. DMT is a beast of its own as it's supposed to be the strongest but I would think probably the most rewarding for someone who could handle it. 
I think LSD would be the best bet to answer your question. "
2685,isfp,"Thanks - that is the problem with psychedelics - I want to try some, but since everyone's body is different, you don't know how you will react...and I am an older person, 56, so I am not sure the experience would be worth the risk...probably eating a good pot brownie would be a good place to start!! LOL"
2686,isfp,"You‚Äôre  just too distant for my arms. Maybe you‚Äôre too far for my hugs. Could my imagination be as long to reach you somewhere and taste you? I don‚Äôt know what I really feel. I wonder what you think about me, if you're cold enough.
‚Äã
I  wake up at night and cry fucked up. I'm still afraid of the dark. Gosh i‚Äôd do anything to have some of your sweetness now. but I'm very scared that  something grabs me from under the bed if I put one foot on the floor.  why you far flan?"
2687,isfp,I like hugging because it makes me feel comforted. Like holding my stuffed animal or dog while I'm contemplating life. Or anything else that can help ease my feelings for a bit. I don't want to pry. I just wanted to say I kind of understand what you're feeling and hoping you'll get better somehow in your own way. =)
2688,isfp,"Giving random hugs and kisses, being told I am loved, being close to each other, feeling his skin next to mine... Big romantic gestures, while touching, have a tendency to overwhelm me. I love sweet little nothings!
While I don't like flashy, expensive gifts, the big romantic gestures that I really appreciate are those that involve being offered something that they personally made. Like a home-cooked meal or DIY furniture. They're gifts I'll forever treasure."
2689,isfp,"I WOULD LOVE TO BE HUGGED A FUCKING LOT.
‚Äã
but being useful for you, I have to say that there are very different isfps. different enneagrams, age, instinctual variants, are you male or female? is the isfp you talk a male or a female? how old are you two?
‚Äã
As a good recommendation, I'd say do something together. something that is good for both of you and that you find interesting, such as studying together if you're in classes, or doing something that leaves you something more than a simple experience. such as for example, a cake. so try cooking with him if you want. 
‚Äã
and now, going back to what I said, I'D LOVE TO VE HUGGED A FUCKING LOT.  But I'm male and I don't know how the females will take it."
2690,isfp,"Hi. Inspired by this post by an animal caretaker person, I thought I'd share a couple of quick observations from some of the jobs I've stumbled into. If anyone wants to share their own experiences, or comment on mine, then please feel free.  
Bartending
I always felt out of place. It was a masquerade‚Äîbut the time flew by when it was busy, so the money felt easy.
But not being myself took the spring out of my step.  
Cook (short-order, small kitchen)
 Kitchens are a bit of a refuge for outcasts and weirdos, so it was fun letting loose.
 A lot of jobs I've had play-down anything involving the senses, but a kitchen expects and rewards a critical eye, nose, ear, tongue.
Manipulating the colours and forms when plating up was great fun - especially desserts.
 I enjoyed working in a small team, getting to know a few people well. Supporting each other. The camaraderie, and also the in-jokes, and silliness. I never thought I'd consider myself a 'team player', but I guess I became one without realising.
 That said‚Äîit was stressful, taxing on the working memory (I wanted to test my limits, but I never got the hang of it), and the 12-hour shifts felt like a sentence.
And then there was the radio. The fucking radio.
It's an easy job to get into, and I'm glad I did it. Give it a go if you have any interest.  
Gardener
I had a cushy job looking after a few gardens for the local council. 
 I loved looking after the flowers, the immersion in colour. You do a job and immediately see the difference you've made.
 Being a part of nature, the seasons being relevant, etc. I would be up for the orange glow of sunrise, and put the sprinklers out with the twilight. It was all very manicured‚Äîbut with all the smells and birdsong and whatnot, I became aware I was on the revolving earth.
* I didn't do it for anyone else, but people would often come up and share their gratitude/appreciation. Plant people are lovely. (I'd inadvertently surrounded myself with relaxed, happy people).  

I'll finish on a sour-ish note: I don't know if it's to do with type, or if it's me, but I've never felt like I belonged in any job I've had. Like, this is something I'm doing until I figure out how I want to spend the majority of my energy. I'm just standing-in until someone better suited comes along. I'm in the waiting room.  
When do you/don't you feel like an impostor?  
Still, I'm attracted to jobs where I have a small role with greater implications. A masseuse relieving a worker's pains so they can play with their children. A beekeeper spreading wildflower. A woodsman creating habitats, birdsong, clean air. A luthier creating instruments for beautiful music."
2691,isfp,"Okay, I'll bite.
Ice skating teacher: I enjoyed working with the little kids, and playing games with them. I found being watched by their parents a little nervewracking though.
Cashier: Boring, but fine. Not really much to say here.
Server: I was completely terrible at this. I forgot things all the time. I think I'm just a bad multitasker.
PCA (Old Folks' Home Worker): I was also terrible at this. I hated that I never had enough time to properly tend to anyone, let alone make a connection with them. I think the idea of working in health care is appealing to me, but the current understaffed/overworked system is just too stressful
Tree planter: This was sweet. I liked being outside, and being alone with my thoughts. I got paid per tree so nobody (other than me) really cared how hard I worked. The amount of progress I could see each day was also sweet.
Ski Hill Lift Operator: This was a great job. I got paid to ski, and spent the whole day outside. It was just too little pay in too expensive of a ski town to do long term.
Ski Patroller: I still got paid to ski, but now I had more responsibility. Overall I enjoyed it, but I struggled with being overly critical of how I handled patients. I tended to go over how I could've been better after each patient.
Construction worker: Another outdoors job, which I liked. Again, I liked seeing the progress as we built things. My main dislike was the amount of overtime/weekend work that made it really difficult to maintain work/life balance.
Researcher/computer programmer: This was an interesting job. Mostly it was incredibly frustrating, but it was also super exciting when my code actually worked.
Engineer: This is what I do now. It is okay. I still am involved in a lot of construction projects which are fun to watch get built. I also get to work a lot with landscape architects because I do a lot of city pathways, ponds, rivers, etc. so I get to make things pretty. I stick with it because I like the slow pace of work (I'm rarely rushed), rarely/never working evenings or weekends, getting like 6 weeks of vacation a year, being able to work from home when I want, and having enough money to pursue all of my hobbies.
If I had to start over, I think top choices for me would be a gardener, carpenter, or landscape architect. However, I think I'm pretty satisfied with an imperfect job that gives me the freedom to do exactly what I want in my free time."
2692,isfp,"Hotel housekeeping: a little gross. Well, a LOT gross. Hard work. But full days of taking care of details and not talking to anybody. Days went by fast. 
Vet assistant: literally held dogs for a living. Also cleaned up a lot of blood and poop.  Very hard work and 14 hour days for little pay. But still a lot of fun - again, taking care of details, not having to talk much and time flew. 
Videographer assistant: nooope. Cool experience but I am not assertive enough to boss people around. 
Data entry: oh god kill me. This job involved a lot of eating to keep myself sane. Also one of those jobs where you stay for 8 hours and have to look busy even if there‚Äôs nothing to do. 
Truck dispatching: yeah I‚Äôm not organized or assertive enough for this one. I was good at finding solutions for weird stuff that came up but didn‚Äôt love being screamed at every time I answered the phone. 
Web-based customer service: this is my current role. It‚Äôs okay. I get to email instead of phoning most of the time, so that‚Äôs nice. I work with an even number of I and E, but still find everyone is too into small talk.  I have a lot of pressure-prompted tasks sometimes and that‚Äôs nice. I also have days where the only thing on my plate is data management or emails to touch base with clients. Those days are less nice. They provide us with cookies. "
2693,isfp,"YESSSS!!!
I've worked as a bartender... was fun to start with, but I found my snarky, sarcastic, un-empathetic side started creeping out and I felt like I was losing myself. That on top of the late hours and shitty other staff who were there to socialise than get any work done. 
Worked as a zoo attendant, because I like animals... even so much as going to uni for 3 years to study zoology (only to quit), then trying my hand at a TAFE degree (trade degree) in animal studies... only to lose interest in that and quit also. But I was going through a tough time mentally as well so that may be in part due to the fact of losing interest, and being unmotivated. 
Now studying another TAFE degree in travel... haven't wanted to quit and I'm almost finished... but if I'm honest I don't think its what I'd really want to do. Actually I've never known what I want to do, and its been a HUGE stressor on my life. I hate the thought of working a 9-5, I don't believe in full time work. Which coming from a family of extremely hard workers is concerning, and so I have never expressed this to any of them. And people look at me and think I'm crazy. But I feel as long as I'm happy and healthy I don't care what I'm doing. 
I'm also a photographer, have had a number of small paid event photographing jobs, but its more of just a hobby for me, I don't think there's any point in pursuing a career in the field because everyone's a Damn photographer these days so it'd be very competitive. So I'm happy just doing once off events every so often. 
Once upon a time I enjoyed learning and going to school, but since going to uni and feeling like I suck at it I loathe the idea of returning. But if I did I think I'd hope to go into a teaching position as well as a careers advisor ... very ironic I know, but I figure if I can't help myself I might as well help others... And I'm fucking fantastic at doing that hahaha. 
TL:DR - worked as a receptionist, bartender, zookeeper, freelance photographer, pet sitter, nothing sticks. And studied 3 degrees, 2 of which I've quit, the 3rd I've almost finished but I don't think its what I want to do... "
2694,isfp,"Huh... Maybe I ought to give gardening another try. Last year I worked with my ISTP Dad for his gardening business and it was a lot more stressful, tiring and busy than the experiences you and OP described. 
It was a full time job from Monday to Friday plus Saturday mornings. It involved a bit of everything from weeding to chopping palm tree pods to replacing three cubic meters of pine mulch. Every day I'd look forward to my lunch break because other than that there's no time for rest. My dad would jam as many projects in a day as possible and while he was flexible if we didn't get everything done in the time he allotted, he would still get very irritated if it wasn't his own fault.
That said, I did enjoy mowing lawns because I didn't have to think very hard about what I was doing and the noise it made drowned out my voice to the people around me so I could sing and talk to myself out loud without worrying about bothering anyone."
2695,isfp,"Thank you for sharing your experiences, kazz.
I always wanted to try Tree Planting - from what I've gleaned from media, it seems (seemed) to attract hard-working hippies. I liked the idea of going from a solitary job, then relaxing in a communal environment.
I've also thought of doing something like PCA. Maybe there's a type of specialist nursing which doesn't have the problems you've mentioned. When I've had to visit the minor injuries unit of the local hosp, I'm seen by a Nurse Practitioner (almost, but not quite, a physician). Using advanced knowledge in a relaxed environment to treat generally non-life-threatening problems.  
What are your reservations about your current job (if you're happy to divulge)? I imagine it's to do with organisation/red tape, or the potential deskiness of it, but I thought it better to just ask.
Do you think you have/will acquire the skills to set up a side venture, or consulting/similar. I don't know much about engineering, so my questions might be unrealistic."
2696,isfp,"The kitchen was the first job where I realised work could be fun/play, 
and not just doldrum and flagellation. 
The guys I worked with were great at their job and very calm in a crisis. I think respect for the people around you plays a big part in being motivated for the right reasons (and begets loyalty, willingness to face the day).  
I love my garden, but I'm glad it's low maintenance xD.
Would love to look after a woodland, though."
2697,isfp,"Not a lot! I was on agency, and was put in charge because I'd been there the previous year; knew all the plants and how to care for them.  
I think the 'skilled gardeners' made between ¬£24-28k, and about half of them had side gigs (probably not taxed). These are usually former temp agency people, so that's perhaps more than they ever expected to make. It's good pay for the location (not a major city). 
That's working for the council, though. I'm sure a competitive person working privately could make as much as they wanted (but depending on the work, it can have a seasonal unbalance)."
2698,isfp,"I might have left out some nitty gritty details for the sake of brevity.
Certainly almost all the permanent staff had chronic back/knee issues. I wished I'd gone into it with better mobility, and broken up the time spent strimming steep banks. I always went home sweaty, bleeding, and often too tired for hobbies.  
The work culture will be different in different places/organisations. Local council, small landscaping business, private garden/estate, botanical garden, nursery‚Äîit's all going to be different. Your experience with your Dad would put you in good stead, though. Or even if you decide to do something else, grass cutting/hedge trimming can be a good side gig, and pays better than the gym.  
I get what you're saying about mowing. That relaxed concentration/zoning out. Strimming is sort of similar. Unless you're worried about flicking up a stone and cyclopsing some poor kid looking up at your visored face."
2699,isfp,"Honestly, almost every time I see an IxFP in fiction I end up being unsure if they're INFP or ISFP, so I discuss with others, and most of the time they bring up some very convincing arguments for INFP. Online sites usually type most IxFP characters as INFP, as well.
I mean, sure they can be wrong, but it does give me the impression that INFPs are way more common."
2700,isfp,"It's probably because INFPs tend to be writers and will do the self-insert stuff because they love talking about their own feelings and struggles with other people.
On the flip side, don't see nearly as many big INFP musicians as ISFPs musicians."
2701,isfp,"I don't mean to sound contrary by saying this, but I tend to be wary of ever typing fictional characters due to the fact that they're fictional and lack a real individual psychology. It can be fun to think this way especially if we're emotionally invested in the story, but it tends to muddy the waters of how we approach it IRL. That being said, they probably are over represented, it may have something to do with many INFPs being successful authors. Most INFPs I have met IRL don't match up to their portrayals in fiction and other media however."
2702,isfp,"Idk if this is related to what you said, but I have noticed I‚Äôm terrible at spotting other ISFPs. I don‚Äôt know why; you‚Äôd think it‚Äôs easy to spot someone like you but it really isn‚Äôt. So maybe that‚Äôs why it seems like there‚Äôs so few of us. I‚Äôve heard ISFPs are difficult to spot in general so who knows."
2703,isfp,"I won‚Äôt go into a lot of detail because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary, but there‚Äôs been this person that hasn‚Äôt been the kindest to me (I‚Äôm a senior btw). He was extremely rude to me and basically made fun of me really passive aggressively in front of the whole class. I really wanted to say something to him after because he‚Äôs supposed to be my friend (long story) but I became so anxious that I just couldn‚Äôt. I keep telling myself that I shouldn‚Äôt create an issue and that maybe it‚Äôs actually somehow me who‚Äôs in the wrong. I know ISFPs generally hate conflict, so do you guys have any advice?
I didn‚Äôt put a lot of detail for brevity‚Äôs sake, but I‚Äôm happy to answer any clarifying questions."
2704,isfp,"my weapon of choice would be joking :) while feigning hurt, i would say something along the lines of, ""Really? You had to say that in front of the whole class? How you gonna do me like that man? That was mean...I thought we were friends :'("" 
this is my go-to method for minor gripes.
though ISFPs are conflict-averse, they can be direct about things that matter to them. personally i'm not afraid of firm call-outs or straight up confronting someone if it's something i really feel strongly about. 
a firmer approach would be to say kindly but firmly, ""You humiliated me in front of the whole class and I really don't think that's okay, regardless of what your intentions were."" best case, he actually didn't know any better and genuinely feels sorry and stops being so rude to you. 
if he continues to be rude to you then it's time to consider marie kondoing him out of your life because ain't nobody got time for that :)"
2705,isfp,"Laugh along as if you're going with it and then say loudly ""wow SOMEONE'S jealous"" in an exaggerated way while looking at him and smirking. Anything he says just clap back, talk over him, interrupt him, anything. Practice in the mirror if you have to. And keep the crowd on your side. Everyone knows he's being an asshole but you gotta call it. "
2706,isfp,"It gave me a sort of map of my natural weaknesses/things I tend to struggle with. I see it as a tool or cheat sheet for personal development. I'm an INFP, and one thing it taught me is that I tend to read way too much into other people's actions/words. Rather than ask someone a specific question to find out what they think/how they feel, I assume I already know. This can be a huge challenge in relationships. I've been practicing asking specific questions/giving people a chance to show me who they are. I consider what my intuition tells me, but I try not to let it rule my decisions/judgements. My closest relationships have already improved and I'm grateful! This is just one example."

2708,isfp,"Cats. Rabbits and foxes, too. 
We had a thing in one of our psychology classes where we had to write down an animal that came first into our minds, then second and third. The first animal was your ""ideal self"". The second one was how others see you. The third was how you actually are. 
So, my first animal was a cat (my ideal self), my second was a fox (how others see me) and the third was a rabbit (who i actually am). It was a fun test thingy, although I also thought it was kinda accurate haha"
2709,isfp,"(ENFP) I think most ISFPs identify with cats, interestingly enough. I don't think I think of myself in animal terms at all although a friend of mine called me a jaguar once because in social settings, I often just sit and observe..."

About a week ago, I met this girl busking (also another musician/ busker), who I am assuming to make things simpler is an ISFP.
She's very artsy, literally lives and breathes art, music, photography, film, etc. Anyway I struck up a conversation with her as I was curious as to where I was able to busk in that particular area. Initially I had no other intentions except to learn more about the ins and outs of busking in that area from a fellow busker, who seemed very friendly and approachable. 
Anyway I introduced myself, said I was a busker, she shook my hand and introduced herself, was very smiley and friendly (just her peaceful nature I suppose). I made sure it was okay if I busked further down, and she said it was and was grateful I asked. I went off and busked a bit further down. 
 As she passed me when she had packed up, she smiled, and mouthed that I was very good, and dropped in a dollar. Also as she turned the corner on the street, I saw her look at me for a bit longer and smile-- perhaps just her sort of wowed by me singing (not to be arrogant, but don't want to assume this is a sign of attraction). 
That night, I found her on Facebook, as I wanted to check out her music (she was busking on a hand pan, but is also a singer/ multi instrumentalist) I was also intrigued by her, hard to explain. I messaged her, saying it was nice to meet her. 
We struck up a conversation for a while, she said she thought I sounded so good, and she loved my voice.
We chatted about music for a while, the conversation flowed pretty well, and she kept asking me questions about me and my music. When she found out I was queer (well not straight) she seemed chuffed with herself cause apparently she'd picked up almost instantly that I was into girls haha. I asked why, and she said perhaps from my style (which she also said she loved) but also a vibe. 
 We continued to chat, she kept complimenting me and being what I would say friendly, perhaps borderline flirtatious, although i am god awful at picking up on those things, hence why I'm enquiring on this forum. We talked about our sexuality (we both feel we're more attracted to the person than gender), she asked me what my type was aha. We chatted about relationships, etc. 
I was in a relationship (undefined) at the time, however the girl was slowly detracting her affection and I knew it, was just coming to terms with the fact it was gonna end (I have now broken it off). 
We talked for a good few hours, she continued to keep the convo going, asking me questions about myself. Also her answers seemed quite thoughtful (typical of ISFP). We just seemed to click, like it seemed effortless chatting with her. We had some good laughs at stupid things (she has a rad sense of humour it turns out, very witty and sarcastic). 
.... 
We chatted the next night, into the morning, and we were in fits of laughter. I somehow had the idea of making a carrot into a clarinet/ flute, and she strongly encouraged this insane plan of mine, and she kept joking with me. She pushed me (teasingly) into sending her a video of me playing on this carrot instrument, and apparently it ""made her night""
We talked intermittently after that, we were both super busy with social events and music related activities. She continued to be quite fun and jokey (can't think of a better word) with me. I was  actually shocked at her blatant wit and her overt sarcasm. She also said to make sure I came and said hi if I was busking in the same spot as her any time. But again could just be her being friendly.
We stopped contacting each other as often over the past few days, because I was going through a tough time after ending things with this other girl, and she was super busy with gigs, and recording.  But we have had small chats here and there.
Do you think there is a possibility she could be interested? Or do you see this as purely her being friendly? She seems to respect me at least, and find me inspiring and interesting as an artist which is nice. But how do you differentiate the friendly from the more-than-friendly with ISFP's? You guys are a very mysterious and secretive bunch, it seems.
I wouldn't say I have a crush on her, but I am definitely fascinated by her- she's just so mystical, and there is something very intriguing and beautiful about her. She has this quiet confidence, like she knows who she is but doesn't feel the need to shout it, and is just comfortable with who she is. 
I know it was super long, thanks for your time!!! "
2711,isfp,"Busking! I learned a new word today, thank you. :) You said it so many times that I just had to look it up lol Anyway, it sounds like she likes you, but you're probably gonna have to take lead if you want things to move forward, relationship wise. Things might have gotten a bit stagnate for her in your friendship, and thus the subtle, yet noticeable dwindling of contact. I would also say that the fact that she opened up about her sexuality with you at all, is probably a good indication that she's interested. Ask her to coffee, or a nice park or something and really try to get to know her :) Worst case scenario, you guys stop talking - which is kinda where you're heading right now anyway, or you might just end up with a really cool friend! Good luck, and please keep me updated! :) "
2712,isfp,"Thanksss. This is so helpful, and good to hear (or read?). 
Seeing as we're both musicians, I asked her tonight if she wanted to collab some time (hehe) and she replied pretty swiftly saying she's flat out but we could definitely busk together! Seems promising. 
Also i know she is legitimately busy, she's a musician, photographer and film maker so she is flat out haha. "
2713,isfp,"Thanks dude! Hmm yeah that is possible, she seems super friendly with everyone! Yeah, will take a lot of courage, don't know if I'd be able to do it in person. 
If say next time I saw her, I was quite overtly flirty, do you think that would be a good idea? To gauge her reaction? Or do you get scared off by that? Haha I am clueless lol."
2714,isfp,"Pretty sure OP is not opposed to being friends first. But ya know when you really hit it off with someone, and you start feeling like you want to be ""more than friends"" with them...I think that's what she meant. She didn't say I want to bang this girl and never talk to her again...of course she wants to be friends first, that's how you establish any meaningful relationship. In fact, (reading her post) they are friends and talk via text a lot until recently. That's friendship, isn't it? I dunno. "
2715,isfp,"I've taken quite a few MBTI tests online and I always end up 50/50. Here are some details about me: 


I struggle with making close friends; I don't want to open up to people because I'm afraid that they may not be worth the effort


I build rapport quickly but I am also socially awkward to some extent


One of my acquaintances told me that I seem emotionally closed-off and not bubbly, especially for someone in my line of work (I'm a receptionist). 


I'm uncomfortable in a leadership role. I don't like being bossed around, so I avoid imposing myself on others


I'd like to think that I have strong aesthetics. I receive a lot of compliments on my style choices


Here's a conundrum: I love going to events involving loud music, dancing, and autosports. However, I would just wander around and do my own thing instead of socializing with strangers. I just don't feel the incentive to do so. 


Hobbies: gaming, ATVing (I love taking physical risks and anything with speed/power), hiking, browsing the web


long-term planning is my archnemesis 


Thanks in advance for the insight!"
2716,isfp,"What you described above doesn't massively pertain to being either introverted or extroverted. An introvert can easily enjoy busy events and an extrovert can be happy enough alone. 
When you're around people and socialising do you come away feeling rejuvenated and energised, or do you feel like you want time alone to decompress and refuel. "
2717,isfp,"You sound a bit like me. I‚Äôm quite certain I am an ISFP. I like to socialize at times but I also do a lot on my own and it takes a while for me to connect and trust people and consider them friends and not just acquaintances or people I hang out with sometimes. 
I‚Äôm also pretty big into the fun and exhilarating activities. I‚Äôve never really been into team sports though; I worry about disappointing people."
2718,isfp,It depends on the kind of people I'm with. If I'm with a close friend or two then I could spend a very long time interacting with them; this is refreshing for me. If I'm with strangers from a party or something then yes I definitely need time alone 
2719,isfp,"Team sports are a hard NO for me. I'm not naturally competitive. 
I guess I'm a little bit more on the introverted end, now that I'm reading your response. I want really good, memorable interactions as opposed to superficial conversations.  "
2720,isfp,"I too can spend a long time in the company of very close friends in small numbers or an SO. I think of that as an inner circle, where being with these people doesn't drain me because more often than not they are introverts too and we may happily sit in silence or I can fully be 'myself'. FWIW I am an 'outgoing' introvert, and people rarely think I'm introverted until I tell them, and I lean massively towards I, about 70%, maybe this is what you are too. I think because of your last sentence that you are an introvert. Have you read the intro pages on 16 personalities for the two types to see what suits more? I would think there's a decent difference between 'The Entertainer' (E) and 'The Artist' (I)"
2721,isfp,"I can certainly relate to being a more balanced-out introvert. I always have something to say, but I can struggle with finding the right words; end up saying nothing at all. 
I've read through a good number of websites, but I don't find myself leaning heavily towards one end of the spectrum or the other"
2722,isfp,"Do you find ISFPs have difficulty apologizing for something they did wrong? 
As an ISFP I often have that difficulty, but not because I think I never do anything wrong or that I'm not sorry for doing something wrong, but because I'm so in the moment that I have a hard time putting myself in the mindset of when I committed the fault in question. And this matters because I am also oriented towards authenticity and if I'm not in that mindset I can't feel the wrong I did to apologize and authentically mean it. 
However if the wrongdoing is caught right away when I'm still in the mindset that was behind the wrongdoing, I can fairly easily apologize.   
‚Äã
Does that make sense?"
2723,isfp,"I have an easy time apologizing, if I have a hard time recollecting to the moment I usually apologize for even acting in a way I don't remember myself doing. That's just me though, I grew up with a lot of brothers so I'm used to getting into fights and being cool the next hour"
2724,isfp,"I apologize very easily, even for things I probably shouldn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt need to apologize for. partially to avoid conflict, partially because I think it‚Äôs overrated to win an argument/ have the last word, and partially out of habit"
2725,isfp,"I‚Äôm ISFP with difficulty apologizing 
For me it‚Äôs pride probably, don‚Äôt want to feel the shame of being wrong. Acknowledging faults is difficult. I‚Äôm also annoyed by people who apologize to much. I think it‚Äôs the live & let live. I feel like, if your intent wasn‚Äôt to hurt me, then no harm done."
2726,isfp,"I have a very easy time analysing past mindsets and reflecting on them, which makes apologising come very easily for me. 
What's more authentic  than accepting responsibility? I feel it's more authentic if you aren't in the mindset that you were in when you did it, because you can reflect with hindsight and analyse the situation from a new perspective. When I apologise in the moment, I'm the same person I was when I did it, and it's harder for me to see why I'm in the wrong. I'll still apologise for anything and everything, though."
2727,isfp,"Yeah, I kinda get what you are saying. But it is a bit hard when it is abstract. I need to think of specific examples. I think for me when it is an acquaintance or even with some friends, it is pretty easy to apologize; I go out of my way to accommodate them even if it can be inaccurate. But with a close significant other I really don't want to misrepresent my true self."
2728,isfp,"So you mean ISFP vs. INTP?
e.g., https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/6m6d4o/differences_between_istp_and_isfp/
‚Äã
I definitely feel like an Fi, in that I have this internal world of feelings that is not at all systematic."
2729,isfp,"Give each other some space, make time for your friends and activities that you enjoy outside the relationship. 
Be respectful of each others opinion and ideas because you may not always be on equal terms about everything. 
Be comfortable being who you are in the relationship because that will make you both happy. 
If you feel something is making you feel a certain way, be calm, open and honest with each other and find some time to discuss it. 
Also, to get what you want in the relationship, you should learn to give it first. Give more of what you want to receive. If you want him/her to understand you, you have to start by understanding them. If you want them to respect you, you have to start by respecting them. If you want them to show you more love, you should show and give them love. This can benefit in any sort of relationship really. "
2730,isfp,"This is really well said. Thank you stranger. How are you unafraid of giving lots of love and not worry about being hurt? Is this an ISFP thing or is this just you? 
My ISFP bf is such an open person (with his emotions and wants/needs), it constantly amazes me. I have to actively work on being open like that. "
2731,isfp,"Thank you for the wonderful comment! =) 
I like to help others and guide them to better understand themselves so they won't feel lost or alone if I can. I'm not sure if every ISFP person feels the same way, but I strongly do. Sometimes I'm willing and not afraid of voicing my thoughts or opinions because I know deep down inside that the person who is seeking for help is doing it for a healthy reason. I want to give them some light to that darkness. I know that I give more than I deserve, but what can I do. That's who I am as a person and I don't regret any of it. I'm content with that feeling. 
I'm glad that you can see and understand the good that he's shown you. I like that you are steadily learning to develop that quality because it tells me that you care about him and wanting to develop a good and comforting relationship. I'm sure it would mean a lot to him and would benefit you both in the long run. =)"
2732,isfp,is anyone else really literal with communication and sometimes find it hard to pick up on jokes. I'm wondering if this is an ISFP thing. Like when you are at a store and ask if somethings available or if they can help with something and they say no but are joking. Also my uncle told me my family abusing me is all my fault and I couldn't tell if he was joking or not.
2733,isfp,"I'm the exact same way. And one of my recent gfs commented on this without me mentioning it. She said that I say everything literally, and expect to be told things literally too. Like I'm not really subtle at all. I pretty much spell things out and communicate to people very straight forwardly leaving out no important detail.
I'm very much an ISFP, but I'm also ADHD-pi. I've heard many ISFP also tend to be ADHD. Because I'm ADHD and can sometimes have a hard time learning complicated directions, I tend to be pretty detailed, and literal, so that people can understand me well. I get annoyed when someone gives directions and they're extremely vague, or leave out important details. So I think this could be both an ISFP thing and an ADHD thing."
2734,isfp,"It's not a me thing. I'm definitely not great at making jokes myself, but I can recognize them easily. I don't think any function is related to detecting sarcasm. Thats just a social skill you may not have developed completely."
2735,isfp,This sounds more like some form of Aspergers or Autism. You may want to talk to a councilor or psychologist. Your Uncle sounds like an ass and I would seek a councilor just for the fact that you have experienced abuse. If you are still being abused please tell a professional and take the necessary steeps to get out of that terrible situation. 
2736,isfp,I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just speculating based on your description. I'm not sure what you are like outside of what you described and even if you were diagnosed as having something it wouldn't change who you are as a person. They are just labels used to help yourself and others understand how best to make you feel better.  I wish you the best and I hope you are able to get out of your abusive situation.  
2737,isfp,"Usually younger people are easier to talk to. I‚Äôm pretty young myself (about to turn 18) but I have a much easier time talking to kids, or even underclassmen. I‚Äôm always kind of the ‚Äòmom friend‚Äô though so I think it‚Äôs mostly because I tend to take care of others, so younger people are easier in that sense. Older people tend to be at completely different stages of life, and tend to bombard me with what they think I should do with my life or unwanted advice etc etc. I do get along with older people, but I tend to prefer younger people."
2738,isfp,older. anyone below 18 and i feel like i've got to semi-parent them or whatever people do that keeps them entertained and from doing something stupid. i also have to make the effort not to curse as much as i do. i am 24 now but i've always gotten along well with older adults according to my parents
2739,isfp,Im 28 right now. Of the two options. I say older. Frankly I much prefer speaking to people my own age. They understand my lingo better. Detest talking to high school aged people. They don't fucking listen. Love talking to children though. I have a soft spot for older people now that I work at a flea market. The average age around here is like fifty. I have grown accustomed to the way old people talk.
2740,isfp,"Nah you don't even know what you're talking about you old man, us high schoolers are intellectuals and superior to you old people. Im kidding haha, Im 17 and yeah I don't understand most people my age! "
2741,isfp,My problem is that I feel like people your age tend to view their selves as the protagonist in the story. Almost as if the world revolves around them. They wrap conversations around to talking about themselves a lot. Which is fucked up because we're supposed to be talking about me. I'm the protagonist. This is my story.
2742,isfp,"Also which instruments/sounds do you typically tend to focus on when listening to music? 
To me bass is often important, I also like the repeating piano chords in the background (kind of like in this one). I usually notice sounds that are more in the background than those in the forefront."
2743,isfp,"I think it just significantly helps on the journey of self discovery, and being content with ones self. Of course it's not perfect - but it can provide some purpose and belonging. Interesting at the very least."
2744,isfp,"It‚Äôs helped me understand why I am the way I am and to embrace it. If you can‚Äôt love yourself, no ones ever going to love you... or so the saying goes! Since learning this, both my personal and professional life have come up leaps and bounds! üòä"
2745,isfp,"Honestly. It hasn't helped me at all. It has given me a lot to read about and has consumed a lot of my time. In the end I am no different, and no closer to understanding anything as a result. It lead me to this sub and I have had a lot of fun reading the posts people put up here. Has it helped me. No. Am I glad I took it. Yes."
2746,isfp,"I‚Äôve never cared too much about whether or not I‚Äôve been in a relationship or not. I always loved Valentine‚Äôs Day bc I thought that pink and red were a seriously underrated color combo, while everyone else complained about being single. If anything, relationships seem more trouble than what they‚Äôre worth. I feel more at ease in my own company, and I often feel boxed in and constrained by other people. Is this an ISFP thing or is this just a me thing?"
2747,isfp,"I feel like what you're describing has little to do with romance, and more being single and having personal freedom. I dislike romance as in candlelight dinners, buying flowers, making grand gestures, but I very much do like being in a relationship (or rather, I know that not being in one would not be good for me). And luckily, I'm in a relationship that respects the need for personal freedom.
So, if you could have a relationship that allows you your freedom, and that does not require romantic gestures from you, would you still prefer to go it alone? "
2748,isfp,"Yeah I don't really wanna get married till I reach my own goals first. But if I do meet that special someone before I reach my goals then idk. I've never been in a relationship however I used to like this girl and she liked me back however I took too long and she doesn't like me anymore. I liked her for a while but I don't care much now. I doubt I will ever meet someone like her again but oh well. But yh I wanna travel the world boii let's go, I'm not eager to get myself into a relationship. My friends call me a free spirit :) "
2749,isfp,"I feel like I'm difficult to get to know in the dating phase. I like to spend a lot of time by myself making music, mixes/playlist and editing videos because my job is exhausting socially. I don't text or call my date very often and that can be misconstrued as me having little to no interest in the other person. I can't date extroverts because they have to have constant attention and need to text all day every single day and it just tires me out. Sometimes I'm really interested, but I just don't know what to say or how to initiate conversation. However if I do really get to know someone and like what I see I tend to ruin the relationship because I want to be around them a lot even if I'm not talking to them (just be in the same space).
I don't know relationships don't tend to work out for me. I unintentionally ghost in the beginning (they lose interest because I don't text/call back quick enough) or they ghost me later on because they think I've suddenly become clingy. I'm hoping my current dating situation works out :)"
2750,isfp,"I completely relate, but also disagree. I actually really do enjoy being single, and relationships seem like a lot of work. Valentine‚Äôs Day just feels like another day to me; I don‚Äôt love it or hate it. I‚Äôve never been very open about my emotions, and grand romantic gestures make me cringe so I can‚Äôt see myself ever being especially interested in anything like that.
That being said, because I‚Äôm so comfortable being single and never make an effort to show my interest, I‚Äôm about to turn 18 and have never even been on a date. I have a lot of friends (and most of my close friends are guys), I‚Äôm funny and friendly, I‚Äôm not especially ugly, I‚Äôm smart and have hobbies and talents and ambitions and blah blah blah but because I‚Äôm so uncomfortable with romance, I‚Äôve never even experienced it. I genuinely do like being single most of the time, and I like having independence and freedom and being able to make life choices without needing to consider how they would effect a significant other. But sometimes I do wish I‚Äôd at least experienced being in a relationship, and everything that goes with it. I‚Äôm definitely not romantic, but I really wish I was sometimes, because I feel like I‚Äôm completely just blocking out an entire chunk of life."
2751,isfp,"I think you‚Äôre right there! I guess a better title would have been not being interested in most relationships, because they usually feel constricting. I would be interested in being in a low pressure relationship (not worrying about gifts, how to dress for dates, etc.) That awesome that you‚Äôve found a relationship where you can be yourself! "
2752,isfp,"There's a great story in the beginning of John Dies at the End about a hatchet. One day the handle breaks, and a new handle is attached. Not long later, the blade breaks, so a new one is attached to the old-new handle. Is it the same hatchet? 
It ends there but here's how I take it. Now, as a collective of materials, it isn't the same at all. But as a construct with a purpose, it is absolutely the same as before. So are you a collective of materials, or a construct with a purpose? 
‚Äã"
2753,isfp,"Nothing can take you away from yourself. Even if someone can temporarily blunt your personality it will always comeback or you will fight against them and claim it back. Sometimes the not so great parts of our personality need to go away so that they can be replaced with better aspects learned through wisdom and life experience. You will always be true to yourself however. I've seen people change a lot over time for better or for worse (depending on how they handle things), but I've never seen someone's personality do a full 360. "
2754,isfp,"Every time i start to talk to someone im romantically interested in, i become completely obsessed with them. Im not talking stalker level obsession, just as soon as i know i want to develop a relationship i just can't. stop. thinking. about. that. person. This is actually my biggest problem that interferes with my mental health since i become sooo infatuated with that person i get depressed whenever things don't work and it takes me forever to get over it bc of how much i liked them. I always see posts of ISFPs having trouble with long term relationships but i feel like i have the opposite problem. Do any other ISFPs develop crushes really easily? or often become obsessed with liking their crush? "
2755,isfp,"hey :) ISFP girl here !
I'm always getting infatuated by someone I'm starting to get to know, and sometimes it's so frustrating because you know what's coming but you can't stop your heart from feeling sht. ahah
I wouldn't say I get depressed but I do get really sad, but that is only natural and it will eventually fade because it was never true love in the first place, it was just infatuation which is: attraction to somebody you don't really know, however what you do know is the idea you created about that person and that's what you ""love"", so it's not love hope it makes sense*. When I accept that it becomes easier to cope with my feelings, but there's nothing you can do to stop feeling stuff for other people because honestly that's beautiful so feel it all and go with the flow !!"
2756,isfp,"Wow. My now husband. It freaked me out when we started dating. ALL in early on. But in the other hand it took forever for him to open up about him. It was hard great me to adjust after awhile because, as I discovered later with most ISFPs his love was true and intense but the intensity is short lived. "
2757,isfp,"If im falling in love with someone, I've taken the time to actually get to know you and what you like, and I don't just care about your looks, I have to see an interesting personality that drives me to know more about the person. The most important part in relationships for me is personality. I fell hard for this one girl and I always thought everything she did was interesting. I romanticized everything about her, yet I still really find her interesting to this day which even though she's said she only wants to be friends with me. So I don't get crushes at all easily, but if I have a crush on someone, it's based on their personality, not looks. "
2758,isfp,"Not love, love, but the idea of love, and yes romanticising a person. I find as I've gotten older than happens less. Not fun to get your feelings hurt or your heart battered often. I'm quicker to recognize what is what and either shut it down, or just avoid romantic situations in general and focus on something else. IIWII."
2759,isfp,"I have kind of the opposite problem, actually. I rarely come across men who are even mildly attractive to me physically, and when I do, their personhood isn't usually attractive enough to keep me interested, even though I might continue indulging in the crush. I'd love to meet someone who creates the kind of romantic excitement you're describing, but I've yet to find a man who makes me feel that way on this level. "
2760,isfp,"Heck yes... and it's rough, especially if the person doesn't end up liking you back. But on the flip side of that, I can also fall out of love too easily too if I don't see it working out (although the initial pain of not having them there as a support system 24/7 can be rough). 
ISFPs seem to be the type to love most intensely, which makes sense, since I know a few ENTJs and they basically view relationships as a contractual obligation. Yeah, when you think about ISFP celebrities like Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, etc. you can see that their dating habits were heavily based on that strong initial feeling of love, which unfortunately doesn't always work out if the logistical compatibility isn't there."
2761,isfp,"Hi all, I‚Äôve had a really weird thing the last few days which I get quite often and does my head in. So I‚Äôm currently on my week off from work and I‚Äôve been having some time alone at home, my brain will go into the, ‚ÄòI want to talk to someone‚Äô faze, my cousin will get home after some time and my brain will just be like ‚Äòomg I want to be alone, jeez‚Äô and I‚Äôll be sitting there in afterwards like, can you make up your mind please!! Does this happen to other ISFP‚Äôs often? "
2762,isfp,"Yeah, it‚Äôs normal. I think it also depends just how much social activity you personally can take. I think I can take quite a bit, and I definitely crave it sometimes. However it also doesn‚Äôt take me long to want to hide away and regroup. Just the introversion in us, you‚Äôre all good!"
2763,isfp,"This is true for me, I spent 2 full days constantly around people earlier in the week, then yesterday was the first day I literally was alone and I think I was both greatful and in shock over it as I was exhausted... but there you go. It makes sense, today I have been fine, but I have been very much watching myself making sure I am ok, and so I‚Äôve not struggled with it. "
2764,isfp,"That's the Intraversion part of us. As humans, we wish to speak to someone. But as soon as someone comes along, the Intraversion kicks in and we wish to be left alone.
My closest friend is an ENTJ. I, almost always push him away, calm down, and apologize to him. Once he realised I'm ISFP, he understood the problem.
So I guess you'll have to find someone who understands the problem and won't be offended by you pushing then away. Perhaps an extravert. "
2765,isfp,"Oh I agree, the feeling of social exhaustion sucks. But I find I can regroup fairly quickly as I love the alone time. I get just how exhausting and draining it can feel sometimes. But you don‚Äôt need to stress it. Being aware it‚Äôs normal should help - you can try finding ways to make it easier. Such as limiting it as much as possible. Or finding a way to take breaks in the middle of these social days. Or maybe a diary type thing - I find that helps me. Whatever works for you.
Don‚Äôt feel down about it though, introversion is a great thing. Comes with many benefits that far outweigh the cons in my opinion. Good luck to you."
2766,isfp,"Which do you prefer: 1) person initiates contact, you push away, then later you initiate contact. or 2) person ignores you until you miss and contact person.  I've done it both ways with my ISPF.  With #1 I get contact sometime later but sort of close to when I want it.  With #2 I get the comfort of knowing she wants to talk."
2767,isfp,"I hope no one does #2 with me. Feels bad.
My ENTJ best friend can't respond due to work load. So I feel like he is ignoring me. But he takes time in between to respond and that makes me feel good.
I cannot give preference to either points though. But #1 happens a lot between my fiend and myself. This is mainly because he criticizes me on something (to make me improve). But ISFP's don't take criticism well, hence I push him away, feel bad and apologize for my childish behaviour"
2768,isfp,"If I like someone, I want to be in contact with that person A LOT. Like, always texting or hanging out. Stuff like that. Pretty subtle, but if I were asked about it, I'd tell them.
If I don't like someone and I was previously friends with them, I'll just ghost them. No conflict whatsoever."
2769,isfp,"ISFPs are very selective with who they spend time with or give their attention to. If they are spending any time or attention on you, I'd assume they like you. I've been with an ISFP for the last two years, and the only definitive sign that I had that she liked me was when I went to kiss her, we ended up having our first kiss. The rest is history."
2770,isfp,"Well I'm an ISFP and my best friend is a female INTP and I'm dating a male INTP... Needless to say, they always find they know really understand what I mean by certain things. I'm also pretty random on my reactions, like I spin a mental wheel and decide that's my reaction for right now... Both have described me as unpredictable and yet emotionally refreshing. So I'm not complaining."
2771,isfp,"I don't know about that. Ultimately, I just like to explore friendships. I'll hang out with work friends without intending (or even necessarily wanting) a close relationship. Grant it, it's not often, but it happens."
2772,isfp,"But I totally get where you're coming from. I've found myself actively prioritizing certain people in my classes when it comes to talking just because there's something in particular that I like about them. Then some of the other people, I sometimes kind of ignore. If I talk to you every day, it's because you've earned my seal of approval as a human being that I want to spend my time with. LOL"
2773,isfp,"That sounds about right. I consider myself a pretty empathetic person, but that seems to only extend to the people close to me and sometimes the people around them. I can't say I have much empathy or interest in strangers."
2774,isfp,"Hey everyone, I'm an ENFJ and I've been creeping your threads and posts. I love them all, you guys are just the cutest and I want to hug and upvote all of them. My boyfriend is an ISFP and I see a lot of him in your posts. You rock.
So what do you guys think of us? Likes? Dislikes? Something you wish you could change about us?"
2775,isfp,"Just in case you're posting this hoping to get insight into what your boyfriend thinks of you, I'll tap into the secret ISFP group-conciousness and check for you. :)
He's dating you because he thinks you're super awesome and date-worthy, and if there's anything he secretly wishes he could change about you, he's not saying anything because who you are as a person is much more important to him than satisfying a minor whim."
2776,isfp,"I believe at least one of my teachers was an ENFJ when I was in school..  I have a lot to thank her for.  She brought me out of my shell and inspired a lot of much needed confidence in myself.  I almost feel bad that I will probably never be able to repay her for all that she did for me, and I continue to feel that way whenever someone like that enters my life.  
I read that ENFJ/ISFP are supposedly a good combination for a romantic relationship but I just don't know how I would feel about that.  I think the ENFJ would overwhelm me with their love and I would worry that I wasn't giving enough back or something.  Is that an issue in your relationship?"
2777,isfp,"One of my best friends is an ENFJ and he's the shit. He ran cross country with me back in high school and there's no one like him. Ran my second marathon with him last week and I couldn't have done it without him. He's very unique in the way that he's ALWAYS thinking on the bright side, so with that said, he never fails to bring me out of my introverted shell. ENFJ's are AWESOME, they're warm, sympathetic, and just overall good people. "
2778,isfp,"There was an ENFJ guy in my childrens' literature class last semester. He had a perceiver manner of dress and was so warm I couldn't even. ENFJs are all so warm, ahhhh!
Justin Trudeau is probably an ENFJ. Pay attention to him. Possible next prime minister of Canada. I'm all for it."
2779,isfp,"Very warm but can be smothering.  Really generous and considerate of other people's feelings.  If there's anything I'd change, it would be that they're generous to a fault and need to say no at some point.
Basically a really happy, loving teddy bear that needs to remember to take care of themselves from time to time. :)"
2780,isfp,"Thanks for your response :) that was partially my intention but more to get into your minds. ISFPs are rather mysterious to me, you have a lot of creative insight that I only wish I had; and an appreciation for nice, simple things. I'm very often in my own head, but when I'm with ISFPs, it's very soothing and it balances me."
2781,isfp,"Thanks for your response :) 
The ENFJ/ISFP dynamic is really good. When we first started dating, he said that he found it really easy to be himself around me. I found him to to be witty, charming, sensitive, basically everything I want in a man. He has easy-going relationships with his friends, but he can open up to me about every single weird thing that he thinks of and I'll entertain and love it. 
Our arguments pretty much exclusively lie in our S/N differences. He likes to live in the here and now (which makes him very earthly, spontaneous, and observant), and I love to think about the future, which causes some conflict. I love mental games/stimulation, meta conversations; and he'd rather kick back with his friends or play guitar. He's a pretty simple dude and I usually have chaos or half-baked ideas floating around in my head, so I think my strong N is a bit boring or unengaging for him.  
To go back to your question, yes, that is sometimes a problem in our relationship. He'd rather take relationships at face-value, he does what he feels is right in the moment. I'm very intense when I commit myself to someone, I love very deeply and I try to make sure that he knows it. I suspect that it is smothering at times, and I try to reel it in as much as I can for his sake (especially with my words, he's more of an action kind of guy). "
2782,isfp,"This guy once came to class in a t-shirt, elbow-length fingerless gloves and a bandana, to go along with his wild curly hair. When I think ""J,"" I think of a more modest, utilitarian manner of dress than the wilder, wackier and more colourful ensembles of perceiver-types. ENFJs seem to subvert that trope.
I'll be honest - for the most part I find Fe irritating, especially in the case of ESFJs. My body of observation may not be large enough for me to definitively make this claim, but I feel as though ENFJs harness Fe in a more pleasing way than other Fe-users. Fe comes off as so insincere to me when I detect it, even when I know it's not. That was not the case with this guy. There was an aura about him - I found him very admirable."
2783,isfp,"Isn't that interesting, aren't ESFJs supposed to be your ""ideal"" type? I enjoy their company and think they're lovely people but I simply could not imagine a relationship with them, ditto for what you said above. With SJ types, I have a hard time dealing with the ""road block"" of conversation. They can be a bit single minded and deviations from the norm tend to unsettle them."
2784,isfp,"Just to make it clear, the online anecdotes about each type are often pretty one sided and flaunt stereotypes (though sometimes it's like someone spat back my entire life at me.) But point aside, I have found the ISFP descriptions even in Kiersey's book they seem to peg ISFPs as mostly-chill emo artists and irl as I have had more encounters with ISFPs and gained more knowledge of mbti, I have found that not to be true at all.
But the main question is have you all found the ISFP description to be especially vague?"
2785,isfp,"Yes. 
Most descriptions make us seem like INFPs but with less of a personality. I don't relate to being an artist at all (my ""art"" is terrible) and it seems like everyone tries to make it sound like all ISFPs are artists. A lot of people tend to not get to the heart of what an ISFP is about, so they just throw on very vague descriptions."
2786,isfp,"Often, yes, but we don't cry at every disagreement, stubbed toe, or used tissue like they make us sound.
In fact, like every other human being, we have logic, common sense, and do not operate solely on ""feelings"". Our Fi derives from personal values, not ""bases every decision off of whatever I feel at the time"". (Sometimes I really wonder what ISFPs the author has met because a lot of them make us sound like second graders). I think this is at least partly why other types like to mock and dismiss by going ""Found the Fi-dom!"" any time we show a strong opinion they disagree with.
Also, almost every ISFP description sounds sort of stereotypically girly: artsy, shy, sweet, sensitive, like messing with our hair/clothes/makeup. And that's great if you're feminine (a lot of us are!) but it almost sounds like the author is directing speaking to/about female ISFPs and also forgets that some women are tomboys. And while both men and tomboyish women can do some of those aforementioned things, it never feels like the description is taking them into account. I can't really explain it more clearly."
2787,isfp,"I know many people who either love it or hate it. Some of the sarcasm is very, very subtle which is why I find alot of people dont find it funny. 
I love it, not so much for some of the on screen jokes - but more so for the camera and realism of the effects and reactions - staying in tune with social cues of happiness, regret, sarcasm, akwardness, etc. 
Anyone else?"
2788,isfp,"I really liked it a lot actually but definitely preferred Parks and Rec, which just seemed much less... 'mean', for want of a better word. 
A lot of 'The Office's jokes with Michael Scott made me uncomfortable because it was just this jerk, using his power to be a jerk. I like the series much better when it moved away from his character.
Also, Pam is definitely an ISFP, fite me."
2789,isfp,"Was alright. I had it on the background while playing video games due to all the scenes involving michael scott that made me think ‚Äúalright thats enough shows for today‚Äù. My favorite parts were mostly side character plots, things involving dwight, and the last few season after michael scott left. "
2790,isfp,"I pop open the lid of my Wrigley's Orbit White Spearmint Gum. I pour out 2 pieces that are white with little green speckles. I put them in my mouth one at a time. One piece for each side of my mouth. I chew down. The gushing explosion of minty sweet freshness fills my mouth. 
The hard glossy outer layer of the gum slowly turning into a rubbery texture as I chew down on it. With each chomp, marvelous flavor pouring out. I can't control myself. I chew faster and faster.
7 minutes pass, the flavor not as prestine as it once was. I reach for the container and pour out another 2 pieces onto my palm, ready for another trip into paradise."

2792,isfp,So there's this guy I like who I think is an ISFP. He's shy but I get the impression he's really smart. But he is so innocent and adorable. What's the best way to keep an ISFP and not drive them crazy? I know relationships take time and energy and I have a lot of those but I don't want to like overwhelm him and shit. What is the key to your heart?
2793,isfp,"ISFP guy as well, great points made. The only thing I'd add is the importance of the ""live and let love"" outlook. We have deep, personal values, and it is essential that we live in an environment that allows us to ""live out"" these values. We don't try to change anyone else's, and in return we don't want ours changed, nor do we want a world in which we can't live out our values, creeds, ethics, philosophies, etc. 
I am personally quick to trust, however I immediately dislike a person if I sense that they have a hidden agenda or any type of manipulative ideas. 
Basically, let ISFPs be themselves. If you fall in love with one, we're true blue, to the core, as long as you let us. "
2794,isfp,"My brother is an ISFP (and he and I are quite close). He loves sharing his passions with others. (This is different than just liking the same thing.) Having a deep interest that both people spend hours and hours doing because they would do it regardless if that person was in their life or not.
ISFPs are also very aware of chemistry between themselves and people they date. If you don't feel a ""spark,"" it is likely they will not either. However, even if you do feel a ""spark,"" they may not. This can be tough to read, because IS_P types will sometimes try to create chemistry even if it is not there if they like someone. 
And while ISFPs do value their alone time quite a bit, they will also value their time with a significant other, provided that person knows them and ""gets them"" well enough to not make them feel drained or like they have to put on a front (which they will if they need to, whether or not you ""ask"" them to). "
2795,isfp,"ISFP Male here. Saw this post but I honestly think the ISFP youtube link in the side bar can give you the best information. 
Link for lazy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av0L9olZdco
Watching this and understanding myself, it's a good idea to make yourself known to this guy, and take it from there. Do not force anything, do not set up stringent deadlines or dates or anything set in stone. The ISFP is very day-to-day and spur-of-the-moment. If your relation with him grows and develops into any spontaneous quirks of his, that were never evident in his Shy classroom form, than there's a chance you're making it to his soft center.
The best advice I can give you is to be yourself, and allow him to get to know you. ISFPs are often perceptive, and they'll lay back in their own little world and watch you a bit before they decide to let you in. You just need to give him the time and evidence that you can care for him in such a manner, and let him be when he needs to recharge.
Actually, that's another great piece of advice. I will end rant after. ISFPs NEED recharge time. Time alone. Time to collect themselves. I can be rather social at the workplace or out with friends, but every day when I get home, I just lay in bed and relax. It's mentally and emotionally exhausting. If you can respect that and busy yourself with other things while the ISFP recharges, you'll see that more often than not he'll be coming back to you when he's ready. 
Okay, hope this helps. Good luck :)"
2796,isfp,"Interesting, I'm quite the opposite actually. I'd choose a passionate and romantic relationship over a friendshipish one any day. I'd want the kind of relationship you see in movies and stuff haha."
2797,isfp,"Yeah I'm always striving for that balance but it's hard. Mental connections, similar interests yeah all that stuff. He is pretty shy, and he's on the younger side too so I just have to slowly ease him out of his shell probably. Nice username by the way."
2798,isfp,Yeah that's why I think Esfp and Isfp make an awesome team. I am quick to trust too which is why I wonder if I'm not ISFP sometimes. In the end I know I'm ESFP but I think I was ISFP in high school. I hate people who have that stuff too. Hidden agendas and manipulative and stuff. I question if they're not another type. Maybe ESFJ or something.
2799,isfp,"Alright cool that's how I am as well, day to day and spur of the moment. We might go out to sushi and a movie some time this week. I'm completely cool with him having recharge time though since I know I'm a lot to handle and am on all the time."
2800,isfp,"Hello everyone ^^
As an ENFP, I got this strong need to share my thoughts and feelings so... here am I!
Anyway, I've been in a loving relationship with this sweet, gentle, caring male ISFP for like 5 months and everything is actually going great and very fast (I've met his friends and family, we've spent 2 wonderful weeks together at the sea, he has met my parents, ...). Btw I'm 20 and he's 2 years older.
Everything is perfect... except in my head. I have this constant feeling of ""we're not meant for each other"". Like we have needs we can't fulfill. Well, here are all my thoughts:
I feel like I'm all useless... when he's happy, it's okay but when he's down (oftenly), I feel like I can do nothing for him. If I'm useless in his worst moments, what's the point?? Yesterday, he was all sad and he only said stuffs like ""can't wait to see my bff tonight"" or ""I feel so lonely"" (even though I was hugging him). I try to understand him, I try to do many things to cheer him up (many acts of service, hugs and kisses, words of affirmation, making him laugh a bit; I even asked him to punch me if it can make him feel better xD)
But he'll only feel bad and will say ""don't bother yourself for me"". He doesn't understand that it is not bothering me... I try to listen to him but he has hard time to open up and share his feelings with words (typical ISFP). 
I know that I'm trying too hard and it's not my role to be his ""savior"" but still... we're supposed to be partners, a duo, and being with our SO should make us feel better...
I feel like he's with me because he's afraid that he couldn't get better, that he likes me a lot (lots of affection) but it's not ""love"". When he says that he loves me, it feels untrue. I feel like he needs to be understood but I can't understand him because we're so different. That there is not this ""connection"" (or is it just me as an ENFP?).
It's killing me. I want to cry all the time and even want to throw up while eating. I don't know what to do. I thought of breaking up many times because I don't see the point of this relationship (a bit idealistic but if we're not meant for each other, why should we stay together?). At the same time, I want to stay for his sake because it's a difficult time in his life (school being very stressing) and... I love him ^^
I know that MBTI doesn't resolve everything and that we are all unique but I'm in despair. I've already talked to him but it hasn't changed anything.
What are your thoughts/advice?
Sorry for the long post and thanks a lot for your reading. Have a nice day/evening :)"
2801,isfp,"Married to ISFP 5 years. I still can‚Äôt influence their emotions in any way, though I‚Äôve never felt that I needed to. Their Fi is just too strong. (I personally think that the only people who can cheer them up, are Fe-dominants, ENFJ or ESFJ). Let him feel what he feels. It doesn‚Äôt reflect less on you as a person."
2802,isfp,"Imo, this isn‚Äôt the most healthy relationship. On that though, the best thing you can do is based on your decisions/actions toward you two. You noticed you keep trying to help and be his savior, but we can‚Äôt change other people. Maybe a change in perception with that/seeing from the bigger picture that he will only change if he really wants to. 
Also, if you‚Äôre having ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not the one‚Äù thoughts, listen to your gut instinct, because ignoring it or hoping that feeling will change over time just won‚Äôt work. At least that‚Äôs how I see it. I‚Äôm an ISFP, and I‚Äôve been in very similar relationships."
2803,isfp,"Well thank you for your answers. I guess that I'm too empathetic or immature idk, I always want happiness for everyone and feel bad when I can't do anything about it. It's the first time I don't know how to behave with someone close"
2804,isfp,Uh you gotta have a talk where you let him in on some of this stuff. Thats where you need to start. If he doesnt know whats going on with you and youre building up negative thoughts and feelings it might start coming out as resentment so you need to clear the air and get you two on the same page. After that see what you guys have and decide whether its time to break up or not.
2805,isfp,"If it's making you sick, it might be a good idea to back off a bit. Go out with friends- get a pedicure, go see a movie. Just take your mind off the situation. You giving into your anxiety will only make the situation worse for you and him. It could push him to break-up with you too, if he feels like you can't handle the relationship.
Regardless of type, feeling that anxious only a few months into a relationship is not healthy.
If you feel like the relationship is wrong, it just might be. Ask yourself, what do you want from a partner- not just what do you want to give. Is he giving you this? If not, it could be time for a talk."
2806,isfp,"In the most significant relationship, it was the other person doing what you‚Äôre doing now. It was exhausting for him to think he had to ‚Äòhold the pieces of me together‚Äô, so to speak. He ended up taking time out of his life helping me. In the end though, it was like I had built up a wall that no one could get through, and whatever he said just went in one ear and out the other. I couldn‚Äôt have been helped by him or anyone else, only me. I saw that it broke him and I didnt realize I needed to change until it was all said and done, but it was something that only I could have gotten through my own head. Idk if its an ISFP thing or a personal thing, but my worst habit is getting so caught up in my own head and my own needs that I forget about the feelings or needs of those around me"
2807,isfp,You should check out r/codependency and learn more about what it can look like. I was like you in my last relationship. I know you're trying to take care of him in the best way that you can but it's really taking a toll on your mental health. Here's a helpful link https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/9dqqd9/signs_you_might_be_in_a_codependent_relationship/?st=JLRLM4XJ&sh=ffc8c0fe
2808,isfp,"dear OP, i felt this way about my first ISFP boyfriend and it turns out that my instinct as an ENFP, that it wasn't love, was something i was right about. he didn't agree at first when i wanted to break up, but after 7 months of being apart, he admitted that he was more afraid of losing the comfort and security of being together than wanting to be together with me. i saw that from a mile away because i had the intuition about it, so you have to stick to your guns even if doesnt see it right away, he'll come around to understand it later on. imho :)"
2809,isfp,"He seems like a dude that wants to just be himself 
Caring about/for somebody else or even being receptive in that way is a major security hole when it comes to life 
Look at divorce statistics and male suicide rates for statistics
I like to this of the song lite bright, it explains it perfectly for me
https://open.spotify.com/track/4nHsQ4S2gIrSJMitQ2y05d?si=eDoHCpGsSCSLrOxF7q_jhQ
You will HAVE to give him space. 
He will never change
That's not bad
It's who he is
Good luck :)"
2810,isfp,"Can you tell me more about your experiences with these ""similar relationships"", if you don't mind? :) I know I'm not his savior, but at least I want to be a good partner he can rely on when something's wrong... And for the ""not the one"" feeling, I don't know if I have to continue to believe to these kind of things. I'm trying to tell myself that a relationship is something you work on and that you should learn to love someone as the time passes by. But I'm only 20, I know nothing about life :') Anyway, thanks for your answer!"
2811,isfp,"Aw don‚Äôt feel bad, I actually like the ENFP ability to cheer me up, you guys are the bestest, you do you! How about this - try appealing to their minds instead of their hearts. Their Te (thinking) is easily influenced, so perhaps you can convince him that his situation is better, in a roundabout way. Just a thought!"
2812,isfp,"We give each other lots of freedom, I do see my friends and family, and still live my life outside our relationship :)
I'm actually very good at hiding my emotions, always being the happy puppy, so the one time I told him my insecurities, he was like ""wut"". We talked for a few hours about my needs and all, and I know that he's making great efforts about it but well... I guess I'm too needy haha"
2813,isfp,"Haha thank you, I feel a bit better. INFJ are great too, I feel so connected to them, always being weird together haha :)
Oh well, I've probably said the worst things then... he's mainly down because of his studies being hard, leading to a meaningless job (but well paid), told him that it's true, that he should consider something else because he will be so unhappy hahaha yeah I give some of the greatest advice"
2814,isfp,"Sorry if I came off as a bit harsh. What you're saying resonates with me a lot (even though I'm not an ENFP). I was trying to give you the perspective I wish I had had.
How did you feel about his response to you opening up as? I'm unsure exactly what ""wut"" entails lol"
2815,isfp,"Yes. Had all of my coworkers take the test. Only one older lady got ISFP. Oddly enough,I got along with her best. I was most comfortable around her and we could be silent around eachother with no awkward tension."
2816,isfp,"Charismatic, popular. He has people calling him and texting him whenever we hang out, asking him to hang out with them. 
Wears a lot of cool, overpriced clothes. Very hit-or-miss outfits. He struggles staying friends with girls because they end up falling for him or they think he‚Äôs flirting with them.
I live alone. He asks me if I get lonely. I say no, and he doesn‚Äôt get it at all but is pleasantly surprised.
He thinks his actions speak for him (‚ÄúWhy would I be hitting you up to hang if I think you‚Äôre boring?‚Äù is something he‚Äôs told me). He bikes and skates everywhere. He said that in high school he would throw textbooks across the classroom ‚Äújust to see what would happen‚Äù, got in trouble a lot but was very well-liked. He‚Äôs kept most of his friends from high school, while I‚Äôve kept touch with maybe 2 or 3. He parties or hangs out with a group every week.
He comes across very ISFP around me, probably because when we hang out it‚Äôs just us and he feels more comfortable being toned down. He tested as ISFP but there‚Äôs just no way, he loves partying way too much and gets lonely/bored very quickly. (I asked him if he wants to go to a coffee shop and he said no, because they‚Äôre ‚Äúboring‚Äù. Lol.) 
Failed Calculus like 3 times. It‚Äôs the only course left that he needs to pass to graduate but he doesn‚Äôt seem to sweat it, despite wasting money retaking this specific Calc course over and over again. 
He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúdeep‚Äù friend, and I don‚Äôt like seeing him that often, but he‚Äôs kind of interesting, because he‚Äôs just so different from everyone else I know. 
All my other friends have warned me that he sounds like a douchebag and I shouldn‚Äôt even associate myself with someone like that. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how long we‚Äôll know each other or why we hang out at all, but whatever. He‚Äôs usually the one hitting me up so if I‚Äôm bored we play video games and talk about music, sneakers, and his latest crazy story. He shows me new clothing brands to check out and has helped me fit in better to east coast trends after moving here from the middle of nowhere."
2817,isfp,"Very nice read! Was not expecting a reply this long! He sounds like a cool guy, can't relate to him at all though. Dang, I barely managed to pass Algebra 2 and this guy made it into Calculus. Smarter and more popular than me. Feelsbadman. "
2818,isfp,"Today I was having lunch with a friend. Then a YouTube notification came up. I checked it and it was a video of a newly introduced champion in a video game I play. In it, there is this girl engineer, and after a few moments I thought about how nice it is that people are introducing characters like this to break stereotypes and empower children. Then I thought about all the discrimination women had to endure to this day and the thoughts turned into feelings and they all overwhelmed me and I welled up, my eyes brimming with tears, almost spilling. My friend (girl) asked me (guy), ""What's wrong, your face is red?"" and I waved it away. People at next table were glimpsing at me as if I'm weird. (I was.)
A few days ago, I was listening to a Hungarian guitarist, and his sounds were beautiful but the way he conveyed them was even more beautiful. And I remembered this Spanish violinist whose music lifted me up from my severe, suicidal depression years ago. Then I was thinking that this guitar dude is ""literally"" saving people from death with his music. That moved me and I welled up and this time I was alone at home so I shed a tear or two and sniffled.
Does this happen to ISFPs too? I know some INFPs and they all attest to that this happens to them. I was wondering if ISFPs experience this too, since they are feelers too. There's no ISFP near me.
I feel as if my emotions are on steroids. These episodes are becoming more and more frequent in my life. Is this a symptom of some psychiatric condition?"
2819,isfp,"I can relate to this.  My emotions always seem to hit me hard, and I feel like I often have to keep a rein on them so I don't explode into super happy ecstasy, super sad depression, etc.  
It's definitely not exclusive to INFPs."
2820,isfp,"Yeah, it definitely depends on my mood.  One day I drank some tea and I thought it tasted so beautiful I almost got a tear in my eye (it was some amazing tea, not that plain old Lipton stuff).  I might also get emotional if I see a plant sprouting from a seed I planted, only if I'm in a delicate mood. But usually I am unaffected by material things, and the emotions are more likely to come from me remembering or contemplating something, like you said with the woman's equality example."
2821,isfp,Yes I bottle until I explode. It happens a lot when I really  don't want to do something and my anxiety about it has built up to a huge level. Also if I'm too tired or stressed. I also live in a bad environment for me and was abused emotionally and neglected as a child so I can get triggered easily by a lot which will cause me to get overwhelmed. I'm also a 22 year old guy if that matters. I have depression anxiety and ADHD innatentive. 
2822,isfp,I begin to get a lump in my throat occasionally when listening to certain pieces of classical music (Mozart's Requiem for instance). Watching those animal neglect videos featuring Sarah McLaughlin pretty much short circuits everything.
2823,isfp,"Sorry for the delayed response. I have it in a sense (har har). When I listen to music, I see colors, shapes, and sometimes entire pictures that correspond to the different textures and layers of sound. Likewise, when I'm looking at something outside like a building or a tree music will sometimes pop into my head. 
I'm not really sure if that's classic synesthesia, but there you go :-)"
2824,isfp,"It's not just you, INTP here that does the same thing; I create vivid and colourful landscapes which are each tailored to the appropriate theme of the song. I also associate colours to days of the week and similar immaterial definitions. I spoke to my ISFP friend and she does basically the same thing, so I'm not sure how well defined by type synesthesia is."
2825,isfp,"I don't have synthesia per se, but I do form strong associations between things of different sense groups, for example, I sometimes can hear a piece of art as a specific song or even make up music that describes it, sometimes music makes me think of pictures or things I've seen. But it's not subconscious, I choose to make these associations. "
2826,isfp,"I do! I have a color assosciation with letters, numbers, days of the week, people and emotions. 
Sunday - A light, pale yellow.
Monday - Slightly darker, more golden yellow.
Tuesday - Mustard Yellow.
Wednesday - Pale Grey.
Thursday - Black with thes slightest hint of purple.
Friday - Red. Cherry Red. 
Saturday - Plain grey.  
That's just an example. There's not pattern and I have no idea why I see them that way. I also see the numbers/words layed out in my head, like the numbers themselves are colored in. I sort of follow a path in my head which turns left at 20 and right at 100 then left at 120 again and so on. It's strange. Makes complete sense in my head but sounds confusing to many whom I try to explain it to.
EDIT: formatting."
2827,isfp,"I've do the thing with looking at something and music popping in my head. That's weird to read another person saying that. I never put the occurrence into words until just then, much less thought anybody else did that."
2828,isfp,"For example, let's say a bunch of people on the Internet are talking about how amazing a song is. I automatically want to dislike it. Conversely, when someone hates something, I often want to like it. Not sure why, though. "
2829,isfp,"I'll take a stab at the ""why""
I think we live by our own timelines which does not always move parallel to the pop culture timeline i.e. we're more likely to be influenced by our moods or our personal tastes at the time than a less personal* influencer like pop culture trends. "
2830,isfp,"If i do something and it becomes popular among people i start to hate it and i end up not doing it anymore(clothing for example), that looks pretty hipstery but i don't think i am.
Edit: i also don't like trends, like these retard challenges or games like happened with Pokemon GO."
2831,isfp,"If something seems inauthentic to an Fi user, they will hate it.  It could be that you find pop culture inauthentic.  Alternatively it could be an Enneagram 4 thing, where you simply want to differentiate yourself from everyone else.  There are quite a few ISFPs who are also Enneagram 4s"
2832,isfp,"I like to rant about society, philosophy, psychology, speculating about random stuff, gossiping/ranting about people I dislike, anime, jokes, and overall I always have stuff to say somehow. I wonder what sensors like to talk about though, feels like when they start talking about certain things I run out of things to say lol but I dont know if its a sensor thing or just me. I also wonder if its possible to exercise Se while talking about something. I'M REALLY CURIOUS PLS FEED ME "
2833,isfp,"I like listening to people and what gets them going... I also like talking about my current micro-passion, hobby or project or idea I might have right that moment. 
Every time when I'm in a group conversation and I try to contribute with an anecdote I kinda mess up the punchline and the story is anticlimactic.. I'm not good at articulating my thoughts "
2834,isfp,"I'm really curious about people, their interests and experiences and their overall view of life. I could be satisfied just listening to them about their worldview and opinions since I'm constantly on gathering-new-information-about-different-people -mode. Not too big on broad subjects like politics. Would be nice if we had some overlapping interests. 
Also, it's nothing to be ashamed of if you run out of things to say. Heck I do it sometimes lol. (Dunno if that's what you needed, but.) If you want to exercise Se while talking just do something while you're talking lol (at least that would be the easiest advice to give for me) 
Hope this helped!"
2835,isfp,i mostly listen to people. i dont talk much either because i‚Äôm afraid they won‚Äôt have the same level of enthusiasm as me or because i think they don‚Äôt care. those topics mostly being cars and games lol so i could see why i dont have tons of people to talk to
2836,isfp,"I love to talk about sociology/psychology/technology/economics (at a high level, even through I read to a minute level I find it hard to articulate and prefer to give overviews of how things in these areas connect). Usually these all relate to people and why people do/use things the way they do. I also like to talk about places/travel and people and their personalities :P I can be a bit bitchy when the people I'm with are being super nice and non-judgemental (do you not have ANYTHING to say) and then when I'm around super rude/judgemental people I usually stay out of it haha! (Enough people are shitting on this person, I should stick up for them or remove myself)."
2837,isfp,"It's like when my friends start talking about food and restuarants, I start going kind of speechless because I don't have anything valuable to add. I don't know anything about food, and they know things like how to identify the authenticity, texture, staleness blah blah of food. At least I can trust them to decide on which restuarant we all eat at lol"
2838,isfp,"Well biggest thing right now is looking at a new car... my girlfriend and I want to upgrade from a Land Rover Freelander to a Land Rover Defender. There was one in our budget for sale last week but we just missed it. So instead we're probably going for an Audi, either A4 or A6. Avant. 4-wheel drive. 
Also I want one of those gimbals for my phone to film stuff with. I already do photograph our travels but now I want to start to make movies also "
2839,isfp,"Every single day. I browse Reddit a lot, and post a lot. I work at a front desk, and a non insignificant amount of my time is just sitting waiting for work to come to me. I like Reddit. I like to proofread anything I am about to post. About a third or so of the time I realize it isn't relevant to the original posting, or it just flat out doesn't make sense as written. I feel you."
2840,isfp,"Fi is so hilariously unprofessional. I was at Walmart trying to find an item today and ended up asking a guy stocking shelves if they had it in the store. He grabs his phone and starts looking stuff up and then the conversation goes something like this:
Him (long haired hippy looking dude): ‚ÄúEhhhh...it looks like we have it online but not here in the store. But you could order it and pick it up here on May 8th and the shipping is free. Ooh! Or you could have it sent straight to your house for just a couple more dollars. Same delivery date.‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúAwesome, is that something you could do here or do I have to go home and look it up online?‚Äù
Him: ‚ÄúI mean, I could...it‚Äôs just...well I did that once, for a customer...and it turned into this whole thing....like I had to use my card then he had to pay me back, which was weird ya know...and then his order arrived on my day off and I had to meet him up here to sign for it and the whole thing was just....you know.....‚Äù
Me: ‚Äú...totally not worth it?‚Äù
Him: ‚Äúyeah, exactly.‚Äù
Everything about the guy, from the irrelevant rambling anecdote to the willingness to be helpful mixed with that jaded ‚Äúno good deed goes unpunished‚Äù perspective reminded me of every job I‚Äôve ever had in customer service.
Why is everything such an ordeal for us? üòÇüò©üò©üò©"
2841,isfp,It physically pains me to be anything less than 110% helpful and I don‚Äôt want to tell even a white lie about not being able to help but I also get super burned when it goes wrong but I still feel guilty setting boundaries so I have to now tell you my whole life story so you dont judge me OH LOOK A UNICORN üòÇ
2842,isfp,"resonates with me and my time working at a clothing store- I feel like I was probably acting way too friendly/casual with customers, but I think it was probably helpful for some sales I made. I just tried to have fun and joke around there honestly, it made the job a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be. being professional is just so hard for me to fake 
makes me want to go back, but initiating contact with hundreds of people every day and trying to sell stuff that's not personal can be very tiring"
2843,isfp,"This is hilarious. I'm no hippy and can see myself in this. I'm full of anecdotes because I think my experience has relevance in decision making at work. Is this that terrible?
‚Äã
What's ironic is I want to be taken seriously at work. I really struggle."
2844,isfp,"It's delightful to see how Fi's very existence is about managing the balancing act between this combination of respect and empathy and one's own interests. Well, not always... when you guys bottle it up for too long, it becomes quite unfair. Seen this in a tragic way in my INFP crush."
2845,isfp,"Haha I love it! Sometimes I work cash register and luckily I haven‚Äôt been hit with any situations yet.. but you bet that when a customer says something like ‚Äúhm I‚Äôm a bit short, can I just get off?‚Äù I‚Äôll no doubt say yes and get in a lot of trouble :) 
I almost gave someone a refund once (which I‚Äôm not even allowed to do) for a mistake she personally made. I felt bad, what can I sayü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
There was also this one time a lady changed her food order while being cooked. So there I was like ‚Äúyeah okay sure let‚Äôs just change that for you‚Äù until my sweet on the surface coworker was like ‚Äúuh, no. She‚Äôs getting what she ordered‚Äù. I was pretty impressed! I love the way we‚Äôre very hard workers, but also pretty unprofessional in doing so lmao."
2846,isfp,"100% agree!
I‚Äôve given away too much free shit. Also with the ordering online thing, as a customer I just flat out asked the sales person if I could just order what they didn‚Äôt have in stock online lol. They gave me this are you serious face lol. He than said he could order it in, it may take a few months (the town is remote Australia) and I had to also then get them to post it to me because I didn‚Äôt live in that town. I accepted of course even though it cost me 10x as much and taken months longer then if I had just ordered online ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è story of my life..."
2847,isfp,"me when someone asks me a questions at work: oh there's this and this. and oh! one thing i had trouble understanding was this so i figured it out with this. and you might encounter this so this is the workaround! and don't forget this!
when i ask someone else a question at work:"
2848,isfp,"I had a very brief stint as a telemarketer one summer when I was in college. We got paid on commission, which meant I pretty much worked for free because I only made a few sales, ever. I‚Äôd be like: ‚ÄúHi Mrs. _! This is , calling on behalf of the ___ Symphony Orchestra and I would like to tell you about our upcoming concert seri‚Äî‚Äú
(Them): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested.‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúOkay! Thanks anyway, have a great night!‚Äù
-/click"
2849,isfp,"Ooooh yeah, the explosion of pent-up resentment. That happened to me more when I was younger and nicer. Nowadays I just awkwardly express my annoyance whenever it surfaces so it can be addressed immediately and everyone can move on.
I‚Äôm....not sure if that‚Äôs an improvement."
2850,isfp,"that reminds me of one of my sales jobs I had a few years ago, we had to contact people by phone/text and I was so bad at it, even texting I always felt my wording was wrong. my co-worker was great at putting on a professional facade but I couldn't do that. I was also just really shy at that time. but I also really did not care about our products(was all skin care/health stuff and a lot of it seemed snake oily to me) so I was a bad fit at that place. it was also commission but we still had a wage, I probably made like 15 sales in ~10 months 
also a few times I had to stand outside a grocery store and try to get people to sign up- that sucked. so many people just flat out ignore you, whenever I see people doing this type of thing I always try to at least say something to them and be polite"
2851,isfp,"Same here, I did telemarketing for one week selling something very similar.  Made one sale from people who would have subscribed anyway. After that week I just never showed up for work lol. Didn't even call to say I quit."
2852,isfp,"Maybe? I mean, talking about it shows you who you can trust with your emotions and who'd most certainly act like a dick on it at best. When I was just a little bit younger (I'm 18 now, so much about that...), I used to mock at people who acted awkward in any way, because my mindset went like (""Those ugly cripples are so weak and stupid!""). Classic PoLR Fi absence of understanding emotional pain/respecting boundaries, sigh. 
A hint I think is very useful to high Fi users is to play a quid pro quo game with values: Whoever doesn't respect yours/have them is worth to be attacked. It's no charter to act just as foolish, it just shows that you aren't responsible for their feelings anymore at this point and it's their fricken deal."
2853,isfp,"When my boss told me she appreciated me I got super tense and uncomfortable and I'm like ""uh. Th-thanks..?"" (What do I say??)
I barely tell my boyfriend I love him even though I do. I just express it with touch and actions more.
In general I don't like saying I love you to friends because saying it feels forced or disingenious (even if it's not). 
Words aren't really a hefty enough material, man."
2854,isfp,"Isn‚Äôt it so weird that we, in spite of being Fi-doms, have so much trouble expressing ourselves and how we feel? With anything so important to me and near and dear to my heart, I hardly ever talk about it, but if it‚Äôs something I care about on a surface level, I can talk endlessly about it. And then I get told that he wishes I love him as much as he loves me, and I shut down and feel like a failure because I have no idea how to communicate the way I feel, making it seem like he‚Äôs right. üòî"
2855,isfp,"That does it, I‚Äôm changing my flair to ISFP. Emotionally, at least. 
I‚Äôm great with words, but only if I don‚Äôt have to say them to your face. Anything that requires honest, open sincerity makes me incredibly uncomfortable, to the point where I‚Äôve wondered whether I have some undiagnosed social disorder because even saying, ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel well‚Äù caused me to freeze up. Ugh. 
To your other point, my love language is definitely gift-giving. But he also giving the gift to someone else to give because showing affection is the worst. "
2856,isfp,"Yes! I‚Äôve had to kind of teach myself to tell my loved ones that I love them. I‚Äôve just learned that it‚Äôs easiest for me to compliment people on little things, so that they KNOW that I do care about them, even when I suck at showing them or seem a little aloof. I get pretty bashful with more meaningful compliments, like you said about being appreciated:)."
2857,isfp,"Oh cool my boyfriend is intj as well. Yeah idk I'm just not into talking I guess. I'd rather send a surprise pizza to your house or make you a gift or help you move or give you a massage rather than express my affection with words. Makes me feel weird when people want me to do that or if people do that to me. Idk I hate being ""mushy"" or ""fluffy"". "
2858,isfp,"That's an ISFP thing. We feel like saying I love you, or saying thank you are just empty words. Because we don't feel them.
On the other hand, taking the time to make a gift by hand, or sending a surprise pizza is a way to show that we love insert person(s) here
This is probably because ISFPs are lazy and laid back. If we go out of our way to do something for someone, it means that person means the world to us."
2859,isfp,"I can express written concern with friends if I‚Äôm not with them or if I‚Äôm able to otherwise come across as flippant or insincere (most of my close friends know, paradoxically, this is just how I express concern). But I can‚Äôt even manage that with family, I just get anxious and then angry. 
This is fascinating, I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only crazy one! I have a theory it‚Äôs an extreme aversion to vulnerability. Even being very sincere about that sort of thing feels like pulling teeth. "
2860,isfp,"A similar feeling here haha, vulnerability is a good point. I always wondered what's wrong with me when my mom or sister is coughing up a lung and I can't bring myself to say a thing, it's not like I don't care...sometimes I manage to do the flippant thing. I also like you said above have a really hard time telling them if I don't feel well. "
2861,isfp,"Hey ISFP folks! First time here, but I want to get right to my inquiry - I'm a male INFJ attending university, and a girl in one of my gen-ed classes has recently caught my eye. From everything I've observed (I'm usually very good at typing people) she seems very much to be an ISFP. I was paired up with her for a partnered project and I've spoken to her a couple times before class, very casual conversation. I don't have her phone number or anything like that, I definitely felt it was too forward to ask so soon. One thing that is definitely different for me is that she's the first introvert I've ever really taken an interest in. I tend to go for EXXPs. However she's definitely quiet, and particularly not all that verbal, as I would expect of most ISFPs. I've also been out of the dating game for a while, since high school, so this is new for me in more than one aspect. 
In general, I'm interested in any advice you guys have for me - with only a couple of classes left in the last couple weeks of school, what are things I can do to spark a solid conversation, get to know her better, flow into more regular conversation, etc.? What are things I should keep in mind, things I should avoid, all the basic stuff. Anything at all will help! I appreciate you all in advance taking the time to help me out with this very new endeavor hahaha"
2862,isfp,"Treat her like you would any other acquaintance. Ask her what her interests are, share some of yours, whatever. Just don't push for personal information too soon or she'll probably shut down. Above all, just be polite and gentle.
On another note, I am sick and tired of all these people posting in the MBTI subreddits asking ""I'm X type, how can I attract this Y type?"". Oh, I don't know, why don't you just be yourself and treat them like a normal person? The MBTI is designed to give a basic understanding of people's behavior. There is no 'catch all' to attract a certain type. There is no 'cheat code' to make them love you. We are all humans here, act like it.
I'm not mad at you, OP, I just wish certain redditors would stop taking the MBTI so seriously."
2863,isfp,"I think its best to avoid typing someone unless you're very close to them or they've taken the test.  I know its hard when you're so into MBTI but its just better not to have any projected preconceptions when you're getting to know someone.
That said, I think you're probably empathetic enough to realize when you're pushing her buttons.  Just be yourself.  Maybe after enough conversations, add her on Facebook if she uses it.  That way you can keep contact with her after classes end."
2864,isfp,"That's okay haha... I didn't mean for it to be one of those posts, I see them often too and while I like MBTI I don't think it should be overstressed to much with stuff like this. More than anything I was just interested in how ISFPs would prefer to be approached and whatnot, I don't have much experience with them at all, although you guys are a cool type! Thanks for your reply"
2865,isfp,"Like I said earlier in the comments, I'm pretty much just looking for insight on how to approach it since verbally, ISFPs are so different than INFJs. Of course I'll be myself, I was just hoping for some ISFP perspective. I'm not trying to learn some special secrets to manipulate her or something. "
2866,isfp,"I just like being approached, period. Like, ""whoa, this person is genuinely interested in me, that's new.""
I know INFJs have (inferior) Se, so try and tap into that malfunctioning function and you may end up appealing to your ISFP's sensibilities. Tell her you like her ensemble. Tell her she has pretty eyes or pretty hair. Tell her she has a cute laugh. Make an inference about her opinion on something or her emotional state based on her body language. I, too think that the professor is coming off as a dunce. Ask her if she's nervous or stressed about exams and if she says yes, say that you're nervous and stressed too and that it's almost over, we're gonna make it!!! An INFJ girl I recently met managed to sink her fangs into me by complimenting my outfit. Now we're friends.
Use that dominant Ni to come up with ways of appealing to (what should be) her strong empathy and her internal values and her eye for pretty things. I barely understand Ni and I can count the number of IRL friends I have on one hand but I'm a bubbling crockpot of ideas when it comes to establishing connections with people (when I want to do so). Go. Gogogogogo.
One more thing, actually. If she's anything like what I assume other ISFPs are like, she'll have a sixth sense for detecting insincerity, so try not to Fe all over her, lest you come off as obnoxious or fake."
2867,isfp,"Thanks, I like INFJs too. I mean, like I said, just be kind and gentle and don't push her to talk about things she doesn't want to. That's about as specific as it gets but I see people on here all the time expecting some sort of exact guide on how to win them, and that's what irritates me."
2868,isfp,"This is great! I'm not great at giving compliments, I always feel awkward with it, but I'm sure I can find the courage to mention something haha... As far as connecting with my Ni I can certainly do that, as long as I don't overload myself with ideas.
I think this might be the trickiest thing for me, because she (as most ISFPs, I would guess) seems to be more of a does than a talker, and not all that verbal, and as an INFJ I'm primarily verbal in communicating and probably talk more than I do things haha - I have lots of Fi users as friends, and they can get overloaded or annoyed with my Fe after some time. "
2869,isfp,"Like the title says, as an isfp, what is your favorite mbti type?
My husband is an ENFP, and i think we go really well with each other (..most of the time). I like ENFPs positive outgoing personality and being very open and understanding while knowing how to be goofy and fun.
But in general, i enjoy the company of extroverts more than introverted types. I like bouncing my thoughts off of them since ISFPs arent natural conversation starters. Bc usually if im with other introverts, as an extroverted introvert, i usually end up steering the conversations which gets pretty exhausting and boring after awhile. "
2870,isfp,"Anyone in their mentally healthy state. All types can be hard to deal with when they‚Äôre in the grip of their inferior function. But that said, I like INTPs, ISTPs, ENFPs, ISFJs, ESFJs, INFJs generally speaking."
2871,isfp,"Good Morning Reddit! Here is Episode 3 of the podcast! If there are any questions or commments that you would like to add, drop a comment below on the video :) Thank you!

‚Äã"
2872,isfp,"He could very well be! He seems uncomfortable with praise and undersells himself- definite ISFP trait. He seems pretty anxious and uncomfortable in the interview setting -ISFP introversion and fear of public speaking. It seems like he has trouble verbalizing his thoughts and looks up for a minute and thinks before he says anything- very ISFP. He seems warm and bubbly and smiles a lot when he's talking- arguably an ISFP thing. However, this interview alone doesn't give me enough clues to be totally sure of it. "
2873,isfp,"In response to some posts i have seen where IxFPs call people who open up to them ""toxic"" and claim they were ""forced to ghost them"". People who share everything with you are not necessarily toxic, and it is most certainly not ENTIRELY their fault that they have one sided conversations with you. Friendships involve give and take, which means if they share with you a lot, it might be nice to do the same. Can you truly blame them for expecting a little bit of trust from a person who they trust so much? 
You Fi doms often have issues with sharing and communicating. Sure you are great listeners, but what if somebody actually wants to get to know you? I know in my case i was head over heels and i wanted to become closer, i thought if i shared with her she would share with me... nope. She continued to treat me like i was nobody. When i said that i liked her, she told me she ""wasn't ready for a relationship"" instead of telling me the truth (she just doesn't like me that way)... which i eventually dragged out of her. AND I WAS FINE WITH THAT. She said she wanted to stay friends, and i believed her. But all of a sudden, no texts, no hanging out, no saying hi at church... and when i asked her about it she made a bunch of excuses, and told me that she was distant with ALL her friends... who i clearly saw her talking to and laughing with whilst she ignored me... I wasnt mad that she didn't share, I wasnt mad that she didnt care about me, i was furious that she lied to me and caused me to waste so much time and effort. I made an effort to tell her the truth, in all the time i knew her, and all she ever did was play along. And when things got even the tiniest bit uncomfortable, she kicked me out of her life, and LIED to me because she was to scared to tell me the truth.
I know there were an awful lot of ""I""s and ""me""s in this post... but i just want to let everyone on this sub know that ghosting, ignoring and lying are INFINITELY worse than just telling the truth and getting it overwith. Lying to somebody doesn't protect them, it protects YOU. So even though its hard, be honest with people... and dont pretend to be their friend if you're not. K im done."
2874,isfp,"Always best to use tit for tat( mmh dictionary seems to only think this is negative like punishment. Where as I think of it as neutral). For example, if you call her. Then next time she has to call you.  If she cares, she will call. If she does not then game over and not much wasted."
2875,isfp,"Doing what is easy for you, at the expense of somebody else, is selfish and also wrong. Just because its easy for her to ghost me doesn't mean she should. I haven't done anything to deserve this. And just to be clear, i dont want a relationship anymore. And i am no longer attracted to her. We were legitimately good friends before... but now we are not. For no reason. Life isnt just about being comfortable, its also about being considerate, and effective. Im not accusing her of being a bad person, im just letting you all know that if you dont want to hurt somebody, dont ghost them. "
2876,isfp,"But i was as honest as humanly possible. I let her know she was important to me. Im INTP so i realize we operate on different frequencies, but i put as much as i could out in the open. I also researched her type and tried my best to understand her... she didnt put any effort into the friendship. "
2877,isfp,"If a friend had told me that they had feelings for me‚Äîthat I didn't reciprocate‚Äîit would change the relationship. Regardless of her conduct, you mustn't expect things to just go on as they were.  
If you're willing to listen to a recommendation (forgive me if you're not): move on. Perhaps if she sees you've fallen for someone else, any lingering concerns might be mitigated, and a platonic relationship could be rekindled.
 Personally, I don't think it's healthy to hope/expect for something like that, and it would be better to cut your losses, and find new friends.  

From the OP:
From the information provided, it seems like you made your romantic overture, and she rejected you in such a way as to reduce harm, or to not make you seem generally undesirable. I can only imagine forcing the topic (dragging out more information) would seem super gauche and uncomfortable. My hunch is that she sees you differently now (but I don't know; I'm not her).  
Human to human: I'm sorry you've been through this/ are going through this. I think it happens to most people. I know it's hard. 
You will have many more relationships."
2878,isfp,"There is give-and-take in a relationship, but it‚Äôs also important to respect other people‚Äôs boundaries. She may still be young and working on balancing tactfulness with directness of communication(a lot of the behaviors described sound like typical popular girl politeness), but consider also that she repeatedly told you that she didn‚Äôt want to go on a deeper level with you, and you responded by becoming more intense (in your own words, dragging information out of her- edit: information that it sounds like you already knew, but just wanted to confront). It‚Äôs a natural response to withdraw from a relationship when you feel that your needs and wishes are not being respected. And while it may be frustrating, personal feelings are personal, and people are not automatically obligated to share them just because you asked. "
2879,isfp,"I may be biased because my relationship with an INTP is spiralling down to the apathy abyss, but really, if you're not in the same frequence as her, don't try. She knows that. She tries to push you away so you won't remember her. But she doesn't want to hurt your feelings, that's why she is trying to push you, so it's less painful to you. But, again INTPs are not like that. We have to explain everything (I myself am sick of that).
I may be downvoted but that's my experience, and the only advice on what she may be thinking."
2880,isfp,"If she doesn't want to be friends anymore it would have been better to say so. instead of insisting we stay friends only to treat me like a stranger. It is annoying because i thought the same thing you did, that it would be better to just move on, i even asked her about it, and she was all like ""no no no it wont be awkward!"" And then she just started ignoring me... if it was awkward she should have just said so, then we could take a break or end the friendship with no hard feelings. A friendship involves both people, if you want to end it, its only fair to let the other person know."
2881,isfp,"Well if she didn't want to be my friend she shouldn't have kept insisting we ""stay friends"". I used the word ""drag"" because she wouldn't give me a direct answer untill i called her and asked her a direct yes or no question. I did everything i could to be nice, i tried to make sure she felt comfortable telling me if there were problems, i even came here and did research and asked questions. I put in a lot of effort, and she did nothing but give me hot and cold signals, ignore me in person, and eventually block me because i sent her a meme, afterwards ghosting. 
She has been the worst, and its over now, but there have been other people who i have seen that exhibit very similar behavior, which is why i am here to let you know that choosing not to communicate does more harm than good."
2882,isfp,"People dont lie and ghost because its less painful for the other person. They do it because its easier for them. Its just selfish. And i know its not CONSCIOUSLY selfish, but deep down inside its not about the other person. Im pointing this out to Fi types because they often have problems being assertive. 
Advice for you, we need things explained because nothing is actually simple, and the why is more important than the what. Its not exactly our fault that you are insecure/bad about expressing your thoughts."
2883,isfp,"Well, I don't know exactly what's going through her mind (obviously), but some people have a lot of trouble just being candid, and will white lie themselves‚Äîand the other person, to their thinking‚Äîout of sticky situations. And there are likely some people that will cope better hearing a white lie, than facing a blunt truth (but not you, as you've made clear).  
(My guess is that it's a damage control thing, in order to reduce potential upset in the short term.)"
2884,isfp,"Well I don't like that thing about INTPs. There's plenty of people that does get these things. I won't tolerate someone because ""it's their personality"". I'm not happy with him, I don't have to stay in that relationship. "
2885,isfp,"Oh no, I don't habe communication problems. You see, it's been 5 years with him. I didn't care to tell him what to do, because he reciprocated me with affection. Last year he fell into depression, and I took care of him every day, because I loved him. That drained my mental health (I didn't have friends and had a lot of work, and had to make my bf happy because he was deppressed, but I understand that so I took care of him. Everybody has bad times.) But you know, this year, I AM the one who's deppressed. He won't do shit. He don't even kiss me or hug me or some shit. I'm fucking deppressed and he doesn't fucking move a finger to do anything. And you know what? I told him! I told him that I'm sad, that this year is rough, that I'm not happy and I need support. But he won't care. Instead, he would sometimes come home and say ""oh you know, lately i'm feeling so happy!""
THAT FUCKING HURTS. It's not communication problems. You're not fucking perfect. Logic is not truth.
If you want logic in your relationship go find an NT girl. We SFs are not made for that."
2886,isfp,"First of all, i dont think theres an INTP out there who thinks they're perfect. I certainly dont. 
Second, logic IS truth. Or rather the process by which truth is reliably reached.
And third, we NTs are not made for being nice to people or comforting them, yet society demands that we learn how to do it. So its not too much to ask for the feelers to take a step back and THINK every now and then.
I hear what you are saying. I have three sisters, all feelers, and they get pissed at me for similar things. I DONT KNOW HOW. I have no idea how to comfort people, and im very bad at realizing when people are sad. I would try telling him that you need empathy... it may sound silly to say it out loud, but let him know that you are depressed ALL the time, and that you need him to help you through it. He will either try his best to comply because he loves you, or he will not because he doesnt. Either way you get and answer, and it makes a heck of a lot more sense than just staying mad."
2887,isfp,"I told you I've been 5 years with an INTP. I know what you are. I know how to treat you. But you don't know how to treat me. I'm sick of that. I even wrote him a fucking book about feelings when we started dating, because you know, I kind of loved his quirkyness. I feel like a napkin with him. After all the things I did for him, how much I loved him, and hell, how much he loved me... Now it stopped because I am the one that's sad now? Fuck that. 
Do you know how it's like to be sad all the time? All I wanna do is fucking sleep forever. I already told him that I'm sad. If he doesn't do anything, he's just an asshole. And I'm beggining to feel like shit because I'm not even worthy of being sad. I CAN'T BE SAD. Because oh noes, the relationship fails.
So, you need an advice? That socionics shit about duality can suck ass. Go after an NT girl, you'll be 100 times happier. I'm gonna go with an SF man after this shit.
If I offended you I'm sorry. Just sharing an experience... I have emotional memory."
2888,isfp,"Maybe he is an asshole, maybe he's confused. Any relationship can work if both individuals are mature... And yes, I've been sad for very long periods of time. If you're determined to end the relationship, i cant stop you. But im sure there are 2 sides to the story. There always is... its just difficult to know which side is the right side sometimes. Might i ask your age out of curiousity?"
2889,isfp,"We are both 20, so I think maturity is a big thing here. We've changed afterall.
And, in relationships is hard to determine a ""right side"". Unless it's ethicaly obvious like violence or abuse.
I will always respect him, but not his last actions. 5 years are lots of years (at least for me, it's like 1/4 of my life...). It's been good while it lasted.
If you want more info, for our contract with the landlord we have to stay together until june. My plan is to avoid the feeling part (as he does rn), maybe some anti depressants would help too but I don't want to rely on meds for now. I will get my affection from family and friends I guess..."
2890,isfp,"Hey, GreggWilliamsMcstick, just a quick heads-up:
curiousity is actually spelled curiosity. You can remember it by -os- in the middle.
Have a nice day!

2891,isfp,"As an idea to break out of the capitalist way of thinking and proving to yourself that you don‚Äôt need materialistic items to be happy, I think it‚Äôs a great step forward for anyone. Its less wasteful and promotes behaviour that will benefit the environment and everyone on this earth. It‚Äôs something I practice and want to explore further. "
2892,isfp,"I am actually very interested in Living a minimalist lifestyle and i look up to it.    I don't think i want to live a minimalist lifestyle for my whole life tho just until i retire.
just for my young years when i start working onto maybe 35-45 years old?   And save all my money not spending it on stuff i don't need. 
so i could be using capitalism to my advantage by living a minimalistic lifestyle still try to get a nice hardworking job so i can retire early.
‚Äã
i  love the idea of of being a successful person but living relatively humble lifestyle with only the base essentials and hiding my wealth so no one will judge you for it and use you.
‚Äã
just recently iv'e had a rain check on why material privileges can be hurtful and damaging. As it can always be taken away from you and leave you behind.
‚Äã
‚Äã"
2893,isfp,"I watched a documentary on it on Netflix (called minimalism lol) and I LOVED it and made everyone I know watch it. I initially got rid of a lot of stuff after watching it, and have been better about getting rid of stuff I don‚Äôt care about, but I‚Äôm definitely not a minimalist, and I continue to be extremely messy. I think I love minimalism in theory, but not in practice. Tbh, I think I got super into the documentary because the videography and music was absolutely beautiful, and as stereotypical as it sounds, I wanted to become a minimalist just for the aesthetic lol.
I‚Äôm definitely more of a minimalist when it comes to clothes. I say all the time that I wish I could be like Steve Jobs and wear the same outfit everyday, but I‚Äôm a girl and I‚Äôm still in school, so if you wear the same thing over and over, people start asking lol. But if I could, I would wear my nice fitting San Francisco navy blue sweatshirt, skinny jeans, and my checkered vans every single day. Choosing clothes everyday seems like a needless hassle, and the whole fast fashion business is disgusting in its general treatment of workers."
2894,isfp,"I'm trying but I also love antiques and find it hard to throw precious things away. I 100% agree though, life is better with less. I'm fascinated by people who live in those ""tiny houses"" with minimal stuff. I'd love to try it."
2895,isfp,Sometimes i worry that im a narcissist. Sometimes i cant tell if i feel inferior to people or if i feel superior to people.  Like if im a narcissist then I have a grandiose self image. since  being a narcissist is a bad trait being one would threaten my grandiose image so of course id be paranoid that im a narcissist. Anyone scared they might be a narcissist?
2896,isfp,"Yes, sometimes. Where most people have the problem that they compare themselves to other people too much, I have the opposite problem - I don't even know how to compare myself to other people. To me each person is a unique and separate individual with their own thoughts and feelings. I usually compare myself to the 'big picture' I have in my head, with other people included. I don't know if that makes me narcissistic though. But I've done ~~narcissist-like~~ things that could be seen as narcissistic too and worry about them now and again."
2897,isfp,"I do too. At times I think I might be a covert narcissist. I have been with people who made me doubt my perceptions a lot too. This might be more of a mental issue than an ISFP thing, but when I'm in a ""burning"" (""hyped"", ""reckless"", if you get what I mean, I don't know exactly how to say it) phase, I tend to be insanely overconfident, I have delusions of grandeur (like, I'm going to start a new trend, I'm going to be the best at x thing, I'm loved by x person, I am limitless), I'm very impulsive, ""end justifies the means"" mindset, and determined to get what I want the point of ruthlessness. But it's likely that if you are worried you are a narcissist, you actually aren't one, because narcissists usually don't think about things like that. Again, I might be wrong about it. Have you tried to talk to a professional? "
2898,isfp,"Definitely have gotten this feeling before. Especially when I'm with someone who is very complimentary, or when I'm receiving a lot of praise. Sometimes I feel like I like it a little too much and it freaks me out because being a narcissist is the last thing I want."
2899,isfp,"This table on the schizoid personality wiki page has my number . .

feeling inferior and an outsider in life | hidden grandiosity "
2900,isfp,"Hmm i dont really get manic phases like that where i feel like im at the top of the world or super hot shit.. But i do have a good amount of vanity all the time and sometimes i feel like i know better than other people at certain things. Im also quick to judge certain behaviors although i try not to. Its like theres two side of me most times. One side that feels like theyre super unique and amazing and another side that thinks theyre basically dumb and nothing and unspecial. I have one side that likes to judge and classify people and see ulterior motives in people and one side that likes to see every one as awesome and smart with good intentions. 
I think i confuse myself and worry that anything good i think about myself is a grandiose idea of myself. Then i worry that this level of perfectionism and self absorption is indicative of narcissism. Maybe im just in an overthinking mood."
2901,isfp,"I definitely relate to this, but I try to remind myself that it's really just self-confidence, and that's healthy! I don't think I'm the best thing since sliced bread, but if I didn't recognize my own talents and uniqueness, I would be delusional to the other extreme,and would be doing myself a great disservice. It does feel sometimes like a tightrope to be accurately confident, especially when you think about the many other people's expectations. That's why it's best to just not think about that, and accept yourself for who you are. Easier said than done, and takes continual effort. "
2902,isfp,"Haha. Yeah. This sort of dismissive reaction is exactly why I dont broadcast this stuff in real life, or even on here for that matter. But you asked, and here's my answer. I am better then everyone else, including you."
2903,isfp,"I picked up on that. And if I was your equal I would have laughed along. But since I am superior to you I will not tolerate even vaguely patronizing comments, or people who do not respect the gravity of my superiority."
2904,isfp,Definitely super outgoing with people I‚Äôm comfortable with. I can be. Plus my anxiety makes me seem really outgoing as I talk really fast and have high energy when I‚Äôm anxious. But I always have to recharge and need a lot of alone time. 
2905,isfp,"Hello guys, 
It is my first post and writing mistakes may be made since English is not my native language ( sorry about that) 
I'm 24 years old , and I've discovered my type one year ago and since then I've been confused. I have a personal history regarding changing degree that I'm not proud of , I've been changing my decision about careers about 4 times already. I went from agriculture, sociology , psychology , marketing , business and now i'm studying management in college. I also work part time at a company who produces and sells aquariums and I have a good professional relationship with my boss. He says he wants me to be the future manager there when I will finish my business degree.
I am not sure if that is what I want to do , I've completed  rigurous aptitude tests, and the results where that I have very good visual spatial skills and very good analitycal thinking, and that I might be good at engineering. In school I've always liked science, and I have been passionate about aquariums. Now I don't have any passion, I am super confused , I feel stuck , I have no motivation to continue , because I feel that maybe I am missing something better. Also , I've read that ISFP's have trouble finishing their studies , and I am worried that with my indecision I might remain without any type of higher education and then I will regret it. Lately I had obsesive thoughts about this problem.
Any advice ? How do you guys made a decision about your career path ? 
‚Äã"
2906,isfp,"I took the things that I liked. Biology and helping people and got a career that suited those. It was not easy though. I failed two years and ended up taking longer than expected to finish. But I must say I am glad my parents pushed me to see it through. There were times I didnt want to carry on. Now I am qualified and my work only gets better. Yes I have bad days, weeks. But the ultimate goal/feeling is the same. 
I would advise you to try and push to finish. Ive seen so many people start and stop studies to many times, and after a while they dont have anything. "
2907,isfp,"Hey, I want to thank you for sharing this. I'm currently stressed and failing a lot and it seems my degree is even more far away from me now. 
It's hard because I compare my work to others and I get the impression that I'm slow. 
I dream of the day that I finish this, lol."
2908,isfp,"I don't think you're going to find any true correlation primarily because our full zodiac profiles are entirely unique, based on exact time and location of birth (though my full profile falls completely short beyond my moon and rising signs).  I'm not saying zodiac is bullshit at all, but that theory doesn't draw the high T types that mbti/Jungian theory does so the more detailed descriptions are not only lacking but way off base. "
2909,isfp,Well thank you for that insight. I was more interested in the elemental factor. Like for example are water types more likely to be ISFP‚Äôs or is fire? I wasn‚Äôt trying to draw a comparison in what traits they test just a general curiosity more than anything. 
2910,isfp,"Ive read isfp descriptions that say we are into clothes and style. Are you? What are some of your favorite clothes right now? Whats your style like?
Im kinda into clothes. I like looking a little scrappy. I like hippy stuff but not in your face hippy stuff. My favorite clothes are my kikkoman soysauce t shirt and my denim joggers. Hbu?"
2911,isfp,"Yep. I wear lolita fashion with colorful and bright patterns, it makes me feel like my best self. 
If I have a lazy day I might prefer to wear a tshirt of my favorite fandoms. 
I cant stand others trying to choose clothes for me especially if those clothes are mature and athletic. I must choose them myself, I have very specific and sensitive tastes in things like clothes and art. 
A few years ago though I didnt give a shit about clothes and just let my mom choose them for me. Now I have some new ones they made me realized how meeeeeh those old ones were"
2912,isfp,"May I politely and unjudgingly ask how many here are positively inclined towards the hippy lifestyle and/or would like to test it. 
Also who draws inspiration in clothing from this movement?
I'm asking because one if the things that was repeatedly mentioned in type descriptions I have read was that were I to imagine an ISFP I just have to imagine Hippies.
My mom and an ex are ISFP and both of them are in some form of fashion intrigued by it."
2913,isfp,Yesss I live for dressing up to just make myself feel fabulous! I can mix and match anything and make it my own. Lately it's been more edgy and all black. I am also into shirts with a choker and deep v :)
2914,isfp,"Yes! I love winter clothes, specially my gabardine, white wool jersey and scarf. 
Also, I don't know if it's considered clothing, but I always make a topknot in my hair, and let two hair wicks free, anime style."
2915,isfp,Thinking about clothes (and designing some of them in my head) is pretty fun. I like jeans with pretty much everything. One of my favorite attires is jeans with a black skin-tight lace shirt and black ankle boots. I'd wear them everywhere. I also like my lavender v-neck shirt and purple knee-length pants for casual attire. 
2916,isfp,"Given the choice, I'd wear clothes to express my ideal identity. With lack of options/money, I tend to take what I can get that most appeals to me and that kinda becomes my temporary identity. The clothes I wear definitely affect my mood and self-perception.
For my ideal identity, I imagine myself as I would appear as a cartoon character (my friends have literally compared me to a cartoon haha). Kinda what it would look like is a red hoodie/jacket, yellow polo shirt, blue/grey jeans, and whatever colour sneakers I feel like at the time. Sunglasses too if I want to feel extra cool B^J"
2917,isfp,"I like some hippy elements in clothes but i dont go overboard with it. I like crystals and incense but i dont  buy into the idea that they have any healing properties. I just like pretty rocks every now and then. That's as hippy ish as i get. I wouldnt really describe myself as a ""hippy""."
2918,isfp,"Did any of you guys watch the premier of Cosmos: A Space Odyssey? It was downright gorgeous! I couldn't help but grin at some of the scenes during the show. It was also a great learning experience and I can't wait to see how it goes from there. 
Here's a link to the trailer, in case you haven't seen it. It's been a while since I've watched a show this visually stunning. I am definitely watching it every weekend until it ends!"
2919,isfp,"they are nice and mentally stimulating, also warm and talkative without loosing their individuality. they're the only extroverts with whom i can watch a lot of series during a lot of time, even fights are fun and entertained. rainbows flow everywhere."
2920,isfp,"I get along with them pretty dang well. Lots of ENFP friends. Over time I usually find them less attractive, because a lot of times it feels like they're obsessed with themselves and most of the time we spend is me listening to stories about their personal lives. Which is fine, it's just not as interesting.
To be fair, I'm in college, so like everyone is obsessed with themselves."
2921,isfp,My best friend is an ISFP (I‚Äôm an ENFP) and we vibe so so well. My ex boyfriend was also an ISFP and we both very much were attracted to each other and enjoyed being around each other. Oh and my sister is also an ISFP. I love ISFP‚Äôs ^_^
2922,isfp,"lol from now on start doing it, if you don't ask, the answer will always be no. if you don't take steps, you will always be in the same place.  just don't be afraid of rejection, because is the 99% of the life."
2923,isfp,"Happiness is your dog silently cuddling next to you in the first hours of the morning; it's your mom cooking your favourite dish when you had a rough day; it's the breeze in your hair when chilling on the balcony. Happiness is finally recognizing all your achievements; it's knowing that if anything fails, you can count on yourself. Happiness is slacking on a day off, it's seeing a flower on that cactus you bought that miraculously didn't die like all the other plants. Happiness is being alive, being part of the amazing wonders of the universe. It's having a supportive partner; it's crying in awe at northern lights; it's finding that beautiful colorful cheap bra.
I can't even imagine not being able to find happiness around me.
To quote Wordsworth: 
""My heart leaps up/
When I behold/
A rainbow in the sky;/
So was it when I was a child/
So it is now I am a man/
So be it when I shall grow old/
Or let me die!"""
2924,isfp,"Hapiness is not having to dread the next morning because you have your alarm clock set so you'll be on time for you shitty job that you hate... when you find something that you like doing that fulfils you and can make a living off I think you can be truly happy. It's not the only thing needed for happiness but it's a big part. I'm almost truly happy, although not unhappy 
Also a Land Rover Defender 110 would make me super happy "
2925,isfp,"Something in a box. Kittens, french fries, paint supplies, a brand spanking new keyboard-or anything new, really. Your old letters to your favorite significant other that you're no longer with but hold sweet memories with. The tee shirts and old jeans that you've stopped wearing and are dropping off to donate at the thrift shop-that feeling of freeing yourself from excess junk that you no longer need. Chocolates. Some of your toys that you just found in your mom's attic that you thought were lost in that last move. A ring bought with the best of intentions. "
2926,isfp,"I went from high school‚Äôs ‚ÄúI want to be popular and have a lot of friends‚Äù to ‚Äúwe have this in common, let‚Äôs be friends(even though you have just scratched surface level to friendship)‚Äù. Now, I have shifted to ‚Äúokay. Maybe we have a slight possibility of being friends, but here are the prerequisites‚Äù.
I‚Äôm picky with who I let in now, which leads me to living a pretty solitary life. A happy solitary life, at that.
Any other ISFPs?"
2927,isfp,"I think like most ISFP we have lots of friendly acquaintances but very few people that resonate with us on a deep level. Other than a significant other I find that most of my relationships come and go as I get older. I have maybe one or two friends that I can connect with past surface level.
I do have some childhood friends that I haven't seen in years but know that we would reconnect instantly if we run into each other. "
2928,isfp,"i‚Äôm still in the ‚ÄúI want to be friends with 89% of people who like the same things I do‚Äù stage. (until they say something that bothers me and I begin avoiding them)
With dating, on the other hand... I‚Äôve gotten extremely picky.
I went from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, I just want a boyfriend for the sake of having one‚Äù to ‚Äúthis dude doesn‚Äôt appreciate my shit humor at all, and he doesn‚Äôt know how to have a real conversation... oof, dear God,  if you‚Äôre out there,  please make him stop talking to me because I‚Äôd rather die alone.‚Äù
I‚Äôm definitely more okay with being (mostly) friendless than when I was as a teenager. I recently made a new friend from school and I never thought I‚Äôd see the day."
2929,isfp,I don't even know if it's being picky. People want their friends' to have common interests. Just like how people want their romantic partner to be attractive. It's not shallow. It's normal and perfectly reasonable. 
2930,isfp,"Those aren't feelings, those are emotions. Feelings are always tied to an object, emotions are more of a mood, which may lead you to complain about nothing.
Everyone can relate to being in a bad mood, even if they may not want to. Schedule a day with a friend, it can help in amazing ways."
2931,isfp,"Why be sad about that?
Would you rather be in a (semi forced) relation with a, basically, witch / hag? Or just waste time besides someone you don't care about?
There's absolutely nothing you're missing. And the happiness will come, often out of the blue."
2932,isfp,"INFJ rant ahead.
My S.O when he has some serious worries, is becoming very secretive. As an intuitive, i just feel it from miles away, my gut never betrayed me. Last time, about a week ago, I asked him politely if everything was alright and he said that there is no reason for me to ask this question, that everything was alright and that ""it is just  your feeling"". As the INFJ that I am, it made me question what im basing this feeling on. I tried really hard to make myself believe that there is no logical reason to feel that way. See the contradiction. I was trying to reason my gut feeling. While i tried to make myself feel better about it and believe the ISFP, the feeling would not go away. Today, I again politely asked him if there was anything wrong with him and if  there is, if he could share it. He confess that there is something going on and that he wants to keep it for himself. One thing is his privacy and I get it, because I need it too. But this made me feel betrayed. He made me question myself, doubt my gut feeling, when in fact it was right from the start. It drove me furious and in a controlled way, I let it out. It is shredding my trust for him and his credibility and this is a critical thing for me (and INFJ in general). It is not the first time and it ends up in his apologies and then in phrases that go like ""I did not mean to..."", ""I thought  you would not ask me again that question.."", or ""I did not think you would take it that way.."". It is becoming utterly disappointing and there is nothing I can do to stop this feeling. I love him, but I dont know how much longer I can keep up with it.  Any comment is more than welcome."
2933,isfp,"i know personally when people ask how i am doing or if anything is wrong, i pretty much always say i'm ok; no matter how close to the person i am or not. part of it is because i don't like to show my ""weak side"" because i'm generally a positive and happy person & i don't want to worry people. but honestly, most of the time i don't share what/how i'm feeling until i feel ready to share. even if i may want to share what's going on that doesn't always mean i'm ready. and for me it takes a long time to feel that way and also process just.. everything. sometimes even - when i come to terms with whatever's happening, in the end i may decide not to share what's going on after all. because i'll decide it just doesn't matter anymore or doesn't help to share, and that's ok. 
i actually feel really happy when people constantly check up on me even though i may find it annoying at times, but it shows they care; as long as it's genuine, which i'm sure you are being. so i would say keep asking once in a while, just so they know you care. it helps a lot even though it may not seem like you're doing much. 
but yeah, not sure if your s.o feels the same as me, but hope this helps. in my experience it's nothing about not trusting someone, privacy, or anything like that. it's just how i feel and what i decide is best for me even if the other person might not understand. "
2934,isfp,"I can't speak for your S. O., only for myself.  When I have issues or problems that I see have no solution I don't like to share them.  It makes me feel like I'm just giving my loved ones more things to worry about,  and since I don't see the answer it's like giving someone a puzzle with pieces missing.  In other words it feels cruel,  like I'm tormenting them with my issues.  This may be what your S. O. is feeling,  but I can't say for sure. "
2935,isfp,"I understand both of you.
But since I more than often did or would behave the same way here is my guess. Maybe he‚Äòs not sure about whatever is going on and before telling you about it he needs to sort his thoughts. Maybe he didn‚Äôt want to hurt you by telling you that there is something going on but not telling what since he first has to go through it alone and he didn‚Äòt want to burden you with it. At least that would be my approach and I understand why it upsets you... and I‚Äòm sure he does too! But in my opinion this is not about trust."
2936,isfp,"Always listen to your gut. Especially in relationships.
There's a difference between him having a minor thing that he's not ready to share yet, and a major thing that's he's being secretive about. I would think that now you know there is ""something"" whether it's minor or major that there's a timeline of sorts with him being communicative. Really all you can do express is that you've been picking up ""vibes"" from him, that you care for him, and you're open to talking about something when he's ready to share.
A ""penny for your thoughts"" type thing... 
The problem comes is when you can clearly sense it, they deny it, and you start questioning yourself. If it goes on long enough, I know I tend to start picking at that ""scab"" to get them to open up. If I suspect it's a relationship-threatening issue (cheating/lying) then I'll start digging to find out what's going on (hate that i do it but it is what it is) . When it comes to these larger cheating/betrayal issues, My gut has NEVER been wrong. 
but, yeah, huge difference between a minor issue that he's trying to sort out in his head or something much much larger. "
2937,isfp,"Thank you so much for your reply. Reading your explanation is very much resembling him. He said it at several occasions before, but this time he is a lot more..defensive and when i feel him like that it makes me want to have nothing to do with him. It makes me feel rejected. His privacy I never attempted to invade it, and i respect his personal boundaries. I dont really care that he does not want to tell me (I do, because I would have probably just listened, to empathise). What bothered me is the fact that ..he tried to undermine my emotion, like it is just in my imagination, it is not real.I have spent the entire week questioning why i feel that way, if it is something im making up...basically the full introspection and emotional homework. This is what hurt the most. I understand in time that he is horrible at putting himself in my position and projecting himself in how I would feel in a certain situation. It is frustrating seeing him sulk and pretend that he is okay, yet denying it and making me feel ridiculous for even questioning. That is what is hard to let slide, you know? People complain that no one cares about them genuinely, but i feel that maybe i care too much and maybe I should not. It sucks. Be it as it may, your reply is a bit calming, even if i dont know how I would forgive this attitude from him. "
2938,isfp,"yeah no problem! i understand why you would feel that way. i think it's actually a good thing that you ""care too much"", some people don't care enough. you should embrace that! 
i'm sorry and i know you didn't ask, but from my point of view it seems he must be having a really rough time right now, seeming that he undermines your emotions and is more defensive than usual. that's really tough. don't know what's going on, but i do know when i've been like that in the past it's hard to get myself out of that habit/mindset(?). it does make me feel really awful too because i really don't mean it. and i know it's no excuse, but for me it really is just all my overwhelming emotions. but like i said, it's ultimately up to him with how he wants to deal with things. just remember though that your feelings are very much valid too and sometimes it's ok and good to be selfish. trust your gut :) wish you both the best!"
2939,isfp,"Honestly, introspect a little and think about what would make the situation better. Think about past experiences and how you can make them better. When it comes to being more talkative and more open, it really varies from person to person. But, I can tell you what‚Äôs been working for me.
I used to always beat myself up for not being social. I would go to groups and force myself to go to social gatherings I didn‚Äôt want to go to. And honestly... it was awful. I didn‚Äôt make new friends. I just became more reserved and miserable.
Then, after one very bad interaction, I was like ‚Äúscrew it‚ÄîI‚Äôm not gonna socialize anymore.‚Äù That was also pretty bad, because no matter how introverted you are, you still need people to some extent.
So, I came to this middle ground: when I go out and do social things, I‚Äôm going to have them be things I enjoy. That way, if I don‚Äôt make friends or open up to anyone, I‚Äôll still have a good time. And if I do, it‚Äôll be easier to meet then, because of shared interest.
That‚Äôs what worked for me, but something else could work for you. Good luck!"
2940,isfp,Its fucking impossible for me to meet new people unless its forced upon me. Its not that I can't. I just won't. Though when I go to my local gaming store I have a steel pair of balls and will challenge any one to a game of Magic the Gathering and talk about the game relentlessly. Its like when I walk through those doors my I turns to an E. Magic has helped me make tremendous strides in my inability to talk to strangers. Dare I say I'm popular there. Find something you like doing. The conversation with strangers should come naturally. Hopefully they will do you the service of initiating contact first too.
2941,isfp,"You sound more like an INFP. In that case, good luck. 
If you‚Äôre truly an ISFP, go travel. Seek out a new culture. You won‚Äôt have to open up people, they will instinctively come to you (us). 
I travel alone abroad and don‚Äôt open up anyone, and they just want to talk to me (ISFP). America is a bad place for ISFPs. Europeans love us. We have good taste and are independent. "
2942,isfp,"Hellooooo!
I'm an infj and this sub's been a little calm these days, so I figured I'd get around to asking some questions about you guys I've always wondered. I'd appreciate any response, Happy Tuesday! 
1) What do you normally think about/wonder (/when you're alone, if they differ)?
2) Do you enjoy taking yourself out on dates/doing things alone, or is it hard to enjoy because you'd rather experience things with others?
3) How do you reward yourself?
4) What are your guilty pleasures?
5) What/Are there things/habits you've always wanted to do, but haven't? Why?"
2943,isfp,"1) People, myself. When I'm alone my thoughts are more free and less depressive
2) Mmm it depends. To an amusement park or movies I'd rather go with friends or family for example, going to some random place by myself is fun. And I prefer doing things by myself at home usually. 
3) With naps, alone time, sweet food. 
4) Obsessing over colours (and their meaning in my life) 
5) Mmh I've always wanted to be organized and super productive. For me that still remains a dream though hahaha;;; (i'm scattered as hell)"
2944,isfp,"1) i normally think about historical people, that there is no point to life, about dinosaurs, outer space and if there are life forms on it, about mbti/enneagrams, about other people's types, about work etc. 
2) i like doing things with others but i'm usu self sufficient and independent so i would say depending on what kind of situation and activity.
3) By eating/ buying materialistic items
4) Fast food is one of them.
5) I've always wanted to be more organized and on time but clearing it's working the opposite lol. I need to stop on procrastination which is my biggest downfall "
2945,isfp,"1) it‚Äôs really random. After work I could be thinking about work and co workers or friends. I could stress about school. Or I can stumble upon traveling videos on YouTube and envision my future self traveling the world. 
2) I love taking myself out on dates alone. I‚Äôm 21 and sometimes I just don‚Äôt have anyone to go on little adventures with me, but I don‚Äôt let that stop me. I have a lot of fun regardless. 
3) I can reward myself by planning a fun weekend with friends. We‚Äôll go out to bars or festivals/concerts. Or even just travel around the state. If it‚Äôs a small reward maybe I‚Äôll buy myself clothes or good food lol. 
4) guilty pleasure would be smoking weed at night lol. I know it‚Äôs not the healthiest thing to do but sometimes after a long day of work or school nothing beats smoking a bowl and chilling out watching the office until I fall asleep. Either Netflix or listen to music till I fall asleep. I want to buy a good vape so It‚Äôll be a lot smoother on my lungs. Idk Sometimes I can smoke weed every other night for a month, and then the next month not touch it at all. It varies
5) so I keep wanting to join a rock climbing gym and eventually go out to real rock climbing destinations with people. I don‚Äôt join now because it‚Äôs a little pricey and I‚Äôm a broke college student. I also would like to learn to surf but I dont have that much free time other than a Saturday morning but I‚Äôm usually lazy and like to sleep in. "
2946,isfp,"1) I feel like I am always thinking but rarely remember what I thought about later in the day or if asked. **EDIT
2)I love taking myself out on dates. I will take myself to a fancy restaurant for a steak, wine and a Manhattan with desert. But most often my dates (alone) are long drives through mountain passes to remote towns where I walk around and go on short hikes to local sights (hot springs, lakes, interesting trees ect.)
But I also enjoy doing these things with others if they will appreciate it
3) I typically reward myself by sleeping in/taking a nap or buying a more expensive bottle of scotch.
4) Staying up late eating pizza hut stuffed crust pizza and playing video games with my roommates from college and drinking PBR.
5) I really want to hike the three major long distance trails in America. Particularly the Appalachian Trail. I haven't because I'm lazy, poor, and the timing has worked out because of work opportunities and getting married (soon). I think I will be able to in the future so long as my wife will be okay with me dipping out for 4-5 months. 
 EDITED FROM**I actually have noticed recently I don't think/wonder all that much. (in honesty I probably do and I'm just being self aware at this point in life) If I do its about what ever is happening immediately around me and typically in nature/while reading. "
2947,isfp,I dont think i ever felt sorry for me being irresponsible cuz since i chose this path i cant say anything or i dont deserve any pity for myself. But ive been looking at what im spending recently and trying not to over indulge. Hope to do something about my self control before it goes to a point of no return. 
2948,isfp,"1) I love to think about complexity of life, how everything is created in such a perfect way; or relationships woman-man, mother-child, etc..
2) I love going out with friends, also I enjoy being on my own. I have just started to go out on my own :))
3) With a tv series or a coffee if I go outside
4) Pizza and fast food
5) Using my time efficiently 
what about you?"
2949,isfp,"Usually when I‚Äôm with people I‚Äôll think about them and my relation to them and how im coming across. Or just focused on what we‚Äôre doing with eachother.  When im by myself i usually just try to keep busy or listen to music, watch tv, go on my laptop, etc.  Because if i spend too much time alone, i can get really depressed and start overanalyzing my life and think about why something bad happened, or worry about shit lol
Not a fan of first dates, but if i know someone and like them, i love to be around them.. for like a day or two, and then i need my space again
I buy things haha
I still play pokemon and can get pretty addicted
I‚Äôd like to learn bass and how to cook and bake better meals"
2950,isfp,"

Really depends. It can be about people or complex topics.


Depends on the place. Somewhere quiet, relaxing and not far away would be alright to go alone. 
If it's more expensive like seeing a movie or amusement park, I want someone with me.


gaming, science, relaxing, and often Music. 


Definitely music. Some genres across the electronic spectrum i'm a little embarrassed to listen to, but still absolutely love it. I'm very personal about my tastes in music and can even get defensive about it. 


Usually i can do most things i set my mind to, but things i haven't done that I've always wanted to? maybe travelling... I've thought about it a few times and don't usually get around much since I like to stay inside most of the time, but I've always been a little curious about the world outside my reach. Like, I've always wanted to see what Japan is like, or South Korea. I'd love to learn more about their culture and see what they consider important, not important, and just how much it differs. The only reason i haven't done it is probably because i'm too young to do that myself, and I doubt anyone in my family would consider taking me to do that. 


Hope i'm not too late for this thread"
2951,isfp,"1) Very interesting, I only ever think about other people, I'm realizing. 
5) Being productive is hard! It's a muscle though, so it can't happen overnight. You gotta start with doing things that make you feel good/value yourself more (keeping your room clean for quick and instant highs, going to the gym/physical activity is tough at first but you never regret after and you develop more self respect in the long-term, and eliminating anything that makes you feel the opposite --- Ex. for me, food was too good, but I'd get upset with myself for spending too much money or feel physically/figuratively unhealthy after --- budgeting/not having to worry about money is very important for me, using your money for things you won't end up regretting --- Tiny things that overall contribute to having a sense of control around your life will go a long way)"
2952,isfp,"4) Haha yeah, the last statement is wayyy too relatable. 
5) I've been thinking about that, too! I'd say get a friend and just go for it, even if you can't commit yet. Maybe try skipping out on spending any money on food/weed the next week or two, with that in mind. "
2953,isfp,"1) I'm always wondering! I lead with Ni/Introverted Intuition, so I'm constantly trying to figure out the way the world works. I hang out with friends and then hide away until I dissect everything they said, to figure out what they meant, how they work, and who they are. Then, with all the new information, I appreciate them and wonder more about them and ask them to hang out and ask them more questions. I do this mostly to figure myself out, but it helps me learn about others, too. 
2) I feel like sensing types are usually a little bit reluctant to enjoy themselves on their own, glad to hear you've been having fun! I feel like I could wonder and think by myself my whole life and be perfectly fine --- I love doing things alone or including anyone that wants to 'experience' whatever together, rather than 'do', because experience gives me more perspective/questions.
3) I'm extremely productive and try to make sure I make time for my friends, so I reward myself with alone time only after taking care of everything.
4) I'm the fatttttttttest little kid at heart, I usually drool thinking about the food on my way there. 
5) Being in the moment, which is why I love you ISFPs! No expectations, just chilling, enjoying things. I took a lesson from you guys and started doing instead of overthinking and it's helped a lot, but it's still tough for me to be fully there. "
2954,isfp,"I dont know how i developed but even if i try anything, routine always gets me down and i never manage much. I cant stand it. I dont know if im always in an Se mood or something when i spend i know what are the consequences but i still do it. Guess it's called living in the moment for me. "
2955,isfp,"I didn't even know what Se was until a few months ago. I spent almost half my life just over thinking and missing out on things, even though I knew it was bad too. At least you probably got some cool experiences out of it, I passed on literally all of them but I guess that was living in the moment for me. 
I hear you though, it took me about 7 solid months of intense and complete effort to change the way I'd been/thought all my life. Recognizing that there will be consequences while still doing it anyway is huge though, it's all about baby steps. For a while, I just surfed r/getdisciplined r/personalfinance and others like it before even making any changes; if you're already browsing this sub, try spending at least a few minutes a day browsing whatever catches your eye and I'm sure your thinking might start to shift a little. Then you could start with some tiny habits to get you started. It took months before I could do basic things without it feeling like a drag because I would get distracted too, but you start with small ones so that you can at least finish them pretty quickly whenever you remember/decide to get back on it. 
Just like finding your MBTI sub, it's nice knowing everyone else has the same problems with routine and money and life in general with those other subs. Also, try to notice if you ever find yourself feeling sorry for yourself for being so irresponsible--- that's what I meant about noticing your thoughts being huge, try to catch them when they start to make you feel bad. Your brain is getting mad that you're not perfect, it's expecting too much out of you. Let yourself know that you just aren't that person yet and it cant happen overnight. Remind yourself that you at least tried (badly) and that really counts because it's more than before, maybe next time you'll get it done, or maybe you'll wanna try again right now! Hope you find your groove."
2956,isfp,"I feel smart. But then, who does not ? Is there anyone who doesn't think he's smarter than most, than common people ?
I used to think about this sometime, but it's hard to find objective answer. You must also take into an account the fact that there are more types of intelligence."
2957,isfp,"I think I'm decently smart, I guess. I don't know for sure though, because at this point the only definition of smart I've been able to get has been force fed to me by the school system. 
I'm definitely not smart in social situations, lol. Either that or I think I'm less good at that stuff than I am. Same thing really. Pretty smart with logical things and creativity. Not so much with explaining what I'm thinking properly.
It's hit and miss for most people though, (unless you're like a prodigy at everything in which case good for you) some areas we're smart and some we aren't. The good news is it's possible to get better in all of them, it just takes practice."
2958,isfp,"I used to and still tend to think that I'm not really all that smart. And then I talk to my friends younger brother and his friends (about 22 years old, highschool dropouts) and they make me feel smart. I once used a work (i cant remember which one) that had multiple syllables and it blew their minds. They were like ""you are so smart, what does that even mean?"" The word was something along the lines of ""hyperbole""  or something that is in most adults vocabularies. Its memories like these that make me think I might be smart. (despite having to try to spell syllable more than once to get it right)"
2959,isfp,"Another response, more on topic to what you said. I have a hard time communicating my thoughts verbally to certain people (my boss or my fiancee) Unless it is something I feel like I am the ""expert"" on or something that I am really passionate about. It does make me feel somewhat not smart in a sense. Its a hard thing to overcome at times."
2960,isfp,"I guess I consider myself above avg. If that makes sense. I have a university degree but I do not always express my thoughts well, dont think you need to be able to express your thoughts to be smart. Some people talk very well but share no actual information. 
The people I work with think I'm an infinite source of information which is probably due to my family having this strange way of sharing any information acquired. So I have this very wide range of stuff I know bits about.
But then when I am around my friends from university I do not feel very smart as they studied Medicine and are now Dr where I'm but a mere physiotherapist."
2961,isfp,"in socionics the J means that you first function is a Judger function (F, T), and the P means your first function is a Perceiver function (N, S). In MBTI it's the first extroverted function that matters. Ours is Se, therefore is our first extroverted function, so we are Ps. Hope I explained it right to understand"
2962,isfp,"Identical relationships are difficult, since you can't really help each other out. I saw a marriage survey somewhere and same type marriages were at the very bottom, next were marriages with same dominant function like INTJ-INFJ. Here are the suggested type matches for ISFPs that are more balanced: MBTI types in relationships with ISFPs."
2963,isfp,"It just dawned on me that tommorw is my birthday. I'll be 22 years old. I've also realized that I've accomplished nothing in my life--It's been over three years since I graduated from high school, three since I started community college, and I'm nowhere near close to earning a degree, heck, I don't even know what career to choose. Everything I like is considered useless, such as art, forgein languages, and music. I gave up everything I liked in high school in order to please my teacher who wanted me to focus on science and AP English classes. I now suck at art, I've given up on music, and I haven't studied a forgein language since the age of 16. At this point in my life I feel too old to go back to the things I loved. I've thought about majoring in art history but I think I'm too stupid to get an art history degree. I've thought about getting a ""paralegal studies"" degree, but again, I think I'm too stupid to even do that. I'm currently trying to earn a ""general studies"" Associate's degree from my community college. 
I just fear that I won't accomplish anything in my life. I just feel dumb compared to most people. "
2964,isfp,"Hey mate, keep your chin up. I'm 41 years old and I still don't know what I want to do when I grow up. (o_o)
After I graduated high school I skipped college and spent the next 12 years of my life working at a company that didn't really suite my interests, but it paid the bills. In spite of that I still learned a lot and looking back it really helped me to develop skills that I've been able to carry with me through life.
One day I finally woke up and decided I couldn't take it anymore, took initiative to change, and started working for a company more in line with my interests. (I've been a graphic designer for the last 13 years.) Even now, I still feel like it's not where I ultimately want to be or do with my life. Don't get me wrong. I've learned a WHOLE LOT from both jobs and there's definitely merit to getting out there and working regardless of whether or not you feel it's your life's calling.
Heck, I wish I was in your position. You're 19 years younger than I am and you're actually hitting the ""what am I doing with my life"" stage early. It wasn't until I was 28 before I started doing that. Even then, I didn't seriously consider that I needed to start pursuing my interests and becoming skilled at something I really enjoyed. This is something that I wish I had learned when I was your age.
There's a quote from Bob Ross that really hits home to me. He said, ""Talent is a pursued interest. In other words, anything that you're willing to practice, you can do"". That's a powerful concept to understand. Sure there are a few rare savants out there in the world who magically are able to pick up a paint brush and paint a masterpiece or pick up clay and sculpt something awesome or pick up a pen and write a bestseller or pick up a Wall Street Journal and make investments that really pay off, etc. etc. You get the idea. For the rest of us, it's all a matter of taking the time to learn and practice until we are true artists in whatever we decide to pursue.
Don't get down on yourself. Stay positive. Trust me, I know it's easier said then done. (I've struggled quite a bit with crippling depression personally.) Just remember that you're ultimately in control of and responsible for your own happiness. If you need help in jump-starting your happiness, perhaps volunteer somewhere or just do something nice for someone. There have been several times in my life where I lost touch of what happiness is supposed to feel like. Making others smile is a great way to find your way back.
This might sound weird, but not being happy with where you're at in life can be a good thing. Get angry about it and use that anger to propel yourself toward happiness. (I told you it would sound weird.) As soon as you realize that you deserve to be happy you can start the process of discovering what makes you happy. Once you figure that out just keep on keeping on. (Man, I sound like a cheesy motivational speaker.)
I wish I knew the right words to say that you need to hear at this point in time. Just know that you're not alone, you're not a failure, and there's a purpose for your life that only you can fulfill. You can do it!!
By the way, I hope you don't get depressed knowing that I'm 19 years older than you and still don't know what I want to do. I'm not upset about it. I'm excited for what life has in store for me. Don't think that you have to have everything figured out by a certain age. Yes, it does make things a bit easier if you do discover your passion earlier on, but you're never to old to follow your passion.
Sorry for rambling soo much. Just know you're not alone and you're worth a lot!"
2965,isfp,"Let me tell you first: everyone feels useless sometimes. The super successful med student with a gazillion hours of volunteer service probably is having an anxiety attack when nobody's looking. Everyone is lost but pretending they have it all figured out. 
With that out of the way... Study art!! Or music!!! Or whatever you want!!! I knew art wasn't going to result in a real career for me but giving it up felt like ripping off a limb, so I compromised and got a minor in studio art. It was like a third of the classes of a major and it fit comfortably in my schedule--I only extended my education for a summer. It also lowered the expectations a little: sure, I was still around art students and around that environment that I loved so much but because it wasn't my main focus I was allowed to suck. 
It got to the point where I knew I wanted to minor in art-- but I had no idea what I wanted to do as a major. I explored a little and thought back on what I was good at and what my values were and settled first for public health, which led me to medicine. This has led me to a really rewarding job working for an arts program that focuses on kids of low socioeconomic status--which I wouldn't have gotten if it were not for my background in art. I even get to lead class an an instructor sometimes which is so much fun!!! 
Now for concrete advice which helped me choose the path I'm in right now: go to your school's career center and tell them what you just told us. They're are really nice and helpful at providing you with a little bit of guidance. They gave me personality tests (one of them MBTI) that highlighted my need to help others in a purposeful, immediate manner and my adrenaline junkie streak, which, turns out is a great fit for medicine. Volunteer. If there's something art-related say yes, even if you suck at it. I bet you're not even that bad!! Even if you're only a little bit interested... Say yes!! Who knows, it might be the thing you need to make a choice. Make connections, keep those professors you like close to you so you an pick their brains and use them as references for letters of recommendation and stuff. Some of my peers have gotten amazing jobs that way. 
Lastly, those careers are not about how intelligent you are, but about how much effort you put into them. The smartest people I know wasted their lives away because they didn't want to put in the effort. There's a limit in intelligence, but not in how many hours you put into your assignments to really understand the subject. "
2966,isfp,"Go back to your hobbies! Those are same of the same activities that I use to keep me sane through life and they're necessary. You're not too old to go back to them and with practice you will get back to where you once were. I'm like a year and a half older than you and I'm still picking up new hobbies that have branched out from music and art. Also, if you're feeling dumb, working on learning another language will make your brain start to run better. Just think of your brain like a muscle to be worked out, it can also lose strength if neglected in certain areas, but it can be regained.
A little trick for rediscovering yourself would be to try out a new area of those studies/hobbies, an area where you don't have any pre-conceived notions of how good you should be. If you played guitar, then try piano this time, or maybe something rhythmically-based like percussion. If you used to draw, then try painting, or charcoal drawing, or anything you haven't explored as a kid that you can now start fresh in as an adult.
Anyway, happy birthday! Don't worry too much about sorting out a long term plan while you're lost, just take things one day at a time and don't box yourself off from too many options. One more thing, what you take in school isn't as important as what you get experience in outside of school (in most cases). See if you can manage to get an internship in something interesting while you're in school or during your summers or something."
2967,isfp,"It's nice to know I'm not alone. I just see so many of my peers ""living life"", and here I am, stuck in my head, worried about things in my head. I'm jealous of people who go to nice colleges and universities, are able to get good grades, and still ""live in the moment"". I've always felt detached from my environment, just a silent observer of life. I try to run out of my head but I can't. It always manages to pull me back in. I often feel like a dying tree --people pass by me everyday, and no one cares about the pain I'm in. Life simply goes on; i feel my pain, but for everyone else my pain is just apart of the cycle of life. I'm so confused about my life, and what it means to the world. I'm not talking about what I mean to others, but the Earth itself. Is it disappointed that I'm wasting a life, a life that could have gone to another soul? 
‚Ä¢Sorry for the weird rant. "
2968,isfp,"Very observant of body language, tone, levels of communication that are more emotionally subtle that others may not notice. Emotionally intense but quiet about it. Go with the flow  but also individualistic. Kinda zen. Non confrontational but not wimpy."
2969,isfp,"Sensitive, puts a lot of thought into everything, social media and physical looks are curated. I have a deep appreciation for ISFPs that I don't think I can communicate.
Edit: Thought about this some more. I think my ISFP childhood best friend really sparked the creativity in me. We're activity relations and doing things with her really made me have fun with what was possible. Pretty priceless thing to give me."
2970,isfp,"For me... I have a sixth sense that tells me when people around me need to talk, help or have some problem going on.
I'm quite aloof and carefree, spontaneous, outgoing, arts and crafts lover, animal lover and travel addict.
I would say a defining trait is how difficult it can be to deal with our emotional stability, especially when things don't work well with the people we really care for. On the other hand, the willingness to sacrifice our own feelings for stability and less conflict, also defines who we are... although, I learned to not self-sacrifice myself to avoid conflict and would rather walk away."
2971,isfp,"Not super well-spoken unless we're in the zone or practice a lot. Fumbling over words, taking time to put a weird concept into concrete verbal communication. That's why I turn to art, especially music. Often a guitar riff could convey a feeling for me better than a phrase could."
2972,isfp,"I can enter and exit a room without being noticed aaaand there's also this thing about me being in this class or participating on an event but the professors can't seem to remember my name. Haha 
I guess this just goes with that 'isfp trait' of not being assuming, but also the fluctuating self-confidence."

2974,isfp,"Definitely. I was sort of dating an INTJ for a while, and we had a deep mutual understanding. I think that although we have such different roles in the world, we both take life seriously and live according to our own principles, without too much fanfare. "
2975,isfp,"I read in the sidebar that we have ""low levels of assertiveness"". I've always been very unasserive as a child and teenager, and I can totally see how this can be a common characteristic among us, but I feel like my assertiveness increases as I get older and become more at peace with myself. I used to feel the need to constantly ask for other peoples input in order to feel certain about things, but as I transit into adulthood I'm starting to feel like I'm even more in-tuned with what I believe in than most of my friends. I guess it comes down to having well-defined values, and an understanding of where they come from, which can be a very slow process. Being a man, I can definitely say that I am much more comfortable with expressing myself than most of my guy friends, which in itself is a form of assertiveness. It might not be the conventional form of assertiveness that comes with functions such as Te, but it's definitely a form of assertiveness. I don't think that we give ourselves enough credit in this regard."
2976,isfp,"As we get older, our lower functions begin to play a stronger role in our lives. By the time you reach 25, your Te will assert itself, and that makes you more assertive. We have to be careful, though, because we can become, not assertive, but aggressive (Se). What can happen is that we get into a pendulum mode, where we swing from passivity into aggression, which terrifies us, and we swing back too far into passivity again. I don't know how to suggest how to avoid that, except maybe to remember that you are still an introverted feeler, so let that rule, and don't neglect your sensing--get out and do things, don't sit at home, doing nothing, or get into a work-eat-sleep cycle, oh, and if you feel negativity starting to get a hold of you, that's the time you most need to get out and do something constructive. "
2977,isfp,"That happened to me too, because my high school friends were fucking idiots. Now, at the end of undergrad, I'm so far ahead of their game it's laughable."
2978,isfp,"It's not so much rehabilitating as it is simply getting out of our head and doing things. Like I said, do something constructive with you hands/body. Do something creative--and it doesn't have to be ""art"". Make a bird feeder, dig a hole. Ride your bike, or run or take a walk. Do something positive and creative... Don't know what else you would expect me to say."
2979,isfp,"The type is both of those things.
I find the creative thing really overblown.  ESFP, INFJ, ESFJ etc often seem to have a much higher creative output, not to mention society's overvaluation of status and wealth - things far easier to obtain if you pick a more traditional career.  Money's not that hard to get, but satisfaction is."
2980,isfp,"I personally feel I always have to put a cap on my slew of emotions, questions, and analyzing of situations because the ISTP in my life would rather shrug it off or grunt I don‚Äôt know than discuss feelings EVER. Our intimate life is amazing, possibly because I‚Äôve always been drawn to the mystery behind the man..but it‚Äôs also the very thing that will forever divide us. The more I ask, the more inclined they are to feel stuck and run away into their solitude. Any thoughts? "
2981,isfp,SAME my boyfriend is an istp and i often feel like he isn't listening to me and it's not that it's going over his head but he's trying to figure out the right response instead of just going with his heart/gut i guess. it's kinda like he's behind a wall. 
2982,isfp,"ISTP (female) here, head over to the ISTP sub and ask for some advice that way if you want. A lot of questions like that get asked so you might get a bit of a gruff response, but at least a few people should be helpful. Also, use the search bar as well, see if anything relevant comes up. Best of luck. "
2983,isfp,"So it's times like this that I wonder if I'm an INTP/ISTP instead of ISFP. For things like minimalism, exercise, sleep, personality type, I always seem to go on these research binges where I'll learn a whole bunch about a topic then whittle it down to what practically suits me best. I'm about to start this journey with food now. I see a lot of contradictory information and a lot of warning and caution on foods to eat, how to cook, what to cook in, etc, and it's all such a mess I can't just take anyone's word for it.
Is this Ti? Or is this: I'm about to gather a lot of Se data from Te sources and will hopefully Ni narrow it down to find what Fi suits me best. 
These information binges always confuse me regarding me type. The thing is I don't care so much about how the biology of all these minerals etc work, I trust the Te to tell me that, but I will take lots of sources and kind of average them out. If an issue is very popular (e.g. aluminium being toxic) and practical enough for me to adjust my lifestyle to, I'll trust it. But if there's only a few sources for it I'll just think it's some nutjob catastrophising shit and move on. Once I have a broad picture of all the stuff that people are saying, I will select what suits me practically, based on what I know I enjoy and wouldn't mind doing or can make something nice out of (even just getting new minimalist cookware which excites me). I know I already prefer healthy foods but it's also a source of stress because I don't want to put bad stuff in my body which is why I've been putting off learning about it.
However, like an ITP/IJ even, I have systems for everything, from the way my room is organised to the way I plan my week or deal with new information, although these things are usually very flexible and based on how I feel at the time. I try to discard anything I don't need straight away. My room never gets messy now, save for a few clothes when I'm distracted by my Ni world. It used to be a nightmare but it's taken years to whittle it all down to a system that ensures I never have to deal with P messes anymore and I can spend more time on what I really Fi value (like being out in nature, spending time with others, trying new things, etc)."
2984,isfp,"Generally, ISFPs are considered non-confrontational and laid back, but are there any personality types or characteristics of people that bring about confrontation on a regular basis?
For me, people who are not in positions of authority but act like it (try to tell me what to do) and hypocrisy, patronization, and people talking to me like I'm stupid when I'm trying to learn or understand something I haven't quite grasped. I can generally go around with just about anyone and many of my friends have polar opposite beliefs, thoughts, and ideas but I have a much harder time dealing with those things.
How about you guys? 
Edit:added characteristics"
2985,isfp,"""Alpha""/macho men. 
In my experience many of them are extremely unsure of themselves but hides this behind a rough exterior. They're pretty confused when they meet a balanced, calm, isfp male that doesn't buy into the whole male stereotype stupidity. "
2986,isfp,"I have a hard time dealing with people who are unnecessarily insulting.  Like those people that has to turn a conversation or a debate into something vitriolic.  I could see that falling into a lot of the things you mention since I tend to to find those kind of people patronizing and hypocritical.  I don't expect everyone to be a perfect angel but there's probably a better place and time for an angry rant.
I also have a hard time with anyone who sees things purely black and white...its not something I agree with most of the time."
2987,isfp,"I have the hardest time with older people who don't take me seriously because of my age. I work in a place that houses chronic alcoholics that have become homeless, and After four, there are only two staffed people in the building. There needs to be some sort of camaraderie or at least civility between coworkers, and one person I work with completely undermines everything I do because she's thirty years older than I am. She doesn't help me when residents get into fights, and she tries to correct everything I do, even thought I've been there at least six months longer than she has (the turnover rate for employees here is super ridiculous, so Even though it's not very long, it kind of is a long time, haha). She is the only person I've ever had a problem with in a work environment and it's soooooo frustrating. It's unnecessary nitpicking and just being rude. I don't like rude people. "
2988,isfp,"People who immediately assume control of a situation or task without fully understanding the circumstances. I feel like any form of impulsive leadership tends to make worse decisions that affect the future more than if they had just thought about how to solve it more efficiently. Also, these sort of people tend to never take back their decision, which I think is the worst part of all."
2989,isfp,"People with a superiority complex, who often ask themselves why everybody else is so stupid. They also tend to be very closeminded and in an argument act like their opinion is law and you're just a filthy plebeian who can't accept their hard ""truths"". They always rant about pop music and think people who enjoy going to clubs and watch reality TV are trash. 
So like at least 40% of Reddit pretty much."
2990,isfp,"People who are unrelenting and unnecessarily forward in expressing their opinions. These are usually the people who call me out for being too opinionated, but it's because I usually am the most stubborn with these people haha. Also, just overly loud or aggressive people in general. "

2992,isfp,"I am a student in college and this summer has been happy because I am not around thousands of other students and subconsciously comparing myself to them.
I want to continue to live my life story and stay focused on that. Do you have any tips for marching to the beat of your own drum and for noticing others less?  "
2993,isfp,"Yeah this is quite a tough one.. I would say do something different. Something that you would be proud of yourself for doing. I was an exchange student for a year and now I'm going into college knowing that I have some type of an upper hand. Cultural awareness, language skills, memories/experiences. People say to me ""wow that's really cool!"" and it makes me feel like I've accomplished a lot.
It's also good to remember that everyone else also compares themselves to each other. "
2994,isfp,"Get comfortable in your own skin, then others will stop mattering. Make sure you take care of yourself, maybe buy a lotion you really like the smell of or get a nice haircut or new clothes. That way you‚Äôll feel like the shit, making everyone else fade away a bit. "

2997,isfp,"It seems to be a trend that a lot of internet articles say isfps are bubbly??? But I thought you guys were a bit more laid back, kind of shy almost. I have seen some articles support the one stereotype and some support the other..."
2998,isfp,"I would never describe myself as bubbly, I am in fact more laid back and quiet. I‚Äôm not really shy, I was as a kid, but now I‚Äôm just quiet as I prefer to observe conversations than add. I‚Äôm more of a listener than a talker is what I‚Äôm trying to say. Sometimes I don‚Äôt say anything because I have no idea what to say. "
2999,isfp,"Naturally I'm a mix of both, it just depends on my surroundings. If I'm alone or in a really comfortable place I'm very chill and mellow but if something really excites me or I'm just in a really good mood I can be really bubbly and energetic."
3000,isfp,"I wouldn't really say I'm bubbly. Around people I don't know or like very much, I'm pretty withdrawn and/or tense. Around people I'm moderately okay with or close friends in a calm mood, I'm pretty laid back. The only time I might be described as bubbly is when I'm with friends and we're not just chilling or something, but then it's more like hyper than ""bubbly."" Think loud, obnoxious, making jokes (mostly puns tbh) every 5 seconds, etc.
EDIT: some phrasing."
3001,isfp,"I'm in my late twenties and work in PR/marketing. I must be getting soft in my old age or something lol  - I find that I go after feelers now.  ISFPs are so laid back and nice.  I like nice guys. 
the only place I have ever met ISFPs is though my friend who is really into the local music scene - I think some ISFPs are talented, tattooed musicians when they aren't at their day job"
3002,isfp,"Honestly? The internet.
I stay home a lot, aside from when I'm at work. Or I'll go to friend's houses. Occasionally bars. Sometimes I go shopping. I go to concerts. I'd like to go to the library more, but ebooks are making it easier to avoid. I'll sometimes go to or historic downtown district ""the square"" and just sit and people watch. Usually with friends, but I've gone there alone to read before.
Basically, I rarely go anywhere by myself unless it's shopping for necessities."
3003,isfp,"That's actually a good question! I'm an ISFP myself and I couldn't even tell you where I'm at. I guess if I could be somewhere, it would be a concert or Indian restaurant. But if I'm not at my house, I am on a walk, getting some essentials from the grocery store, or with a couple close mates. 
I realize that none of this is helpful to you, but it is what it is haha!
EDIT: Apparently this information is pretty universal among ISFPs... I didn't even read /u/Starburstnova's post before writing mine!"
3004,isfp,"Dear OP. I'm an INTJ. Fair warning, xSFP types can be difficult to understand and get along with.

3006,isfp,"Hey there, ISFPs.  
It‚Äôs recently come to light for me that along with INFP, ISFP seem to be another common mistype that follow along in INFJ descriptions (likely due to this ‚Äúintuitive bias‚Äù that can be seen around the community sometimes).  
I wonder, in what ways do you think yourself similar to INFJ?  In what important ways are you different?  How do you tend to see this intuitive bias?
Thanks in advance!"
3007,isfp,"Hello and welcome! (And thanks for asking!) 
I'm aware that there are some feelers that tend to mistype as INFJs quite often... I haven't typed myself as an INFJ, nor do I want to. I actually like being an ISFP, I just hate how our type is perceived by the MBTI community. I've recently seen a post (on Facebook) that describes ISFPs as being ""the black horse of MBTI"". I think it makes sense, honestly. We have dominant Fi (which everyone hates), and then we have PoLR Ne (which basically equals to us not being able to see multiple perspectives, in intuitives' eyes. which isn't true). If I expressed myself and my MBTI views, I feel like no one would believe me, just because how ingrained certain biases are in the community. 
That said, INFJ is apparently quite a popular type in the community... but I just can't see it for myself. To me INFJs just seem like more intuitive ISFJs, or more feely INTJs. That means, they can be plotting but also quite conscious of their image in the eyes of others. I'm not like that. (Quite honestly, I can see through it.) 
I'm similar to INFJs in the way that I may act nice and friendly when you first meet me but I am actually quite detached. I can relate to being a perfectionist (somewhat) and feeling socially isolated. I consider myself quite spiritual and can have some obsessions with metaphysical things... I like and appreciate beauty (well, I'm an ISFP, lol). I can space out quite a lot, too. I have a hard time making friends but good at keeping them, I guess. I can relate to ""knowing things"" out of nowhere. I usually require a lot of alone time. 
I don't absorb others' emotions easily, nor do I plan much. I'm less codependent and other people-focused. I don't struggle with physical things. I'm more ""present"". I'm not comfortable with giving emotional support/advice to people by talking. I'm more supportive by pointing out facts. I usually like to have an identity that I hold on to (for better or worse) and can have strong opinions. I like to do spontaneous things. I'm sensitive but I'm not good at showing my emotions outwardly."
3008,isfp,"We are both introverts. We both tend to like the same things, but for different reasons. For example, my husband and I are both Trekkies, but I like Star Trek because of the analogies and political relationships between the races, but he likes it for the space ships :) We are both artists, and to be frank, he‚Äôs a real artist, and I‚Äôm an impostor. ie: it comes naturally to him, and for me, it‚Äôs like pulling out teeth. We are both nice to people, but I really like people, and he doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm more extroverted than he is, even though we both need our space to recharge from social interaction. He‚Äôs sportier than I am. I‚Äôm not sporty at all. We‚Äôre both lazy, but just because he‚Äôs an Se user, he eventually gets more things done than me, in his own haphazard way. I‚Äôm the leader in the relationship. I almost always have a clear idea about where to go, what to do, what to eat -and he‚Äôs happy to go along with it. I like to tell Dad jokes, but he‚Äôs good at mimicking impressions from movie characters and stuff. I suck at it. And he hates Dad jokes.
But I suppose the biggest difference between us, is that I don‚Äôt mind doing things because I have to. I‚Äôll do something I hate, just because it‚Äôs my duty -but for him, that‚Äôs a huge turnoff. He‚Äôll probably do it if he has no other choice, but it bothers him a lot more than it does me. As for me, I feel proud of myself, because I ‚Äòdid the right thing.‚Äô
He can never get his head around that one :)"
3009,isfp,"Hmm... interesting perspective, I‚Äôll have to dig more into it!  It‚Äôs a bit of a shame how murky the real descriptions and nuances these types have become because of a slanted community; it starts to erode the otherwise insightful resources we have here!
I still feel as though I personally relate much more easily to ISFP than INFP, despite the latter being the most often mistyped (or so it‚Äôs said).  I can also agree that you guys do get the short end of the stick in a way, with Fi being your dominant function and, well, being sensors.  The more these biases perpetuate, the worse it‚Äôll be for online MBTI sources in the future.  
Thanks for taking the time, though!  I‚Äôll be lurking around to learn more about you guys, no doubt.  =)"
3010,isfp,"Starting today there will be a weekly thread to share anything that you ISFPs have created. It doesn't have to be something that you made this week, it can be old or new.
The weekly art thread will supplement the weekly ""What's on your mind?"" thread, and will be stickied to the top of the front page of this subreddit in place of it. The ""What's on your mind?"" thread will be allowed to float with the other posts.
Let the fun begin!"

3012,isfp,"Ahh, thank you, you're too kind! It's really an exercise in coloring and composition. She's just a character idea I've been toying with, some sort of witch. Ever since reading a few Discworld books, I've thought witches were pretty much the coolest."
3013,isfp,"If we're doing something quietly by ourselves but you want to spend time with us, ask if you can do your own thing (browse Reddit, watch something, play a game, whatever) in the same room as us. Obviously, this will probably differ from ISFP to ISFP, but I've found it more comfortable to hang out with someone/other people when we're doing something individually but in the vicinity of one another. 
If you want to talk but you're not sure about what, maybe ask us what we're into, thinking about, or working on lately. I'm usually quiet IRL, but like most people, once you get me going about something I've been interested in, I'll talk forever and excitedly too if I can bounce ideas off of you."
3014,isfp,"Aw thanks man :) I don't mind going out terribly but always keep an eye on us- if we say we don't like a particular place or need to leave, we mean it. The last shitty bar we went to ended with me having a panic attack from trying to get past all these fat sweaty 40 year olds to the door, not fun. ISFPs are super aware of their environments, and the wrong one can be overwhelming, especially for those with anxiety. 
If you can stick with us and find places we're comfortable going (and you don't have to scream to order a drink) uou should have a great time. Pubs over clubs is my general rule. Honestly the fact I get invited out makes my day!"
3015,isfp,"Don't criticize them too much! I have an ENTP friend who I've had to remind on a couple occasions not to question every thing I do, haha. We may not act out of logic, but we're not dumb! Just try to be accepting."
3016,isfp,"Ugh, Instagram. I have a love/hate relationship with that app. I‚Äôll use it heavily for awhile and then delete my accounts and not use it for months at a time and then start over again. Rinse and repeat. 
I mostly use it for discussing politics and religion but I also have a love for art and music (must be my subconscious ISFP showing, haha) so I follow pages oriented towards that too. "
3017,isfp,"I've always been the kind of person that thinks weed is overrated. I always preferred alcohol because it made me extremely sociable n lose control over myself. So yesterday I tried ecstasy and it was honestly one of the best experiences in my life. I've always been the awkward dancer at discos but ecstasy just completely destroyed any self doubt I had in me. I also decided to myself to send the search for love completely out the window until I'm older and just go crazy with girls in future parties. I just can't believe how much of the world has been hiding away from me. I've never been so energetic and emotional ever.
Next up in the list is lsd let's go"
3018,isfp,"LSD was initially the scariest but in the end the best experience of my life. You gotta try it. But make sure your surroundings are comfortable and safe and do it with people you trust. Also, make sure you have a tripsitter.

3019,isfp,"Acid is my favourite but not for partying. When I'm on it I could sit in a beautiful spot and think about the world for hours. Mix it up and explore different spots. 
MDMA is incredible but I can't handle the comedown (Ketamine during a comedown is a lifesaver). I also don't like the social aspect because the connections that I make feel superficial/drug induced the next day. The connections I make on acid feel more authentic. 
Hate weed because it makes me anxious and destroys my social abilities."
3020,isfp,"The good - independent, self contained, and don't bitch about every little thing the way lots of people do.
The bad - make absolutely no effort to correct people's negative opinions about me being an unapproachable, uncommunicative cunt. I could easily put people at ease and it would be in my own interest to do this. Instead I've spent my entire life letting people think I actually am the cunt they take me for. Foolish in the extreme."
3021,isfp,"I like that I‚Äôm open, honest, friendly, and compassionate. I hate that I suck at being a leader, I can‚Äôt get anyone to take me seriously because I come across as ditsy, and I just put up with the disrespect because I hate confrontation "
3022,isfp,"If any one who reads this cares to check my post history, my last posts on this board were talking about my recent marriage. That failed. It's more detail than I want to go into, but young love can die quick when it's thrust into the real world. I ended things, and began looking for who I was as an individual. Artistic outlets were the best, as most of you can relate. I began dating a long time friend of mine, and she helped me focus myself on achieving a goal. I don't mean to promote selflessly, so if a link is wanted I'll post it afterwards. Not quite sure why I'm posting this other than to share the fact that this self-conscious introvert accomplished a dream. Hope you all are having a great life."

3024,isfp,"Whenever you have a new acquaintance, perhaps a new colleague, have you noticed them mimicing the unique things that we do? In obvious way like rotate their hat a certain way even though you know they don't do that bc you were doing it. This might just be a socialogical thing and not mbti but I wanted to bring it up."
3025,isfp,"I do. The stereotypes and social norms that we are held to today do not really make it easy. I am an ISFP Male and really hate how men are supposed to be tough, confident, and the go-getters in a relationship when we as ISFPs are not those type of people. Although I do appreciate my personality type because I am able to easily empathize with others, there are simply many other things that I wish I could improve on. If anything, I wish I could be an ESFP so that I can still maintain the qualities of an ISFP without necessary tiring out after a long day of social interaction."
3026,isfp,"I did before I found my career.
Society can be...  Unappreciative of certain type traits (note I did not say types specifically).  The truth is that, yes, it's unfair.  It overvalues some traits which comes easy to certain types over others.  You say that's ENXX but I'd side more towards ESTX.
ISFPs can make considerable contributions towards culture, and without that society dies.  The heart surgeon does not do surgeries 24/7.  They listen to music, they watch movies, they read.  They absorb.  Our type is usually less involved with creating structure and more with giving context."
3027,isfp,"Well. To be honest, I'm not very aware of most other types. But since my life's (seemingly unrealistic) dream has been to become a musician full time, I find it very encouraging that ISFP is the type most aligned with my dream. Wouldn't want to be anything else just because of this little encouraging thing, to be honest!"
3028,isfp,"I‚Äôd want to be an ENFP cause their lives always seem so exciting.. but at the same time, I like being an introvert way too much so maybe an INFx.. I really just wish I were an N type heh But I don‚Äôt dislike being an ISFP either. In fact, I like it more than I dislike it. It‚Äôs my mental state that I have problems with "
3029,isfp,"That's certainly true, though you wouldn't keep all the same qualities.  Changing the function stack even a little can have sweeping changes.
I know I don't look at actors or other performers (commonly ESFP) and think, ""Oh.  Me but just more outgoing.""  Their contributions and focuses are considerably different.  I wouldn't enjoy half of what they do.  They get a pat on the back from society more often because they fit the mold better, but that's all it is.  A pat on the back.
To get back to the OP's question: it very well might make your life easier, but not because one type is better or worse than another.  It's more to do with the time you're in and the expectations placed upon you - what society needs/wants.  Those expectations may not be healthy, either, if society itself isn't."
3030,isfp,"Mixing audio.  Very hard to make work, more of a 1 in 10,000 kind of thing, but proper application can yield results.
Music aesthetics.  It's ISFP in all facets.   Very Fi involved, you're literally paid for your specific application of Fi.  I could have done other things aside from this (accounting and electrical engineering) but they simply don't provide the same level of satisfaction.  Not even close.  They were more things I could do to make money which didn't drive me crazy."
3031,isfp,"I was never a musician.  That's not required of engineers (though it is very common and semi-helpful).  Hated piano, hated guitar.
Michael Jackson and Rihanna are not musicians in the traditional sense either, though it seemed to work in their favor."
3032,isfp,"I had a feeling my lack of precision would bite me after I wrote ""musician"". I guess the average uninformed person (me, in this case) casually lumps ""musician"" ""singer"" ""composer"" ""music performance artist"" into one big category. Yeah, sound engineer, recordist, etc. are very different too. Oops."
3033,isfp,"It does make sense though and I see why the type is associated with musicianship.  In my experience I don't find it rare, though more ESFP-, ESTP-, ESFJ-, even INFJ-driven (knack for lyricism).  Performing tends to be a more extroverted activity.  Clearly MJ and Rihanna weren't/aren't afraid of that, however."
3034,isfp,"I'd say that a big part of unhealty Fi is being really judgy and not respecting other people's tastes , opinions or values, or even trying to choose what they do, based on what you believe (and not based on what most people believe or on what it socially acceptable like Fe)"
3035,isfp,"My mom, probably. Her emotional trauma as a child is probably why she's an alcoholic (who probably still does drugs). She takes some things very personally. She has a weird general hatred of church because of one bad experience with one when I was a kid, and one year in my teens (I lived with my dad) she was drinking and basically threatened to disown me if I went to Easter service instead of doing what she wanted, no matter how hard I tried to compromise. She needs things her way, and takes it as antagonism if not.
She's also burned bridges with most of our family but blames them for ""leaving"" her, even though she's the one who lies (often for no real reason), stole money, abused my brother and I. 
I think overall an unhealthy ISFP would have a ""you're with me or against me"" attitude, very personal and black and white, and usually deal with their depression or anger through physical means like booze, overeating, sleeping around, etc."
3036,isfp,"Definitely true. For anyone who's going through this right now, seriously try to just go outside. It makes a world of a difference. I find myself in slumps every so often without even realizing myself heading in that direction and literally one day outside riding my bike provides so much needed clarity. "
3037,isfp,I wonder if that's why that's one of my least favorite personality traits in people. Always has been. I grrr irrationally angry when people are judgemental or put others down for differences in taste. People insulting music grates against me so badly. It's subjective. Just because you don't like it or see the appeal doesn't mean it's bad and that everybody shares that view. üò°
3038,isfp,"I'm 22 and have Depression, anxiety and ADHD, I'm overweight and have a bad back and knee, I have 2 friends and have never had a relationship I was also neglected and emotionally abused growing up and am still stuck in that environment until I can move out after college. I hate myself, tend to isolate myself and am scared of interacting with most people probably as a result of my childhood. I'm constantly afraid something is wrong or something bad is going to happen to me and have almost no self esteem or confidence. I feel that no one could ever want me and have a very hard time trusting people especially when they are nice to me. It usually makes me cry when I can tell someone genuinely cares and wants to help me especially when I can't see them really getting anything out of it from me. I've been conditioned that love has to be earned by doing something for someone else and don't feel that I could ever do anything good enough to deserve love because nothing has ever been enough for my family to love me. I'm really fucked up and don't know if I'm fixable but I go to therapy anyway and think it helps. It's really hard but I'm still here so I guess that's something"
3039,isfp,"You'll pull through it!! I promise it gets better! College is rough, living with an unhappy family is rough, but one day you'll be out there living a life that you'll finally be able to choose for yourself!"
3040,isfp,"Has anyone on here been in a relationship with another ISFP? If so, how did it go? What issues would one need to work on for such a relationship to work?
I ask because right now (and for the past year or two) I've been completely infatuated by this girl who I'm pretty sure is an ISFP; she got ESFP on 16p but she said that's more like what she aspires to be and that she identifies more with ISFP.
We met online and are on opposite ends of the earth yet I can't stop thinking about her and how she 'gets me' in a way that none of my local friends do.
Our situation is a little bit odd in that I've told her that I have a crush on her and she didn't outright reject me, but she didn't accept either. She said that she didn't know how she felt about me in that way and we agreed not to make any advances until we meet in real life. Which is fair enough, I am aware that I'm probably imagining her as more perfect than she actually is due to the nature of the Internet and online messaging.
But like I said, I can't stop thinking about her and can't help but wonder what it would be like if we were together."
3041,isfp,I won't have an educated opinion on what it is like dating an ISFP as am ISFP because I am an ENFP but I can tell you that you better stop fantasizing because something impossible is about to affect you in the here and now. You might oversee opportunities because you compare real people to the romanticized version of a girl you will not get together with (sorry). 
3042,isfp,"Identical type relationships can start out great but fizzle out fast as it is too much of the same kind of deal. They are usually based on a sense of sympathy between identicals and often start to feel like a sibling friendship especially if there is some age difference. You can read more about idential relationships on this page.  
And the complete relationships-by-type guide for ISFPs"
3043,isfp,"Part of me knows you're probably right and I should move on, part of me is like ""But what if we doooo get together?""
And another part of me says I'd probably overlook opportunities right under my nose anyway. XD"
3044,isfp,"I'm aware of the theory behind this, but ultimately I believe that if both parties are mature and willing to work on improving their weak traits, any type combination can make a relationship work. I'm looking for first/second hand accounts to gauge just how plausible this is."
3045,isfp,"Going off of /u/thatsoundedsexual 's comment on a previous thread saying that our Extroverted Sensing is a gift and a curse.
On one hand, I can appreciate beauty and when things looks pleasing. This is great! I love using my senses constantly to find pleasure in the way things look, feel, etc. 
On the other hand, I am extremely judgmental. This can be not so great. Sometimes I get physically uncomfortable when things around me aren't aesthetically pleasing. Like I just want to get up and fix it all to feel at peace with my senses!
What do you guys think? Ever wanna just shake someone for wearing that, or go back in time and ask just who made the call to design that building's windows that way? Ugh, all day this goes on in my head!"
3046,isfp,"I do this too, and that's pretty much what I meant by that comment. Sometimes I'll look at someone and think ""Why the hell would you wear that? Get back in the closet!""
Also, this post reminded me that I forgot to put an important fact about ISFPs in the sidebar, which is that we're highly aware of our physical surroundings."
3047,isfp,"I'm probably the least judgmental person I know. But I do agree on the appreciating aesthetically pleasing stuff, and non-pleasing stuff being uncomfortable. But when it comes to fashion specifically, I might twitch at an outfit and wonder why they wore it, but it won't change my opinion of them."
3048,isfp,I've never thought of myself as much of a fashion minded individual but I really hate having to wear something that I don't feel is expressing myself.  This girl explains it.  
3049,isfp,"/u/CKNW98 explains Se to an ENTP... :3
And no, it's not a curse. You embrace your innate characteristics for their good and bad. As long as you're wearing complementary colours and aren't wearing any cotton.

Any cotton."

3051,isfp,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôve done a lot of reading and there seems to be conflicting opinions about ISFP and ESFJ unions. I think ISFPs are adorable and fascinating but also really confusing so if you could spare some perspective, I could really use some backup (:
I (24F) have been seeing an ISFP (29M) for four months and it was great to begin with. His Fi fascinates me, the way he is absolutely sure of himself and won‚Äôt compromise who he is in anyway. I like how his eyes are so expressive and that he sees beauty in things I would never consider and it reminds me to stop and smell the flowers in my no nonsense practical approach to everything. 
He was extremely persistent to begin with and after I agreed to go on a date with him, we got on like fire. He was mentioning things like if I wanted children and marriage and even hinted at moving in together when I almost bought a house. He made sure early on that I was open to a relationship. I thought it was intense but I figured that‚Äôs just who he is and accepted it - I was never sure if he was joking or not. All of a sudden, he became distant for three weeks and nothing was defined beyond the fact that we were exclusive - to which there was no conversation, just that he expected me to not see anyone else because he wasn‚Äôt. 
I knew that ISFPs need space to ruminate and formulate their thoughts so I waited, even though it was excruciating. Eventually he came back but would pull away, especially when I showed affection. He eventually expressed he feels lost in his life, especially in his career and that it is reflected in his interactions with me even though he wanted to be with me. It became a problem when he mentioned that I could talk to (but not see) other guys if I wanted. I was confused and seeing he hurt my feelings, he then expressed he is not good at explaining his thoughts and he wishes he never said it - inferring from other threads, this is something ISFPs struggle with. 
I initially wanted to distance myself in fear of getting hurt and at the advice of my friends of him ‚Äòstringing me along,‚Äô and called him to voice my opinions early so he could have time to then think and get back to me. However in my vulnerability, I broke up with him thinking he needed his freedom and I couldn‚Äôt possibly wait indefinitely. 
I have since realised that I needed to break free of my Fe of letting other people‚Äôs opinions of me inhibit my decisions. I need to go after what I want because it is a real connection I feel and I would regret if I didn‚Äôt at least try. I am worried that I jumped the gun with the break up and that I have ruined my chance. 
I have presented to him my perspective that nobody is perfect and that relationships are a safe place to be who you are, insecurities and flaws laid bare for mutual growth. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being selfish but I care about him and want to help.
In the end, I don‚Äôt want to push him and force him into something he doesn‚Äôt want but am I being unreasonable? I know Fi values doing everything at their own pace and hope I‚Äôm not being ignorantly self righteous by playing saviour. 
Do ISFP/ESFJ relationships never end well? Is there something I can do about the Fi/Fe clash? I had a five year relationship with an INFP so I already have an idea of what it could be like. But I was young and stupid then and have tried to learn from that relationship because it was very fulfilling otherwise. I have been determined to grow from it to be a better person because let‚Äôs face it, I was probably that stereotypical ESFJ that everyone hates.
Will he resent me for trying help and see it as an impingement on his freedom for self discovery? What can I do? I am giving him space to make his decision now but it‚Äôs eating me up inside.
TL;DR    ISFP is hot and cold, I broke up with him out of fear but have since tried to reconcile by trying to work it out. I am trying to be understanding and respect his space but am worried I stuffed up big time. Help!"
3052,isfp,"Yes, if I was in that situation, like other ISFPs, I may need space to ruminate and figure things out about my career, but not necessarily the space that others try to give me (as that may not be the right kind of space), but more the space that I feel I need at any moment. And I may not get why you would be confused by that. And the pressure to want to make you not confused can be a factor that reduces the space I may need. 
Also I would not like anything that felt like betrayal, but could accept genuine reconciliation. "
3053,isfp,"Thank you for your input! What kind of space do I need to give? I have asked him to go hiking - which he loves. I figure ISFPs like present moment time together rather than how are you texts. 
Initially he told me that he was making sure he was mentally, emotionally and physically ready for a long term relationship and figured ‚Äòif it‚Äôs there, why not?‚Äô
That in itself, along with the statement that I could keep my options open made me think he didn‚Äôt really want what we had. When I told him how it made me feel, he assured me he wanted to be with me. 
Then when I called to talk, he tells me that he is confused about his life and he isn‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôs ready for a relationship at all because he needed to work on himself first to be able to build something with someone he cares about.
Since I have presented my perspective, he has mentioned he is thinking about it and has invited me to a work function (that was last minute and I couldn‚Äôt attend) but I‚Äôm hoping it works out okay."
3054,isfp,"We might seem resilient because we can easily cut and run when it comes to dropping toxic people and environments. I was the most confident, carefree person my friends knew back when I was free to drop people/jobs like bad habits the second I was mildly annoyed.
But now that I‚Äôve been forced to stay in a toxic situation for a few years I can 100% say that ‚Äúresilient‚Äù is not the word I‚Äôd use to describe myself. Not at all."
3055,isfp,"I'm currently in my exams and I procrastinate all the time, I feel like I'm dying inside when I'm working on it. 
Honestly at this point I'd rather be punched in the face by a gorilla than work on my exams."
3056,isfp,"It‚Äôs corny to say, but the only thing that has ever motivated me (besides drugs) is love. Loving what I do, or being inspired by someone I care about, or being moved to do something for someone I love, etc.
Otherwise I feel like my mind fights against whatever I‚Äôm ‚Äúforcing‚Äù myself to do, telling me it‚Äôs pointless/inauthentic/boring etc."
3057,isfp,"Bruh, I'm in the same situation, I tell you... 
when I REALLY want to work on things, I go somewhere else than my room with my laptop and stay there for hours on end. Working on projects also doesn't usually go well if I have a lot on my mind for some reason."
3058,isfp,"I used to lock myself in my room and play games and draw until I wanted to leave my room - then I'd just rush the work as fast as possible so I could get out of my room.
You said you feel like you're dying inside while working on it... is this school or something you actually chose to do? If it's compulsory school stuff, have you looked into any alternatives (unschooling, homeschooling, online school, etc)?"
3059,isfp,"Try the pomodoro method along with positive reinforcement. Have a treat system in place, and treat yo' self when you reach a goal or study for a set amount of time. It can be anything - concert tickets, a movie, hell, even some nice chocolates and a cup of tea. Set a timer for fifteen minutes, study solidly for those fifteen minutes. Take a ten minute break, look over your notes for another five. And then repeat the cycle over again. It helps stop you from feeling like you're spending too much time on studying. "
3060,isfp,"go out somewhere like a coffee shop or a library and work. go to, preferably, the library since it limits distraction. this will ensure that your brain doesn't think it's play or sleep time, since, due to the primacy effect, it tends to do that in the same places that you play or sleep. you would not believe the amount of grind time I've gotten in at places that aren't my room. good luck with your exams by the way! "
3061,isfp,"Make it enjoyable. Take it as you time. Make some tea or coffee, put some music on, light a nice smelling candle or incense  and just slowly start working on it. Think about how good it‚Äôll feel once you‚Äôre done lol "
3062,isfp,"i used to put my own spin on things i was anxious about. i'd write a silly story or something about the subject.
it took the power away from it, and gave it to me  
i'd go from internal dialogue like, ""why bother? you'll never get it. you're just going to fuck it up. everyone'll see you for the moron you are."" 
===To, just calmly getting on with it."
3063,isfp,Might already be too late for you now but in the future I would suggest spreading the work out for weeks/months and just do a little bit everyday. Sooner or later it‚Äôll become a habit and going through them will become easier.  
3064,isfp,"Adderall and deadlines. Those are the only 2 things that can make me get my work done. Unless I have the adderall to make me enjoy working or I have a deadline soon approaching I cannot work efficiently at all. Without either of those things I can work, just no where near as efficiently. "
3065,isfp,"I just started a post bacc program (to finish the classes I need to apply to med school) and I HAVE to find a quiet place, set a timer and focus for an hour at a time when I study. I put my phone on do not disturb and remove all distractions until I'm done. "
3066,isfp,"YES!!!!
Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a really interesting, unique and actually pretty awesome person once you get to know me! I wish more people would try to get to truly know me and love me for who I am.‚Äù
Person: tries to get to know me asks personal questions 
Me: ‚ÄúI ...don‚Äôt like all this attention and think there is a hidden motive???? I‚Äôll just not open up all the way.‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúI wish more people would try to get to truly know me and love me for who I am.‚Äù"
3067,isfp,"I started doing it again this week (weather is getting a little better), and I just pick a route to follow and stick with that doesn't have much people around. I also play Pok√©mon Go, so I just keep looking at my phone when someone walks past me. Works well enough!"
3068,isfp,"Put your headphones in and block the world out while you walk. You can start by just going a block or two if it‚Äôs overwhelming. I get extremely anxious during the work day and running/walking on my lunch helps calm me. It just takes getting into a habit. 
Side Question: Have you ever tried meditation?"
3069,isfp,"If you have access to a bike or something, I personally find riding mine to be a much less anxiety-inducing form of getting outside/active than walking, as it serves as a layer of detachment from surroundings and offers a much quicker escape method from potential problems. "
3070,isfp,"I get what you mean; I literally have the same issue sometimes. Such as worrying about seeing certain people or whatever. But to answer your question - Yes. Obviously if you really don't want to then don't force it, but it's definitely worth it. You'll likely be very happy you did!"
3071,isfp,"Thanks for the advice. I love listening to music while I walk. Sometimes I get anxious because I get so lost in the music that I can lose sense of my surroundings sometimes. Yup, I have tried meditation. It's great. Never had any magical experiences with it though. But it does help relax and calm me down a whole lot."

3073,isfp,"This is the thing that I most think about, and it's probably just harming myself, because if all I think about is how I'm not good at convo, I won't have anything interesting to say in a convo lol.
But yeah, I usually don't start a conversation. If I do, it's usually boring small talk, which doesn't last long. I always wish I was better at conversation, I remember when I was younger I would call friends on the phone and I was the one that would talk for awhile, but now, I feel it is much harder to hold a conversation, and it sucks because it affects my social life and my confidence in making friends and finding a SO.
And how did you make your close friends? I feel like I usually don't talk to my friends that much if they aren't in close proximity, so I tend to get distant."
3074,isfp,"I don't often initiate conversation in person even with a friend.  
If I know the person I'm talking to, I usually don't have too much trouble understanding them and their point of view.  I read that ISFPs are good at that.  However I struggle to think of something to say a lot of the time if I'm not particularly engaged in whatever we're talking about, so small talk is often one sided.
I'm self conscious of my voice and I think that's part of the reason I avoid talking if I can help it.  I get tounge tied over certain words and phrases and feel I just can't say them coherently and people sometimes ask me to repeat myself.
My close friends were made at school, mostly because we were in the same class and kind of stuck around the area since we graduated.  
I hear what you're saying about making friends, finding a partner etc.. :("
3075,isfp,"This sounds very familiar. I am very shy and don't contribute much to conversations except with coworkers I'm close to.  I'm sure I come off as boring. I find myself parroting things back to people if I'm feeling especially uncomfortable, or repeating things like, ""That's awesome!"" and, ""Woww, that's so cool,"" while the other person does all the talking for me. I never know what to say or what an appropriate way to react is. Or I stay quiet because I don't know much about whatever they're talking about and don't want to sound ignorant. I also get tongue-tied often and get frustrated and embarrassed. Friends are important to me but I forget to maintain the relationship and am terrible at making new ones, so I really only spend time with coworkers."
3076,isfp,"I'm capable of talking excitedly and at length about events in my life, though I tend to almost zone out and almost forget I'm talking to someone. It's as though my internal monologue is externalizing.
In real life have a problem with pulling away from the conversation too soon. I think it's an anxiety thing."
3077,isfp,"I know exactly what you're talking about. I am absolutely terrible at small talk. I'm trying to get better but it isn't working out very well. It's very rare that I'm able to initiate a successful conversation and I'm always self-conscious about how I talk. A lot of times my words just don't come out quite right. I trip over a word here and accidentally slur a word there. It makes me immediately want to stop talking, and then the conversation just dies. 
I started imagining conversation as a game of catch, where the entire objective is just to get them to reply in order to keep it alive. It seems to be working out so far, but now I'm afraid that I'm asking too many questions and that they'll come out sounding really insincere."
3078,isfp,"Yeah same, I usually understand easily. Same with my friends, I stuck at community college since I still had a few local friends, but I lost contact with them and was a loner until I transferred. Made new friends at college, but now I'm off to look for a job, and scared that I'm gonna start losing friends again. I felt like I lucked into getting friends both times, it's not that I don't want to talk to people, I just don't know what to say. I feel like I'm stuck on listening mode in conversations. I envy people who can easily entertain and start conversations, I feel like someone would get bored of me quickly.
And the not having a girlfriend yet doesn't exactly help my confidence at getting one in the future either lol."
3079,isfp,"This. I've had the exact same experience on numerous occasions. I hate it so much. It's like I'm trying to be friendly to a girl at work and then suddenly my entire vocabulary dissipates and I'm stuck just repeating the exact same comments over and over again, like the ones you said. I always wonder if they notice and think I'm boring or something."
3080,isfp,"When I want to try to connect with someone, learn about them, make then like me or whatever, I love to ask questions.  Just asking someone ""what do you like to do"" is good way of breaking the ice and as an isfp with that talent of perceiving character, it could really go a long way :) "
3081,isfp,"so this might seem like a stupid question.
I have 1 close friend right now, my sister. But there is somebody else who I have a very good gut feeling about trust-wise . I think he is an INFP, and he seems very mature. I got to know him a few years ago at a summer internship program and I know he has a pretty good character (I am pretty good at vetting people btw in an Enneagram 8ish way, and almost everyone fails the tests). and We both have had similar psychological experiences, it seems (lack of trust, depression, avoidant personalities). We knew right away about each other that we were kind of on the same wavelength (in a non sexual way). Him and my sister are the only people I have ever had this feeling with, the kind of person I never get into a flight with. (Yes you might be thinking I am overreading into this but no, I am not, I have good evidence to back this up.)
He is also very supportive in general.
How do you get to know someone? Although I am bi it is perfectly non sexual, and we prefer to communicate through text (less personal than phone calls)."
3082,isfp,"By just being in the company of that person. Mainly what happens in groups but it takes months to really speak to someone. So when I say diffusion it is what I mean. I soak up until I feel comfortable. Diffusion was the easy way of explaining it. 
Texting is always easier but it isnt personal for me, so after a while I'll loose the connection, I have to see a person on a semi regular basis. But then this isnt counting my closest friends. Them I can go months without talking and then still have the connection. "
3083,isfp,"Im to tired to explain this point properly but it matters. Im not just rude for no reason and I don't feel that it should be justified by just being Reddit.  So thats that. xD cool cool cool
I sometimes find activities with people act like a catalyst for getting to know someone, but you dint have to trust someone completly and want to tell them your heart. Its good to just be able to do stuff with people evey now and again. "
3084,isfp,"Do you guys struggle with depression? I've been dealing with it for a few years and was just curious if it's common for our type. If so, what are your signs and thought patterns while in a depressed mood? For me it's not wanting to get out of bed in the morning, thinking I'm ""different"" or not wanted, and just trying to stay in my comfort zone. I can lead a normal life and no one would know but it does take a lot of self talk to get me out there and to dismiss my negative thoughts. I'm interested to hear what you guys think!"
3085,isfp,"While I have never had full blown depression, I have figured out ways to make myself feel better when I am feeling down. Usually, I try to just forget about whatever is bothering me by planning out a full day where all I do is stuff relating to my hobbies and just keeping busy. If for some reason I can't do my hobbies that day, I research random ones to start or go out and do. Personally, I find that when I have a lot of free time and am not busy doing stuff during the day I get sad pretty easily. 
Also look up stuff to do with positive psychology and the science of happiness. Maybe some of the things to do with that will help"
3086,isfp,"The belief that life wasn't only going to hand me lemons. I knew recovery was going to be a long process, because my depression had lasted years. Getting better was hard, but I had a tiny bit of faith in the future and there was something better out there for me. Idk if that helps. "
3087,isfp,"Just saw this so thought I'd respond. I actually had slipped into a hole of depression recently. Depression for me, similar to you OP, is not getting out of bed, feeling eternally bored and unsettled, and not eating. It's also being really negative and critical of everyone and everything.
 I also get into a couple of cycles. One is telling myself I'm a piece of shit for staying in bed all day instead of being productive, so I feel worthless and undeserving of friends or happiness, so I stay in bed all day. Another is that I keep putting things off. Like, oh I don't need to go to this class, I'll just watch one more YouTube video and then I'll get up and go to the next class. But then that time comes around and I'll convince myself that I don't need to go to that class either and that I'll just aim for the next one. Then I've skipped 3 of the 4 classes I had that day and I don't see the point in going at all. 
Depression is super hard, man. 
I'll tell you what though, actually making myself smile and do little jobs around the apartment really does help. At least for me. Even if it's just taking the laundry out of the machine and setting it on the end of my bed. Little accomplishments help. 
Hope things get better for ya. "
3088,isfp,"I think depression may be the opposite of expression. Like another person said creating things might help. For me, I have a lot of unfinished projects so I never get the satisfaction of completion. Also, for me I spend too much time in my head so I started a journal."
3089,isfp,"This is an important point about isfp, I struggle finding things to do due to my location and time. It is important for use to create something that we call our own, for us to see the beauty in it, and then if someone else likes it aswell it is even better. "
3090,isfp,What helps for me is doing what I want or need to do despite the voices in my head telling me otherwise. There's a great book i read in the worst point of my depression called Feel the Fear and Do it Anyway and it really looks at every aspect in your life and how to manage it in a more fulfilling way. On an in the moment basis I like to listen to motivational speeches by Les Brown and that will usually pick me up (there are many motivational speakers and videos on YouTube). Seeing a therapist regularly is very helpful as well. There's something for everyone and hopefully as an isfp some of these things will help you guys too.
3091,isfp,"Seriously, what the hell, brain? Every day of the week I wish I could go home early so I can do stuff, and before you know it it's saturday night with HOURS of free time and... now I just feel empty and don't want to do anything? What a waste of time..
Also, pretty much every time I promise to work on or do something together with my INTJ cousin my excitement usually fades within an hour or so and I just force myself to go through it anyways.
Sigh."
3092,isfp,"I‚Äôve found that if I think about grand concepts and big ideas it gets overwhelming and I shut down. Best for me to just chip away on things consistently. Sometimes getting started is the hard part. I just tell myself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to work on this for an hour.‚Äù  Set a timer.  Do the hour. If I‚Äôm feeling good about things keep going if not, at least I did an hour."
3093,isfp,"Can‚Äôt speak for all, but when I have a lot on my mind and someone asks me ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù it‚Äôs like my brain shuts down. I really want to share, but (maybe out of defense?) my brain and mouth won‚Äôt communicate. If I‚Äôm given a chance to bring it up once I‚Äôve organized my thoughts, I‚Äôm able to share more easily. 
Also sometimes I‚Äôm only bothered for two minutes and then I‚Äôm over it. So, it‚Äôs not always necessary to share what‚Äôs on my mind. "
3094,isfp,"It depends on who‚Äôs asking. I have a couple of close friends I speak to. If it‚Äôs coming from a place of genuine concern, then yes, I would share if something is bothering me. If I can sense that someone is just being nosy, then I wouldn‚Äôt share. It‚Äôs a very small trust circle, and I would only share with them. I don‚Äôt trust people easily and if I am willing to share with them, then that means I trust them enough. Even then, it‚Äôs hard to share. Sometimes it‚Äôs not personal. I just don‚Äôt wanna talk about it. "
3095,isfp,"You just talk, and wait for them to open up (if they feel like it). 
 Sometimes silence works, too.  
It's showing that you're there for them, whether or not you know what the problem is.  
(this isn't really type specific)"
3096,isfp,"If there is something wrong, what's the other person gonna do about it? I'm a grown ass adult. I keep my mouth shut if somebody asks me something like that. I'll be the first one to say something if anything I say is gonna change anything."
3097,isfp,"Just be like, ‚ÄúDo you wanna talk if something is bothering you? You don‚Äôt have to if you don‚Äôt want to, but I‚Äôm here to talk if you need to.‚Äù And if your friend decides to open up, then be as genuine in your response as possible. People are either looking for empathy or solutions or a combination of both. I suppose the challenge is to know what your friend is looking for. Usually, if you‚Äôre close friends or have been friends for a long time, then you‚Äôll know. "
3098,isfp,"I‚Äôll share shallowly with friends. Minor inconveniences or typical annoyances, especially if I think they can relate to it. I very, very rarely share my problems wanting advice. If I‚Äôm sharing, I just want validation. 
Most of my sharing is with my fianc√©. I do share quite a bit with him if I think it will be productive for me/us. He‚Äôs learned that if I want to talk about something I‚Äôll bring it up. That was confusing for us at first because he really needs to be asked (he‚Äôs ISTJ) about his feelings to be able to process them. "
3099,isfp,"I don't think it matters. If it's playing on their mind (and they're willing to share), the conversation will probably steer itself in that direction.  
You can fall back to FORD, but I reckon it's best to let things play out with light convo/time together, etc.  
Sometimes just being there for someone/being trustworthy, can be enough of a problem solver in itself.
Sorry if that sounds trite at all‚ÄîI could do with a nap!"
3100,isfp,"It's an acronym for Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. i.e. potential convo topics. things people are generally emotionally invested in.
eg - family - ""everything alright at home?"" ""are your parents ok?"" ""has your sister finished her degree yet?"", etc."
3101,isfp,"

I spend most of my time indoors, behind my PC. I find going outside more of a necessary evil than a pleasure. I'm pretty lazy overall and prefer just sitting and lying around and being comfortable. 


I'm very jaded with lots of things, I'm very hard to impress. ""Look at this mountain, it's so huge!"" ..yeah, so what? 


I don't do self reflection. 


I really hate talking ""typical sensor things"" like small talk, what the neighbors did last weekend, etc.


I talk a lot when around people I'm close with. 


I come up with some what if situations here and there, and think about them in my head. Not to the extent of an INFP, though.

"
3102,isfp,"That's the I.
That's not sensor things. Sensor things are practical, reality kind of things. The Fi makes us want them to have relevance for our lives in particular.
Also an introvert thing. Vs extrovert who would just tend to talk a lot.
This is the only one that is weird. Cause you cant Fi without self reflection. Unless it just comes so naturally you don't even realize it."
3103,isfp,"-I hate confrontation and will avoid it in any kind of way !
-I Hate crowds- they give me anxiety 
-BIG daydreamer
-Chill mellow & laidback all the time. 
-I procrastinate a lot - not as much as before because I‚Äôve been working on willpower but yeah I procrastinate some lol
- I really like/love kind people. When I see someone who‚Äôs naturally kind & sweet I think wow üòÆ this persons beautiful I wish I can be more like them , more graceful üôÇ 
- I‚Äôm VERY sensitive. I can‚Äôt take criticism üòï I know that‚Äôs bad but even if I try I still get my feelings hurt üòî 
I‚Äôm very hard to get to know If want to be hard to get to know , you know ?? 
I draw clothes to design- I want to be a fashion designer one day so I guess that makes me a artist - & I do love doing fun art projects for kids even though I‚Äôm not one üòä 
I love my and appreciate my home . I still live at home but I daydream about how comfortable I‚Äôm gonna make my apartment when I do move out.
That‚Äôs it I think üòä"
3104,isfp,"Just wanted to say that you guys are really cool! My best friend is an ISFP and hes one of my most favourite people. Im an INTP and me and him just seem to get on so well. He respects my need for space and he always texts me at night if we had a lot of banter that day to check if i am okay. He's a really good cook and yesterday he was making me pasta and he described the tastes of garlic as musical notes, which to me was crazy but also really interesting.
Keep going you guys because you rock :)"
3105,isfp,"I also like to make nice meals. But I absolutely hate garlic;) I love to get good feedback on my cooking. If I get negative feedback I will stop cooking and call them retards lol. I love praise but I can't take criticism too good. If I get praise I am like an energizer bunny, happy and enthusiastic and everything. If I get criticism I will most likely try to get you out of my life as fast as possible. "
3106,isfp,"Yeah we have completely opposite functions, so we do have quite a few differences, however we have many common interests, mainly cooking which I also enjoy, and he is willing to listen to me talk about my latest research obsession which I am grateful for because most of my friends are not interested."
3107,isfp,"Its interesting that a lot of ISFPs are actually one of the most knowledge hungry types,  I admit though that I was biased against you guys so i apologise. Could you explain possibly why ISFPs could be data hungry peeps"
3108,isfp,"Today I was approached by four different people who claimed that I looked sad and tried to cheer me up even though I was in a perfectly good mood. Like one guy even gave me a pep talk saying that I ""can do it."" Do what I don't know, but the point still stands. Do people confuse your emotions for being sad even when you're not?"
3109,isfp,"Yes. When I have zoned out or if I'm concentrating people will say I look sad, mad, or upset. I think some people think if you don't act happy all the time then you must be sad. Then I say I'm fine and they look at me as if I have lobsters coming out of my ears or something.
edit: or they say I don't look fine, then I have to get into a whole discussion about it which is annoying."
3110,isfp,"Women and old men have often said this followed by, or only said this, ""smile! "" which despite their probably good intentions is annoying and of course doesn't make anyone but themselves feel better, and I usually am fine when they say it anyway. Just deep in thought or busy! 
However, when I asked my boyfriend about the smiling thing, he said they're just hitting on me.  They don't actually care how I'm feeling, it's just lazy attention."
3111,isfp,"My neutral look is similar to the INTJ death stare, the difference I think being that behind the stare is a more introspective, emotional person. When I'm in Se mode though, I can be wild and tons of fun and smiles for days. But in basic functioning I don't show any basic emotion (except pissy or sad apparently)."
3112,isfp,"Yeah Fi me is serious, but combined with my light fun Se I can adapt to any situation. Eventually though I just zone out into myself and look sad apparently. Whatever I don't need to prove my actual emotional state to anyone with a facial expression ;)"
3113,isfp,"Particularly with an ENTJ. That's what I'm thinking my bf is, I find it more challenging to type someone you're dating somehow lol. Also I don't know very many to do a comparison. 
Curious if anyone had a relationship with one or still are, and how it worked out? "
3114,isfp,"I was just in a relationship with one for a year, and let me tell you it wasn't too healthy for me. I'm very easy going and he hates doing what other people want to do, so I ended up compromising on everything. I hate influencing other peoples actions, so I wait until I'm right at my breaking point before asserting what I want/need, and even then he'd always respond with ""nah dont feel like it sorry."" He had no empathy. I love to go out and go on adventures, and he loves to stay home, so we only went out a handful of times. On the rare occasion that we'd go do something I wanted to do, he'd spend the next few weeks reminding me of how generous he was for doing that for me, and how much energy/time/money it took from him which made me feel like a burden. He sapped my energy and gave so little back. He never expressed much affection and I need affirmation. He liked to play hard to get and I withdraw when someone seems like they aren't into me. Needless to say I'm not recommending this situation. Your boyfriend might be different, mine was unusually self-centred. I like to think not all ENTJs are like him."
3115,isfp,"ISFP Care and Handling User Guide and Manual
Congratulations! You‚Äôve managed to coax an ISFP out of their favorite hiding spot! Here‚Äôs a handy guide for taking care of and getting to know your quirky and mysterious new friend.
Your ISFP comes with:

Ten unique and interesting clothing items
Two sets of worn and comfy clothes
One animal friend
One collection of inspiring photos and/or random objects that are meaningful to your ISFP.
One set of closely held moral beliefs and values

Custom upgrades: Your ISFP will have multiple creative interests. Books, sports equipment, musical instruments, camping gear, cameras, various art supplies, and random junk may also be included.
SoftwareYour ISFP comes preprogrammed with the following traits:
Fi: Makes your ISFP unit independent and sensitive. They may appear aloof or distant, preferring to process their emotions on their own. They‚Äôre actually very warm, loyal, and supportive when you get to know them. Your unit also has a strong moral compass and will refuse to do anything that conflicts with their values. Contrary to popular belief, your ISFP is capable of changing their views, but forget trying to force them into doing it!
Important note: Each ISFP will have Fi values, morals, and beliefs that are unique to them. You will need to adapt this general user guide to your specific ISFP Unit.
Se: Your ISFP is very in touch with their physical world and enjoys using their five senses to explore and express themselves. They can be impulsive and adventurous, preferring to live in the moment rather than plan too far ahead. Se also makes them witty and charming and surprisingly cute.
Ni: Your unit will have the need to search for deeper meaning in their life. They will frequently ‚Äúhave a feeling‚Äù about a plan or a person that they will feel compelled to act upon, but not be able to explain. Also makes them incredibly self-critical and may induce occasional bouts of self-doubt.
Te: Your unit may have many dreams, but probably won‚Äôt get around to actually accomplishing most of them (without help, anyway). They can also be stubborn at the inopportune times and unintentionally (and hilariously) blunt when asked to give their opinion.
Getting Started

Sit your ISFP in a quiet room, preferably near a window.
Set the animal friend in ISFP‚Äôs lap.
Leave ISFP alone for several hours to adjust to their surroundings and bond with the animal friend.
Offer ISFP cookies and initiate conversation about the animal friend.
If ISFP doesn‚Äôt start, take them to a nearby park and let them wander for a while.

ModesCinnamon Roll Mode (default): Soft, sweet, and bashful. Prefers to listen to you talk and observe you quietly. Notices everything and knows your favorite food, what kind of car you drive, and probably where you live even though they never asked. (No, it‚Äôs not creepy! They just overheard you giving directions to someone else and didn‚Äôt want to bother you needlessly.) Will make you quirky, adorable (and sometimes baffling) gifts to demonstrate their affection.
Creative Mode (default): Your ISFP has a nearly unmatched creative brain and will often find beauty in their environment. If you don‚Äôt really understand (Yes I‚Äôm talking to you NT types) just voice your support and point out one or two things about their art (or song, or sport, or hobby, or project, or handmade gift/peace offering) that you like. Your ISFP will be flattered and happy that you appreciate their talents and are involved.
Adventure Mode: Your ISFP unit will live for meaningful adventures, and often express longing for the freedom or ability to try new experiences and visit new cultures or sights. Actual chance of them acting on these desires is 50/50, but your ISFP will spend a lot of time daydreaming about it nonetheless.
Sensory Recharge Mode: Your ISFP unit may go dormant after a large social event or adventure. While they enjoy sensory activities, they easily become overstimulated and need time to themselves to process everything they‚Äôre taking in. Forget trying to have conversations with your unit while they‚Äôre in this mode; they‚Äôll quickly excuse themselves and hide.
Angry Toddler Mode: Activated under stress. Your ISFP has become so emotionally overwhelmed (usually due to feeling they are not Good Enough‚Ñ¢) that they just can‚Äôt handle any more. Symptoms include grouchiness, outright refusal to eat or engage in normal activities, and uncharacteristic outbursts of anger. Gently relieve your ISFP of any pressing responsibilities and give them space to express their feelings without judgement.
Relationships with Other UnitsNF: ISFP enjoys relationships with NF types, drawn to their emotional depth and idealism. In friendships with these types, ISFP is free to discuss creative ideas and dream big. ISFP will also go to these types for emotional support in times of need.
NT: Your ISFP may not initially gravitate towards NT individuals, as they often don‚Äôt understand their rational nature. However, they are intrigued by the intellect and personality quirks of NT types.
SJ: Your ISFP will want to ride through the glen on their mighty steed, firing arrows into the sunset while the SJ in question will probably want them to calm down, organize, and behave themselves. If not handled carefully, this can result in conflicting goals and thus, stressful relationships.
SP: Your ISFP unit will be most at ease with fellow SPs. They can go on spontaneous adventures together and your ISFP unit is guaranteed to have a couple in their social circle. (Also the #1 culprit when your ISFP randomly disappears.)
FeedingYour ISFP unit will have an unusual diet and eating schedule. Mealtimes and snacks tend to happen when ISFP finds it convenient. Don‚Äôt worry about regular meals, your ISFP likes and appreciates food and will make sure that they are eating when they need it.
GroomingISFP is very particular about their appearance. When it comes to hygiene, they tend to stick to the basics, but can be relied upon to take care of themselves. However, If you want them to be on time for something important, remind them to prepare beforehand‚Äã.
SleepingYour ISFP will flip-flop between intensely creative periods where they will forego sleep to work on projects (or go adventuring), and ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù periods where they will sleep through the day to recharge. Don‚Äôt interrupt your unit‚Äôs sleep times, as this may activate Angry Toddler Mode.
*Frequently Asked Questions*My ISFP won‚Äôt activate (talk), now what??
Stop trying so hard! You can‚Äôt force an ISFP to be your friend. Chances are excellent that ISFP picked up on your efforts to connect from the beginning and is well aware of your intentions. Give them time to observe you and gently coax them out with non-aggressive, non-threatening communication (or fun. Or cookies. Or compliments. Or kittens).
Also, keep in mind that silence isn‚Äôt necessarily an indicator that your ISFP doesn‚Äôt like you. Often it just means that they‚Äôre thinking; either processing what you have to say or coming up with something to contribute the conversation. Look for these signs instead: does your ISFP go out of their way to spend time with you or do things for you? Do they make eye contact when you‚Äôre talking? If so, they like you.
How do I know if my ISFP is doing okay emotionally?
Ask them. They rarely open voluntarily, as they don‚Äôt want to be a bother. Keep in mind that it may take some time before they‚Äôll be comfortable sharing with you. When they do talk, listen and validate their feelings. Avoid jumping in and attempting to fix their problems for them or giving your own opinion too quickly. Your ISFP will keep their mouth shut rather than risk subjecting their precious thoughts to unsolicited criticism.
My ISFP has disappeared, help!
Relax. ISFPs are prone to going AWOL without warning. This doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre in trouble. They will probably reappear within a day or two with an interesting story about how they went on a last minute road trip with friends and met a eccentric biologist who studies Bigfoot in Tennessee. Resist the urge to check on them too frequently. This will lead to more disappearances (your ISFP is trying to escape from you). If you‚Äôre really worried, casually invite them to get food or do something fun."
3116,isfp,"Wouldn't called it bitch face, more of a resting gloomy or annoyed or dont talk to me face, unapproachable.
I realized as I get older and understand others dynamics with me that I can have that face and noticed a few isfps have that too.
Mostly when busy in thought or just minding own business, not doing much. 
I sometimes use it to type other isfps as well.
What do you guys think?"
3117,isfp,"I'm a very independent naturalistic kind of person. The thing is I have a friend who is a cog in the corporate machine. I had no idea I was so judgmental until I found myself accidentally revealing my judgement for corporate professional people to her while talking about others. It was too late to backtrack and I just let it slide but I could tell I said something a bit tactless. Similarly I have other judgements about things, like anxiety being an unhealthy thing despite the fact that she very clearly suffers from it. I feel really bad, I probably said 2 not very nice things. It's just that I guess I value individuality so much I do judge those who sacrifice that for boring secure jobs and value that lifestyle. And I know we need all types of people but I have all these unconscious judgements that help me define and differentiate who I am. Especially since I had a really bad experience working in the corporate world which I guess I still haven't processed. Wonder if other ISFPs suffer from this and what you do about it. For the record I do like and care about her even though I probably just made her feel worse about herself which I would not have done if I thought ahead. It's pretty selfish and I guess I wanna know if others here have felt this and what you've done about it."
3118,isfp,"Entp here you might want to just read Enneagram 4 and look at the healthy unhealthy distinctions and that might help give you a guide to understand why your own personal values, introverted feeling might not be good outside of yourself in certain scenarios"
3119,isfp,"Not from around here (infp), just curious, you say let it slide, does that mean you're going to leave it as is, with her maybe feeling badly? 
I'm sure you plan to be more careful in future, I just couldnt imagine not needing to clear the air. And I'm curious how you isfp's tick."
3120,isfp,"Like you, I am Also judgey of corporate cogs and I hate capitalism. I hate capitalism because it is so harmful to people, animals, and the environment and corporate cogs just perpetuate its existence more than others.
We should still try not to be jerks though."
3121,isfp,"Thanks that's super helpful. I'm a level 5 it seems.. used to be a 9. Yeah I really need to ease up on some of my identity. I just don't know how. I don't know who I am without it. 
https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-4"
3122,isfp,"Interesting. Well I do see this problem in others so I do have some advice. I guess I didn't see the point in trying to backtrack on something I had so clearly said. It wasn't an intentional direct criticism, the implication was indirect, so it's obvious enough that I didn't mean it that way (even though it was tactless and lacked forethought). Bringing attention to it would just give it more energy. It's like accidentally starting a fire but then you decide to add more petrol to put it out - don't be surprised if it consumes the entire conversation and leaves you vulnerable. So you leave it alone and let it die and move on to the next topic. Know you'll do better next time. No one's gonna hold a few mistakes against you. And hey at the end of the day, she is an adult who made the decision to be a cog in the machine, she can handle it not fitting someone else's worldview. I do plan on later introducing the topic of conversation again and finding a way to show her that I support her lifestyle and do respect her need for security, or perhaps disclosing my bad past experiences with the corporate world so that she understands where my poor judgments may have originated. "
3123,isfp,"Hi all! I'm an ISFP and I've been surfing for books that would,
 well, feed my Fi. If that doesn't make much sense all I'm looking for are books (fiction/ non-fiction) that could give me perspective- a new lens to look on at the world from, could be rose tinted or brokenn doesn't matter, but something you've read and are convinced that this could possibly be the most enlightening/ enjoyable/ quirky read on existence!
(Eg, The Little Prince, Salinger novels)"
3124,isfp,"Reading through Anna Karenina right now. Don't let its age or subject scare you off. It has some of the people-ish people I've ever read.
Neil Gaiman books are also pretty great- they have this great fantasy world building that's done from a limited, understandable, human, perspective, and the books themselves are pretty insightful. I'd suggest reading the Graveyard Book first."
3125,isfp,I am an ISFP human struggling to grasp the actions and unrequited love of someone I hold dear. I have a tendency to be emotionally invested in people I come across that peak my interest. And this one person in particular I happened to quite like to try understand. Does anyone else share a problem like this?
3126,isfp,"Yeah. Working on getting over a complicated situation currently. Honestly, the biggest thing that helps me is reflecting on how quickly they entered and changed my life- because I know there are more wonderful people that will randomly enter my life in the future. 
For now though, it sucks because I see parts of them-- what they taught me about life and myself and unique behaviors I adopted from spending a lot of time with them-- reflected in how I act on the daily. "
3127,isfp,"Yes sometimes I feel very emotionally unstable but I don‚Äôt appear to be so because I internalize it so well. For example, I feel really angry right now and had to really dig at myself to figure out why. "

3129,isfp,"Hi! I'm posting this for my ISFP husband because he doesn't have a reddit account. A few days ago, my family talked about our favorite channels and what we watch are so different. My strategist INTJ brother spends most of his time on informative or historical channels while I (mechanic ISTP) love watching a guy tearing down phones and game consoles. My husband just watches movie trailers and some game reviews on YouTube but he doesn't have any specific channel he likes.
So do you guys have favorite channels to share? He's into games and anime but is open to anything. He's more curious to see what his type likes to watch. Thanks!"

3133,isfp,"I'm male and the women who tend to be attracted to me are usually not very sure of themselves. Over the years I've sorta learned to extravert feeling (you mean people can't just feel my loving nature?) and have become something of a quiet encourager, I think. Oddly, bossy cougar types like me too, but the liking is not mutual."
3134,isfp,"I'm male, and the females that I end up dating (Not sure of their MBTI types - btw which MBTI types are most aware of their own MBTI personality type?) are typically loud, outgoing, dominate conversations, active, stubborn, and passionate... not sure what that says about me.. haha."
3135,isfp,"Female 
Not gonna lie, most people, men and women alike are attracted to me as friends and sometimes romantically. Usually TJs and TPs like me romantically not sure if that‚Äôs just because they‚Äôre common or if something about ISFPs draw them in. "
3136,isfp,"My fianc√© is very active/restless (always trying to improve the house), sweet, comfortable being in charge, and very friendly with other people. Makes me feel kinda weird saying bye to someone after she ends a conversation and I realize I haven't said a word. "

3142,isfp,"So I'm very certain on the ISF part of my personality type. But I'm really conflicted about the last letter. I have a really hard time making decisions, I like to keep my options open, but at the same time I am constantly fretting about the future and wondering which move I should make next. I have social anxiety, low self esteem, and depression,  but I'm not sure if I'm a Perceiver who over thinks or a judger who doubts herself too much! "
3143,isfp,Definitely ISFP. An ISFJ would get super stressed out but feel better having everything planned out just so. I have anxiety and avoiding all of that helps me a bit. Like NOT thinking of the future is when I'm relaxed.
3144,isfp,"That's the thing, not thinking about the future is just as stressful for me as not making plans. Like, I'm just depressed and dissatisfied enough with my present to where I'm constantly looking forward, but i still don't know what i want the future to look like"

So I have an ISFP friend and I am wanting to get to know them better. Also wanting them to open up more I feel I am often sharing more stuff with them than they are with me. Any advice would be much appreciated.
Thanks "

3149,isfp,hey guys I‚Äôm an ISFP obviously ahaha I would like to know if any other ISFPS highly struggle with telling others when they are annoying you. for instance: is someone hurts my feelings or annoys me I won‚Äôt tell the person because I severely struggle w letting out my emotions so I tend to ignore them unintentionally and they get very very mad at me bc I‚Äôm being selfish and taking their feelings granted ( bc i‚Äôm taking my time as if they‚Äôre always gonna be there) however I do take a LOT of time to process how I‚Äôm feeling days even weeks and once I do confront them I start crying bc it‚Äôs too overwhelming! i‚Äôm sorry for spamming you but I would love to know if u struggle w this as well and if so how u deal w it ! have a good day üíñü§ß
3150,isfp,"I'm great at telling my feelings and annoyances to people I know very, very well. People who I know will not abandon me if we hit a rough patch (i.e. my husband, my parents).
I'm not as good at explaining annoyances to friends and best friends because I either A) decide I need to be more accepting of the way they view things, don't want to hurt their feelings, and decide it's not worth losing the friendship, or B) I decide I know the person won't receive it well based on my read on them.
In both A and B scenarios, I always need to take a break from them to process, process, process. It's like solving a Rubik's cube. 'Maybe they're like that because of this... or that, etc."" I try, almost to a fault, to see things from their perspective, assess why I'm so offended, and whether I'm being irrational. This can take weeks. Sometimes I process the conflict so much, I get over it. Or I'll set new mental boundaries with that person such as ""When I'm around so-and-so, I will not bring up [ X ] topic."" If ultimately I decide the friendship isn't worth keeping, I slowly pull away. I will not 'ghost' people like I did when I was younger because it's not right to blatantly cut people off. But I will do the slow pull away so it's not so painful.
The intense ruminating and processing helps me to decide between letting the issue go, pulling away from the friend temporarily while I lick my wounds, pulling away permanently from them, or, the dreaded idea of confronting them.
If they do actually ask me if something is bothering me, I usually see this as a chance to have a conversation and how we can work on it. It will depend on the person though and if I perceive things going well in the conversation.
I know I should be more fair to people by allowing them to explain. Because even in my 'amazingly empathetic' processing, I am still making assumptions and not allowing them to defend themselves or to point out my shortcomings (gasp!). I shouldn't shy away from confrontation with friends and should be more upfront when I'm bothered by something they did, but you know ISFPs and confrontation. I get emotional too and just want to cry getting the words out. The confrontation has to be very much so 'worth it' for me to engage.
I have found, however, as I age, that I'm not as afraid of confrontation with non-friends. It's empowering. Now, if only I could mature and work on healthy confrontation with friends..."
3151,isfp,"As an INTP who has dealt / is dealing with this... yes you guys have problems with that sometimes... i am currently being ignored and it hurts like hell. I realize you guys have a hard time expressing yourselves candidly, but please, if you can find it within yourself, just tell them as soon as possible. Most good friends would be willing to change their behavior if they knew it was annoying. Dont be afraid to ask for things.üò±"
3152,isfp,My brother is like that with me. It hurts a lot when he avoids me rather than explain to me what he's thinking. He's decided that he just has to deal with the feelings of hurting me rather than avoid me. 
3153,isfp,that‚Äôs exactly how I feel with my family I can express myself but my issue is exactly with my friends like you stated I do need time to figure myself out and will only make to effort to confront if they‚Äôre ‚Äúworth‚Äù it so in my mind i‚Äôm taking ok I‚Äôm going out of my comfort zone bc they actually mean a lot to me. however they think how she has spent all this time ignoring me she really must not care at all and when I explain my view they just say I‚Äôm mean and don‚Äôt take their feelings into consideration. i‚Äôm sorry for bothering u again you were very helpful and thank u so much for spending the time to help :)
3154,isfp,"Surround yourself with people that doesn't think you're crying over a small matter. 
If you don't cry often, the people that knows you and loves you will know that it's a serious problem. 
Don't worry about that, we're all crying inside ü§î"
3155,isfp,"Yes, the pulling away to process period can be painful to others, especially for the type of people who are more ""You gotta problem? Tell me to my face!"" It's true that being ignored is painful. It's very painful when people ignore me too.
Instead of pulling away so much while you process, here are some things that help me while I'm figuring out how to handle an offense:

Instead of ignoring texts, take a little more time to respond (3+ hours). Keep the conversation light and fluffy. Keep the focus on them and what they're doing. If the topic switches to 'How are you? Everything okay?,' give a vague answer and flip it back to them!
If you do see each other, keep the meetings light and fluffy such as a quick lunch or coffee, etc., or better yet, a group activity. Avoid any talk about emotions or feelings or difficult situations. Talk about... your planned vacation... your pet... your classes... your job. Anything but emotions.
If they ask you 'What's wrong!?' you can say ""I've got some stuff going on and I'm not really ready to talk about it."" Try to smile. Don't look cold and distant. That way, later if you get over it, you're not required to confess to them the issue was them. Or, if you decide you do want to confront them, you can more easily segue into the confrontation and it's not such a shock.

I think you can explain the need for the space when you finally do have a conversation with them, it will be helpful. Be vulnerable... talk about your your need to process, your communication style, your shortcomings, and your missteps before presenting your issue with their behavior. ""I'm sorry I've been MIA, I've been a bit busy but also needed some time to reflect."" Approach the conversation from a ""I want to understand and resolve this"" stance. ""Maybe I misunderstood you."" ""When you did this, it made me feel this way"" versus ""Why do you always do this!""
I got ignored/dumped by a longtime friend recently (an ESFP) and while it does bother me, part of me doesn't want to know what her problem with me was. That's how non-confrontational I am, haha! I understand friendships can have a shelf life that expires. It sucks. If this were to become a pattern for me to get dumped, I probably would want to know what happened. But at the moment, I'm fine with letting her go with no closure.
Sorry, I'm rambling, don't know if what anything I'm saying relates to your original post at this point, haha!"
3156,isfp,you‚Äôre not rambling at all you were actually so useful I‚Äôd never thought of that I always got upset bc people didn‚Äôt want to understand my inability of expressing myself while I‚Äôm totally ok when they blow up on me (when I upset them for instance) and offend me when they don‚Äôt mean it. I can also totally understand where you‚Äôre coming from with the ESFP friend of yours I never confront people even if it‚Äôs something slightly more important like your matter I believe in destiny when it comes to friendships stuff happens forcing people is unnatural. thank you so much for your advice I have never before chatted with another ISFP that actually understands how I feel 100% you have no idea how much it helped.
3157,isfp,"I'm not really sure of how to sum myself up. I just know between tests, and other people I seem to get typed as both. I have originally thought I was INFP, but then lately people have been telling me I seem more ISFP.

Also I'm willing to hear on perhaps what are some huge, differences between ISFP's, and INFP's.
Please, and thank you."
3158,isfp,"Someone mentioned a while back to add age to these posts, and I like the idea. 28 male.
I don't know many people who are as loyal to their inner circle as I am. If people talk about my friends behind their backs I'll stand up for them even if it causes conflict. I normally go to extreme lengths to avoid conflict. If a friend needs help I will go to the end of my branch to help them. Even if that means risking breaking my own branch. If I see someone doing you wrong, or think someone is doing you wrong I will let you know. If you need a friend to talk to at 3 a.m. feel free to call me even if I have work in the morning. If a bar fight breaks out I will more than happily risk getting stabbed to help you out. If you need someone to call you stupid to get you back on track. I will. If you need someone to help you bury a body. I will. If I can't help you. I will find someone who can.
These statements only scratch the surface of what I will do for people in my inner circle. If you drove up and just said, ""I can't tell you why. Put on this blindfold and get in."" I would blindfold up, get in, and not ask questions. My inner circle is a very small list. I know damn well they aren't gonna hurt me intentionally. I don't how else to explain what I am willing to do. I will do almost anything. I'm not gonna join a cult and drink the cool aide with you. I'm just gonna beat the fucking stupid out of you. I am always the person they call when they fuck up. I don't know if its because I'm reliable, or if they just feel comfortable telling me the whole truth. I am always the person they call when they need help, and nothing could make me happier. I pride myself on being able to be there for my close friends.
This just applies to my inner circle though. I will extend above average human kindness to 99% people, but I won't go out of my way in any regard. This includes my blood relatives with my mom and dad being the only exception. I would kill someone for hurting them. I honestly don't know if anyone else will ever make it into my inner circle. I don't get out much. I'm a homebody. Occasionally my ENTJ best friend drags me into his newest scheme to take over the world, but thats about it. Its not that I'm bad at making friends. I fucking excel at making friends. I just don't become close to people anymore. I only have so many hours in a day, and I have enough close friends to fill those hours as is."
3159,isfp,"I‚Äôve recently gotten into MBTI Theory, and most of the online tests had me pegged as an INFP or INFJ.  But after being typed by others online as an ISFP, and understanding more about the Sensory/Intuition dichotomy, I‚Äôm fairly certain I am indeed an ISFP.
My question is, what are the nature of your daydreams, and how focused are they?  
I daydream all the time when I am in boring mundane environments, but they are always focused on things rooted in reality (not abstract ideas).
For Example:  
I love to travel overseas... it is what motivates me more than anything.  At any given time I will be mentally (and literally) planning my next 3 trips. When I am in the office at work, I will spend hours on end, mentally away from my current surroundings, thinking about what hikes I want to do in Iceland, or what Lisbon neighborhood I want to stay in.  Between sets at the gym, I‚Äôm mentally cataloging things I want to do on my next adventure, or while driving at a stop light I‚Äôm picking up my phone to look up the best baguette in Paris because it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been thinking about for the last 5 minutes.  I go days/weeks entirely focused on a small set of ideas/themes... and it completely consumes me.
On the flip side, put me in an environment that I‚Äôm passionate about, and my mind goes blank except for that which is around me, and I‚Äôm locked into every detail of my surroundings... taking it all in.
For Example:  
I‚Äôve played competitive soccer my whole life. Once I step on the field, everything is instinctual... my mind and senses are locked into every key detail of my surroundings, and my entire focus is on everything going on in my environment.  I also snowboard... when I‚Äôm on the mountain, everything is the feeling of floating through the snow, the beauty of nature, the peaceful quiet of the mountains... all my senses are focused on my environment.  Same thing when I hike in nature, or am walking around a foreign city taking in every detail of the art & architecture, the conversation of the locals, smells of the food.
I live in the present when it interests me, and when I‚Äôm somewhere boring, all I‚Äôm thinking about is transporting myself to a better present.  I have very little long term goals other than living life to the fullest... my work (which bores me, but I am good at), is merely a necessary paycheck to fund my passions, and my mind transports me from those mundane environments on a daily basis.
Also, I should note that most of this mental planning I do constantly goes out the window once I get to the moment I‚Äôve been thinking about for hours on end.  Once I am there, in the here and now, I do what feels right and any itinerary I put together goes out the window.  I become overcome with the beauty of the moment and my surroundings, and it takes over all else.
I‚Äôm curious... is this a common theme among ISFPs, or might I be mistyping myself?
Thanks!"
3160,isfp,"I daydream about traveling and love. Specifically, growing old in a happy and loving relationship and traveling with that person (like my folks do together.)

3161,isfp,"Infj here. My daydreams aren‚Äôt focused at all. I think focusing might actually limit my daydreams. I hop from one topic to another.

The craziest daydreams are the best. Please no reality. üòä"
3162,isfp,"Yes, now that I think about it, I daydream about love as well.  I‚Äôll meet a woman I like and find a connection with, and before we are even dating, I‚Äôll be thinking about things like what it would be like married to her and how her name would sound with my last name.  But then in reality, I never act too into her in real life until (if) our relationship actually moves forward and I get to know her... It‚Äôs kind of weird. "
3163,isfp,"This is probably an old thread by now, but I too (also ISFP)imagine about traveling and love. I imagine of who I‚Äôll be in the future, who I‚Äôll fall in love with, and I especially dream of a trip around Europe I‚Äôd like to go on one day. Very similarly to you, very basic things."
3164,isfp,"Yes, I had one of your fellow Intuitives who pegged me as a Sensor explain similar experiences to me, and I think that‚Äôs one of the reasons I started realizing I am a Sensor... despite all the tests I took telling me otherwise."

Arsenal are my favorite club (frustrating! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), although I also like Roma because of Totti, and PSG because Paris is my favorite city and I attend matches whenever I‚Äôm visiting."

I used to play striker when I played 5/7 a side but now I realised in 11 aside midfield suits me more (CM/CAM). I'm a spurs fan haha, I live right next to the new stadium, yesterday I got lucky as I got free tickers to watch them play against Dortmund! I loved it, what a great atmosphere it was as well as a great game and brilliant score for us. "
3167,isfp,"That‚Äôs great (except you being a Spurs fan ü§¨).  I wish I had easy access to World Class soccer here.  Our MLS team just got a new stadium, but the quality is frustrating, and it‚Äôs nowhere near the same type of atmosphere."
3168,isfp,"Yes, I‚Äôve seen a couple PSG games while in Paris, and I saw an AS Roma game while I was in Rome. I‚Äôve never seen an Arsenal game because I‚Äôve never been in the UK during the season. I‚Äôve also seen a number of European teams play when they do offseason tours in America."
3169,isfp,"You can find it anywhere... it‚Äôs the World‚Äôs game.  If you moved to Thailand, you would see kids playing on the beach and in the streets.  You might not be able to attend Spurs matches, but football is everywhere."
3170,isfp,"True true, but it still wouldn't be the same, everyone here talks about football. It's so easy to find people who play regularly even if it's not competitively. I don't think it would be the same there. "
3171,isfp,"I wanna change. I wanna move out from home. Its cheaper there as well, if I get a job online I can live a more comfortable life than here in the UK. There's a lot less crime there than here and the weather is better there. I will miss my friends and family a bit but I feel like I need a few years to myself. I'm 17 so I think I will try to move out in 1-2 years. I doubt I'd live there for ever but I think it's going to be a nice experience for me. "
3172,isfp,"I recently realized that I come off as very abrasive to my friends because I never use positive words of affirmation towards them. I usually crack a sarcastic joke (who do you think you are getting that promotion? / this soup is just so terrible I'm gonna have another bowl!) but recently I've been feeling some distance between my friends and I. I feel very cheesy and hokey when I even think about saying basic nice things like ""good job on that project!"" or ""really happy for you!""  I always express my ""love"" so to speak by doing things for people or spending time with them, not in words. Wondering if this is an ISFP thing? :/"
3173,isfp,"Yea man, I feel your pain. This kind of stuff has gotten me in troubles with girlfriends past. Its hard sometimes, but I generally try to get out of my way sometimes to make people I'm close to feel affirmed, and there are a lot of people who are affirmed by words. I usually watch and take mental notes (usually not consciously) at the way people affirm or talk to me (which happens a bit from some, I tend to desire verbal affirmation a lot as well as time). A lot of times I'll just emulate who I'm talking to, which can definitely be difficult sometimes, but if they're close to you they are generally worth stepping a little bit outside of your comfort zone for.  "
3174,isfp,"Oh hey... Glad to see I'm not the only overtly cynical ISFP... I don't know why we do it. But expressing your love for people through actions is definitely an ISFP thing, it comes from Fi being our dominant cognitive function. Te, which controls speech, is our our auxiliary function so we don't express ourselves verbally very well. It's not exactly a great combination if people expect you talk a lot. I'm getting over my cynical nature and my problems with verbal communication just by growing older and maturing.
Edit: Oh and congrats on finding us! I've been trying to resurrect this subreddit for a while now and it's finally getting some new content. We're glad to have you aboard."
3175,isfp,"This is just something you have to force yourself to get over. When your friends have something good happen, make your quip but then add ""seriously though, nice job!"" or something. Unfortunately, when you aren't innately good at this stuff you have to train yourself to do it. I had a really hard time with this when I was young and it took a lot of just paying attention when it was happening and gradually correcting myself. It gets easier and your friends will appreciate it a lot."
3176,isfp,"Yes, definitely. I SUCK at speaking the way I feel towards someone, even if I LOVE them! For example, if I really care about someone, I'll buy them a gift I know that they'll love/always wanted. I'm not sure if any ISFPs here are into drugs at all, but me and some friends rolled a few months ago, and while all of them were talking about how much they loved each other, I couldn't EXPRESS it with words... still! So, it's definitely a weak spot we all could work on, because sometimes I feel like my lack of expression may cause my friends to doubt the actual way I feel about them. I'm very passionate, I just tend to keep it on the inside, unless I'm drunk.. then I'm a verbal mess haha"
3177,isfp,"Thats probably why this subreddit has so few responses. I feel like most ISFPs are pretty good at just knowing when it's necessary to speak about something, but then remain quiet and observant for the other 90% of the time"
3178,isfp,"Fuck me, man. The thing about the blurred inner world contrasting the more vivid INFP inner world is spot on. Sharing my visions or ideas is extremely difficult because they're all shrouded in this fog and only appear for a short moment every now and then.

3182,isfp,"Risky post but no regrets.
Not to be super ISFP, but all the extreme speculation within MBTI forums are starting to feel silly / pointless to me. I used to be a lot more interested in mbti, but now it just seems like a lot of us are obsessing over something that we feel like Myer-Briggs types gives us, when our types just don‚Äôt do anybody justice. 
I think the most harmful part about mbti that I‚Äôve been seeing, is how people overgeneralize others based on their type, even though there are literally SO many other factors in play to why they‚Äôre that way (to the point where it‚Äôs not even funny). I also think if you define yourself strictly to the inconsistent descriptions circulating the net about your type, you‚Äôre gonna brainwash yourself into thinking you‚Äôre supposed to fit into that mold, as if you‚Äôre getting assigned an identity rather than going out and finding it yourself.
Sure, I‚Äôm glad people have found fun in it, or have found people to relate with, or have found it useful for their first step in self-awareness, but it‚Äôs (sorry,) just a little silly how much time we spend trying to define ourselves (and others) according to these types. 
Even the enneagrams. For those who follow it, I got 5w4 and read multiple times that it‚Äôs ‚Äúalmost impossible‚Äù for an ISFP to be a 5w4, unless they‚Äôre an ISTP. But who made these rules? How are logic and emotion mutually exclusive? And who even cares at this point? 
At one time I was, by habit, typing everyone in my head after being subbed to r/mbti and this sub. Then I very quickly started feeling really silly about it. Now, I‚Äôve taken it upon myself to notice the key, defining traits about others and stop there. I also make sure to not hold any of these traits against them (because they‚Äôre subject to changing and are allowed to change themselves as they grow, and I also acknowledge that I might just be misunderstanding them). 
I still like this sub and will visit from time to time. But I just needed to bring up how ironic it is that mbti, originally designed in hopes of helping us understand ourselves a little better, has become a somewhat misleading, messy, and emotional ‚Äúgroup think‚Äù array of conversations"
3183,isfp,"I encourage all ISFPs to never feel like you can‚Äôt do something because you‚Äôre an ISFP.  Do whatever you want!  Grow as a person and move beyond that. When I was typed as an ISFP in college (2007)  I was kind of confused by it, but it made a lot of sense based on who I am/was.  Understand your TENDENCIES, strengths, weaknesses and grow as a person -  that‚Äôs the fucking point of MBTI.  Don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm an ISFP so blah blah blah...‚Äù  Be YOURSELF and don‚Äôt forget to keep growing as a multidimensional person that is so much more than a stupid outcome of a test."
3184,isfp,"Thank you for writing this, it needed to be said. All of it. 
What's life without a little risk eh?
You're factually correct. None of these types do anybody justice. They're a four letter shorthand for four words that are only the tip of the iceberg for who someone truly is. Putting people in a box based on their mbti type is a huge mistake and it does them (and yourself) a huge disservice. 
Also correct. The generalizations and stereotyping gets tiresome. The sheer amount of assumptions people have made about me because they see ""ENTJ"" in my user flair is astounding. I just ignore it, there is zero point in wasting my time attempting to reason with people who are seriously trying to stereotype me based on a fucking mbti personality type. The level of superficiality is truly a sight to behold though, in the sense of, ""wow, isn't that a delightful cesspool of hydrochloric acid!"" kind of way. Pfft. 
I understand in a cold, detached, academic kind of way why people feel the need to define themselves strictly by their mbti type. A lot of factors go into it. For many people, especially online, they're young. They don't know who they are and they're massively insecure and they find some comfort in the label, it gives them an anchor at a time in their lives when things are often extremely chaotic in both their internal and external worlds. But it's also a very bad idea, personality doesn't fully mature on a purely scientific level until a person is well into their 20s. So, naturally, mistyping is literally inevitable if you're below the age of ~25 or so. 
The other reasons people define themselves strictly by mbti type are sadly not so innocent/benign. It's because they're vastly unhealthy for whatever reason(s) and they're clinging to their type as an identity for many reasons. There's a lot behind this and is frankly beyond the scope of this post so I won't go into all of it, but there is that playing into it also. 
Agreed, I'm glad people have fun with it too and find it useful. I've personally found it to be a highly useful tool for self-awareness and personal growth, and for understanding other people. But the important thing is that self-awareness and personal growth and all the rest of it cannot begin and end with mbti. 
You're right, it is silly. 
Okay, that's utterly absurd. How is that ""almost impossible""? Good lord, what planet are these people on? I'm an 8w7, typical for an ENTJ, okay so what? What if I was a 4w5? Oh, I bet that would cause an uproar! 
This is just getting arbitrary at this point. For fuck's sake lol... I'm actually laughing because what in the ever loving fuck are they talking about? An ISFP can be a 5w4! There's no rule against that! None whatsoever! 
Logic and emotion are not mutually exclusive. Literally nothing is black and white. Good lord. 
You're ironically displaying ten times more logic and rational thinking than the average NT that's active on r/mbti. 
The irony is not lost on me, either. Again, thank you for posting this. Very wholesome, we need more content like this around these subreddits. "
3185,isfp,"Interesting. Looking at this is like looking into the future for me. I‚Äôm still at the point where I‚Äôm typing everyone else and still trying to figure out how this relates to me as I have been typed as INFP as well, and recently ENFP.  "
3186,isfp,"Don't mistake the community of people with the knowledge that can be obtained. There is a ""people element"" to virtually every community out there. How people use a tool does not suddenly render that tool less valuable/useful.
But if you're here for the people, then maybe it's not worth staying."
3187,isfp,"INFP here (or INFJ, still not sure), also an Enneageam 5w4 and i agree: the mbti sub seems to be full of misconceptions and people defending silly interpretations of the type. Just yesterday an INFJ tried to argue that Fi doms can't be good at logical reasoning (cause inf Te and shadow Ti).
I don't know what keeps me from leaving this place. Also I took a quick look at this sub and discussions seem to be more civilized than in the mbti or INXX subs. Sadly I'm no sensor :( sometimes I wish I would be one. "
3188,isfp,"I'm an INFP, and I sometimes think this. I feel like being too invested in MBTI can make you forget that it's just a personality system - and people are still people. 
I hate that I've started thinking of people in terms of their personality type instead of just seeing them as human beings.  "
3189,isfp,Ive been thinking about this exact thing for a long time now. Its nice to hear about the positive aspects of yourself(it may not apply to you tho)but the thought of giving myself a type is unnerving. I dont wanna be forced to conform to some label. I like being who i am. Its a love hate relationship with the MBTI but i cant deny that it helps you to find a place of people who think similarly but NOT exactly the same. We all have small nuances that makes us unique but the MBTI doesnt really cover those. We need to find them out for ourselves.
3190,isfp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/mbti] Lately I‚Äôve been feeling like Mbti is a pointless hole to nowhere.

¬†^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
3191,isfp,"I think anything can be misused. MBTI, iphones, computers, politics, etc.... you continue the endless list for me. I use it pragmatically. I don‚Äôt like the stereotypes either. I tend to fit perfectly in an ESTJ and enneagram match up and there is even a fictional character like me. Hahaha! What‚Äôs the chances hahaha! But I dislike stereotypes. I have this very pragmatic way I look at MBTI. This theory doesn‚Äôt float in mid air. It has to connect somehow. It matters how you use your tools. I‚Äôll take politics another concept. You can‚Äôt just theorize about using power or you‚Äôd come up with something like the republic. Philosopher king really? Reality check please? Also same with MBTI. This is why I see functions as strengths and weaknesses and rather focus on the possitive parts. I also don‚Äôt go around thinking about mbti all day everyday. I‚Äôd go mad! I always like to link it to solid things that I can grasp at. Practical knowledge. YOu can have all the knowledge you want of MBTI but is this sound logic? Is this real stuff you are researching is it applicable?
So yeah, I agree. I wouldn‚Äôt say the tool was useless. It‚Äôs sometimes useful but don‚Äôt think about it too much or all day every day."
3192,isfp,"honestly, it is. for so many years i was looking to mbti to tell me who i was. i kept mistyping myself because it always just felt like something was missing. then i gave up, developed my sense of identity simply by doing things i love, came back, and was all like, ""oh duh im an ISFP."" it's a weird process."
3193,isfp,"You're exactly right, but your title is not very correct... It simply depends on what you're doing with it. What you're describing is using MBTI wrongly enough to cause all of those problems.
But MBTI imo isn't stupid or useless, pointless. It opened the path for self-discovery, self-improvement, understanding of others and of the human psyche in general, and much much more. That to me is invaluable, and I'm not even using it to box people around, if you use it for understanding, you will never box anyone.
But there is also a scientific, psychology side to it, and that also isn't pointless. It helps give you additional perspective into the psychology of humans, and see new concepts arising from old ones. Discovering the psyche, where it can go, its limitations, working with the functions to understand new concepts such as the flow of time being perceived differently, wondering about the unconscious and the shadow functions... It's marvelous.
I mean, yes, your post is completely valid in the sense you meant, and we could use MBTI to go so much more deeper somewhere, furthering our understanding of the world, ourselves and others... And we're using it for dumb categorisation and stereotyping, for fun dumb downs, not even furthering the theory, merely stalling in it. Because yes, MBTI is not a complete theory yet. "
3194,isfp,"It's rather the opposite, an ISFP 5w4 would be something that I won't know what would look like compared to a lot of typical ISFP 9. In fact according to this post, there are roughly 3% ISFP 5 so yes it has happened before.
 https://www.personalitycafe.com/articles/18288-mbti-enneagram-correlation-according-personalitycafe-data.html#/topics/18288"
3195,isfp,"very small sample size, it was exactly 1 person answering with type 5. could be an anomaly. Isn't too important anyway. It us against the stereotype, but don't forget that stereotypes are also useful. withozt them, we had no idea about what an ISFP might look like. It connects attributes to the 4 letter types. "
3196,isfp,"Have something interesting/funny/meaningful to talk about. Don‚Äôt try and reel them in with baseless small talk because they will immediately forget about you after. 
Be real and genuine and authentic. Don‚Äôt beat around the bush, just say what you feel. They won‚Äôt judge you (unless you‚Äôre being a bully or prick, which they won‚Äôt tolerate). Isfps love speaking with straightforward confident people who can just express themselves freely- no matter who they are. 
Don‚Äôt invite them to social events where you have to dress up and be fake and smile a lot- they will make an excuse not to show up to those.
If they‚Äôre going out drinking, it‚Äôs probably to a dive bar or a friendly, low-key neighborhood hole in the wall. There should be pool or darts or something to occupy them while you‚Äôre there. They don‚Äôt usually like to just sit places, they like being occupied. They despise dance clubs and loud crowded bars. 
Make them laugh. Tell them a dark joke.
Talk about their favorite books and authors. 
Have a dog or cat for them to pet. "
3197,isfp,"If you're interested in making friends with an ISFP, make sure to introduce yourself first and be welcoming. Don't be afraid to go up and talk to them because they aren't entirely sure if you like them. They don't like or want to impose on anyone. I feel that if you start to notice them and talk to them more often then they will start to see you as a nice companion to want to be around and start to open up to you a bit more over time.
Be genuine and respectful, if you don't it can be misunderstood as a negative impact, like attacking them or going against them and will begin to lose interest in the person. If they come to find out that you were lying about who you are or lying about something repetitive it will lead them to not trust you anymore and even cut you out of their life. Personally, I prefer people who are friendly, good manner with good intentions who I'm comfortable with versus someone who is likely to always be negative with their surroundings. They most likely want to be given and receive the same respect and treatment as they have for you. I'll add that maybe most of them tend to be serious too. If they know you really well, they will laugh along with you if they aren't as comfortable around you then they won't find it as funny as you think it to be.  If they do make jokes, they will first find out what kind of jokes the person likes because they don't want to offend anyone around them.
If you have things in common that will make things much easier to talk about because they can be passionate about these things so get to know what they like. They don't really enjoy small talk and it's not very enjoyable. They prefer you share topics (like favorite things, family, songs, art, etc) with them to help them better understand you as a person. They can be sensitive towards people who like to gossip a lot and that can tend to be uncomfortable for them. They enjoy people who are very easy to talk to, individuals who aren't afraid to be in their company. That's because if your uncomfortable, they will know it and in turn make them feel uncomfortable too which will lead to a very difficult atmosphere to be in. Also, don't put them on the spot. Last thing they want is confrontation and conflict. This will probably make them tend or want to stay away or even avoid you if you approach them in that manner. Instead be warm, kind and understanding of them and their feelings because they will see that and appreciate it even if they don't tell you.
Also, giving them positive comments (what they were wearing that day that you like and noticed, what they do or done for you or others) will make them happy and feel noticed because they don't tend to share those things out loud.
Once you know what things they like to do, go ahead and share some enjoyable experiences with them. If you want to hang out, make sure they are available for it first and don't pressure them into it, give them time to think about it more, this is if they seem hesitant to answer and haven't agreed already. Plus, don't take it too personally or negatively if they reject your idea to hang out. There are many chances and opportunities in the future so don't let it get you down. I find that if you hang out with them more in person it feels more genuine to them then just talking over the phone or text.  If you seem demanding for things to happen it probably will not be good for you as they will start to slowly distance themselves and end up pushing you away from their circle.
*Key thing is to be patient, warm and gentle, truthful to yourself and to others, supportive and know that they will always be there for you even if they don't keep in touch with you often. They like and will choose to be with endearing individuals who will make long lasting, good potential friends who they'll remember forever in their lifetime, not the ones who want to use, go against and hurt them or just getting along for the sake of it, their bond is more deeper than that. If they like you enough, they will want to give or share with you thoughtful gifts or little things which they find you will like, much to your surprise. I think they give more than they receive in this way.
It probably sounds like a lot of effort... but those things will be worthwhile in the end and will make an ISFP feel to want and show more interest in developing a good relationship with you.
If anyone have any other questions, feel free to ask or PM. =)
**edit: I wanted to add that if you are trusting and accepting or tolerate of who they are, no matter how quirky they are then why not try and be their friends. They will immensely admire and value you and invest their time with if they find that this is true to your nature. The only difficult thing would be where to find one and if you're able to keep up with them. =)"

3199,isfp,"Talk. 
Listen. 
Repeat. 
I have a really good friend who is an infp and we just started texting and making plans to hangout . It took about a year but we are really close now! I find myself being more of the listener and practical one, while my friend is caught up in over analyzing and getting her feelings too involved. She thinks I‚Äôm super mature.. but okay üòÇ  I‚Äôm really dry in my humor and she just laughs.. but yeah, just do stuff with them and maybe in a year or two you‚Äôll be their best friend. Maybe. "
3200,isfp,Honestly I would say to initiate conversation a lot and keep the conversation flowing. I tend to be very reserved and will let the conversation run dry very quickly if the person isn't very outgoing. Ask tons of questions but also talk about yourself too.The people who I tend to open up to tend to be talkative people who make me feel comfortable. That's really important.
3201,isfp,"Wow we both started pretty similarly. We started texting now we Snapchat everyday for about a month. I don't know I feel like it's pretty one sided, I am often the one who messages I worry that she finds me a little annoying. But I really like her and she's a great listener and one of the nicest people I know. Edit: Also I find it hard to make plans with her, I am like 30-45 drive away without a liscene so each time I need to ask for a ride and no public transport."
3202,isfp,"Before I start. I KNOW we're all incredibly individual and I can't make a decision on this based on MB type but I am just keen to hear other people's experiences and ideas.
I have been seeing my new partner for about 5 months but have known him much longer. It's all going well but I find him quite evasive about meeting friends and family. This is part because in his last relationship he ended up with all these obligations he didn't want.....people to visits, events to go to.
So I haven't asked him to meet my parents but I feel stressed because mu mum is really keen to meet him - especially since she found out we are going away together (apparently it must be ""official"".
So - tell me other ISFPs - what would be you ideal, low stress way of meeting parents? It's stressing me out and I want to mention it to him in a way that doesn't stress him out too...."
3203,isfp,A first meeting for me it would ideally be just about any setting as long as it is just the two of you and the parents are the only ones there. I wouldn't want it to be at a large gathering like a family BBQ or something like that. I wouldn't want other people watching and listening and judging. That comes later. ;-)
3204,isfp,"For me I think dinner out would be an ideal setting. You have the time to talk and get to know each other, but there's also a set time, so it's less intimidating than something more open ended like just meeting at someone's house "
3205,isfp,"Yeah meeting the family can be stressful especially if you and/or partner seems lacking skills in smoothing out things - it becomes more difficult if coming from a family that lacks a common shared speaking language too. In situations like this where there must be some parental interaction, it's best to have a large number of people as to deflect some awkwardness or at least situations where it's not a fixed place (family dinner table) such as a outdoor daytime bbq or some physically helpful task."
3206,isfp,Took the MBTI test about 4 years ago and I was an INTJ. It felt pretty accurate at the time but a lot's changed. I was in my first year of college at the time. Boyfriend (ENTP) took the MBTI a few days ago I decided to retake it. My new result was ISFP. Based on posts I've read elsewhere ISFPs are creative and artistic in a non-tradiitonal way. Just curious what hobbies you all have and looking for ideas for a new hobby 
3207,isfp,Love art history(mostly renaissance stuff) and journaling. Nothing too extreme because I actually have no artistic abilities myself lol. I had to drop my animation class because I can‚Äôt draw :( love looking at art though 
3208,isfp,"Painting, drawing, hand lettering, ukulele, singing, piano, some guitar, percussion. 
I do all these things solo. I will sometimes play music and sing with friends but I am most comfortable doing these things alone. Sometimes I will record a song and let a select few people listen to it because I‚Äôm weird and about people hearing me sing, although I‚Äôm quite good. 
I also paint pet portraits for people upon request for money. It takes me a while to get one done and actually give it to the person. I have two finished ones that have been sitting on my counter for about a month waiting for their new owner. Lol I suck "
3209,isfp,"I never seem to know what I truly want out of my life. I feel that I tend to live in the moment, in that I make a lot of my choices based on how I'm feeling and I don't too often think about my past or future beyond a week, it just doesn't interest me. 
Because of this I find it hard to commit to anything in my life. Maybe I might pick up my guitar for a few days, then I won't touch it for weeks. I just have to be in the right mood for it or I won't really want to start. The same can be said for books, video games, music, exercise, etc. The thing is though, I know that the more I do these things, the more I want to do them and vice versa. I've never really stuck out many of my personal hobbies for too long except for meditation, cooking and internet browsing.
The same can be said about my relationships in life. Sometimes I'll be alone and want to hangout with friends or family, then when I do so I start feeling like I want to spend time alone. I spend majority of my time alone, even though I know I have my most fondest of memories in the company of others. It doesn't help too much right now that I don't have a job and I'm on University break.
With this in mind, if any other ISFP can relate to this, how do you deal with this? If so, do you have any advice? "
3210,isfp,"Discipline. I read something a while ago, the gist is: discipline is when you can make yourself do something you don't want or feel like doing.  
Really, it's all about mental practice. I had the hardest time going to the gym regularly. It's not fun, no one actually ""likes"" it, I would say to myself. I started reading about it, looking at /r/fitness, etc. Then I read one tip which kind of made everything click in the rest of my endeavors too. 
Just go to the gym and get your workout clothes on. Even if you don't intend to workout, just go and change. Get into the ritual and habit of just doing that. When I started, I found when I changed I would just go workout anyway. I was already there, and ready to go, might as well, right? 
So, there's the lesson. Don't want to play guitar? Well, just take it out of the case and make sure it's tuned once a week. Maybe just doing that will inspire you :)"
3211,isfp,"I use my spontaneity to make decisions. I used to be terrible making small decisions (and I'm still working on it) such as meals, what to wear, etc. Now I just say, ""fuck it!"" And pick whatever stands out to me first. Most importantly, I don't let myself change my decision.  "
3212,isfp,All my fucking life man with the big choices. I always get inspired but then I just dont get round to doing it. Which I hate because I have such great ambition but I struggle to find the effort to put the work in. However when making small easy decisions I can immediately take action with focus and precision. I dont know why I cant do the other :'(
3213,isfp,"Having goals makes a ton of difference when it comes to discipline and perseverance. Outside of that, everything is whatever you feel like at the moment, but it can be helpful to stick with plans for the sake of sticking with plans so you aren't indecisive again. Moods and thoughts come and go but usually decisions you make before the indecisiveness hits are good ones.
For example, this happened yesterday:
""I want a fish burrito""
(go to burrito store)
""No, I'm not sure what I want, now ....""
(20 minutes of indecisiveness pass by)
""Fuck it, fish burrito""."
3214,isfp,"Hi there,
I'm 24 and an isfp, indecisiveness has plagued me my entire life so I'm there with you. 
Most of my hobbies last me a couple months, usually till I have a base level in skill in it (like guitar or piano, or video games). I'm not sure if it's ""normal"" for an isfp but I can get pretty competitive so I like to be able to stand my own.
I've had a steady job as a video editor for a few years now which I love doing, people I work with are awesome and the environment is great.
Recently I got a motorcycle and that's been a major hobby and daily transportation ever since, it feels like I'll be riding a bike until I physically can't or die or something lol.
If you know functions I think our indecision is from our Se, just kinda wanting to let stuff happen and experience stuff. Our primary function Fi is difficult to understand and apply at times and I think when we find something that lines up with it it clicks and it turns into a lifelong hobby instead of just a passing one
Hope that helps"
3215,isfp,This is a great answer :) I think I have a cool idea for the sub. We make a thread where everyone writes down their goals that they want to do in the next week. And everyone talks about why they want to do it and everyone talks about it. Then a week later we revisit the thread or make a new one and everyone discusses how they did. Having everyone in on it would be great intensive to get up off reddit and actually try something new :)
3216,isfp,"Thank you for the advice, I think that's a really good idea. I know that discipline does work like that but I think I was doing it all wrong. Whenever I disciplined myself to do something I would continue to do it beyond the point of boredom and dissatisfaction. But merely getting yourself to start an activity might all be enough to keep you going.
I find that exact thing with the gym or fitness in general as you said. Actually pulling myself to go to the gym and get changed is the hardest aspect of it all. I could definitely apply this technique to any of my hobbies or activities in life.
So I actually used this technique today on playing my guitar and it worked brilliantly. I wasn't too much in the mood for it, but once I started getting into the rhythm of it, I was having a brilliant time and then stopped when I felt like it was enough."
3217,isfp,"Glad I could help! The other important thing is to not beat yourself up if you just change into your gym clothes and leave, or tune your guitar and put it away. It's no big deal if you really don't want to, just keep the habit :)"
3218,isfp,"Hi r/isfp!
I am a fourth year Psychology student currently studying in Melbourne Australia. My research thesis is focusing on the antecedents of social and political attitudes and their relations to personality, and here is the survey:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y7SJ5JC
There are some questions you may find interesting (I think...) and does not take too long. The survey is completely anonymous and has human ethics approval (info inside).
If you feel like giving it a go I would appreciate it. Feel free to share the link with anyone you think might enjoy it.
Thanks in advance"
3219,isfp,"I definitely feel that way on a day to day basis. I feel like no one can ever accept me for who I am ever. However, I found that whenever I'm in 'idgaf' mode, I socialise better and I draw people in more. Is it the 'over thinking' thing going on here? Because if it's so, I wish I can learn to not gaf more often, though its a hard thing to do."
3220,isfp,"Every once in a while I get told I'm weird by some judgmental person... but that's how I can tell who's cool and who isn't, by who I can be myself around :) Though I see myself as normal and everyone else is weird."
3221,isfp,"I've just wake up at 3 AM and I'm unable to fall asleep again. My mind started its routine of bombarding myself with concerns. In a few days I start my 3rd year of my career, and still can't imagine how will I get money after classes for food and books. I would simply get more anxious by wondering why my boss sudenly fired me last month and by telling me how unable I am, but I prefer to think that, as always, I will find a way.
‚Äã
Don't go hollow."
3222,isfp,"Very similar problems here man. Lost my job 2 weeks ago, rents due in less than a week and I haven't even payed this month's yet, and I still need to buy an online access code to take an exam this week because Ive been coasting off the trial version until now. I've been in this situation a few times before, I don't know how I keep letting myself get into tight spots like this. But yes, we will find a way"
3223,isfp,"Dont be too proud to seek help. Figuring it out doesnt have to be a one lane road. In the words of Carrie Underwood. I believe we were made to be here for each other.
Be safe friend. Don't you dare go hollow."
3224,isfp,"Hey ISFPs, I require help from you guys, on how to interact and understand what you guys are saying. My new commander (I'm in the military, not US) is an ISFP and I find him a complete mystery. I'm hoping to gather enough information so that I know how not to get on his bad side.        
He seems to be always smiling, yet I don't sense that genuine happiness from him. He hardly talks, and when he does I seem to be completely lost what he's trying to say. He seems to want to get to know me, yet I don't know if he's actually sincere or just required of him.      
So in short, how can I tell when you guys are angry or ticked off about something, and what things (other than universal human no-nos) should I avoid when talking to you guys?    
Thank you people in advance."
3225,isfp,I think what ISFPs dislike are fake ass b*tches. People that try to project an image of themselves that's not genuine and ISFPs can see through that. For example people that make exaggerated claims about themselves. I think ISFPs like realness and honesty even about their own faults.
3226,isfp,"I'm always feeling some type of way, but I tend to keep up a very nonchalant image no matter how I'm feeling.  It'll be hard to tell the way he's feeling unless he specifically states it (probably wont happen; I don't like imposing my feelings upon other people) or if he's severely pissed.  Try to find something you both share an interest in, cause he'll surely have a lot to say about his interests.  I can't small talk for the life of me, so don't be surprised if your answer to ""what's up?"" is ""nothing""."
3227,isfp,"As an ISFP I agree with everything you've said.
Small talk or any kind of superficial conversations are the worst! I usually check out mentally.
 And true when I get mad, I don't really hold it in too well. I do find a way to express it, not necessarily lashing out and frightening everyone in the room though. Not saying it hasn't happened before though haha."
3228,isfp,"Firstly I will be working under him for the next 1 year 1 month, it would make sense to understand him better so as to achieve a more harmonious relationship.     
Secondly, I want to get to know him, he seems to be a really nice guy yet.. I don't know how to put this he's interesting thats all i can say.     
Lastly, he's a Master Sergeant and I'm a 3rd Sergeant, it's better for my team if we could get along. We deal with ordnances (EOD), so cooperation would be great!"
3229,isfp,"Hey, INTJ man dating an ISFP woman.
‚Äã
It's become an increasing pattern that many times, my girlfriend will just seem to drop off the radar for me-time without a heads up. She lives separate from me. This will happen during a period when she'll just normally go home, but then, it'll be a day or two before she even makes a move to talk to me. When I ask what she's been up to, ""just chores, housework, watching TV"". I'll notice she's been active on other social media.
‚Äã
Being a stressed INTJ, I'll begin to look for patterns. I feel like because I didn't get a notice she needed me-time, something else is amiss. Is she losing interest in me? Is she talking to someone else on social media? Do I not mean enough to her to let me know? I'll ask sometimes in ways that can seem accusatory.
‚Äã
Do other ISFPs have a problem communicating when they need alone time? I wish she'd understand that just letting me know will prevent my mind from trending toward cynical scenarios based on forced patterns that I'll make up in my brain. It's like chicken before the egg. If she gives me a polite notice, I'd not feel so insecure and probe her in ways that want her feel the need for more space.
‚Äã
I know I'm at fault here for allowing myself to think stupid thoughts. This woman chose me, and I love her. But is it too much to ask that I'm made aware of when she needs breathing space from the world? Otherwise, I just feel like I'm not important enough."
3230,isfp,"Yes, absolutely. I struggle trying to communicate that as well because it seems selfish(?) or just (in my head at least) self absorbed and I never intend it that way. I love my family, my bf, my best friends but I need a ton of alone time to make up for when I‚Äôm social. I struggle to explain to my bf how much personal space I need as I know it‚Äôs not that normal lol. But ISFP‚Äôs are introverts so we do not gain energy from being social all the time, no matter the individual. I definitely do try to communicate with my bf (still working on this) that it‚Äôs not personal, I gain energy and inspiration and creativity when alone; then when meeting again with my bf/others I‚Äôm in a very lighthearted and happy mood where I can be present and completely focused on the person I am spending time with. Continue to focus on the moments you two spend together and that time rather than focusing on the time spent separate. Make the most out of every moment with her because yes we do like to literally hibernate at times. The world can be a lot to handle. The best is when it‚Äôs just a calm vibe socially, so hopefully this relaxes those worrisome thoughts you have been having. Also, I LOVE INTJ‚Äôs you guys are the best"
3231,isfp,"My experience is that
A) I need alone time
B) I love my girlfriend
C) but alone time is alone
D) So I feel like a broken weirdo for needing alone time
E) And I may or may not take the alone time I need because I feel like the fact that I need it means there‚Äôs something wrong with me
So with the backdrop that I feel defective for needing alone time, it seems invalid to bring up as a need that I have in my relationship.  Plus there‚Äôs the possibility my girlfriend might take my need for alone time as a sign that I don‚Äôt want to spend time with her, or that I love her less, or that I‚Äôm less invested in the relationship.  So it‚Äôs a really tricky conversation to have.  
It really is me, not her.  I need to be alone to recharge.  But good lord it is hard to have that kind of conversation."
3232,isfp,"I used to have more apprehension to say I needed me-time but overtime I got better at it. My bfs is intj and, like you, pretty understanding about it. He is the same way actually. It sounds like something you should talk to her about. Start out like ""am I crowding you at all? I feel like you've been distant and if you need your space I totally understand you can tell me"" or something like that. Idk keep it lighthearted and low pressure and have a good chat about it."
3233,isfp,"I have the impression both of you struggle a little with communicating your emotions. 
Did you try communicating your emotions to her directly? For example like this: ""I feel like ... when you drop off the face of the earth and don't tell me that you need some space."" Then she'll stammer some awkward sentences (at least that's what I would do) and then you reply with: ""It's fine. In the future, I would appreciate it if you could give me a heads up when you're about to do a Houdini."" After she had some time to think about it, you might even get an apology. (Just putting myself in her shoes here; no promises.)"
3234,isfp,"(ISFP) I‚Äôm pretty bad at this in general. My current relationship with (ENTJ?) has made me want to get better at communicating when I need space. Earlier in our relationship I would just go silent on him, because I thought it was ok and I didn‚Äôt want to disappoint him by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wana spend time with you.‚Äù But eventually when I noticed it bothered him, I started telling him ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm feeling x so I may be distant.‚Äù I think he always pretty much took it as me being annoyed by him or what not but I was going through a lot of stress and and needed to internalize to cope. 
Relationships are give and take though so if she values you then she‚Äôll have to learn to communicate her needs. You should force the conversation if it‚Äôs making you feel this strongly. Something as simple as ‚Äúwhen you don‚Äôt talk to me for x amount of time I feel like you may not be interested or you‚Äôre talking to other people because you‚Äôre still on social media.‚Äù
Her response will help you determine if it‚Äôs an issue with communication skills. Everyone‚Äôs different though so it could be her losing interest but the only way to know is to ask üíï"
3235,isfp,"sometimes yes. I don't want to come across as rude or mean so sometimes I won't say anything. can be especially hard if I like the other person or value them as a friend(has not happened to me in a romantic context yet, just casual/platonic stuff)
some people also just come across as too eager or something(not sure on the right word now, I'm tired) but talking to them is weird, and seems like they pry for too much and go past boundaries which makes me want to talk to them less."
3236,isfp,"Do other ISFPs have a problem communicating when they need alone time?
YES, my parents, my sisters and even my closet friends complain from the same issue. Especially my INTJ friend that always says the exact same thing you are saying. Why not just letting me know? Well, who knows.
Sometimes I just don't want to make any communication of any kind, even if it's just 'i need a me-time'. It feels like this will break my me-time already. Sometimes to avoid the hassle of 'Why? is everything okay?' that I truly hates to get in. Other times it just feels selfish and shame to turn the person that cares for you away. 
No matter how you ask for a head alert, you probably won't get it all the time. This is not how me-time works for us. So you just need to know and understand that this is so normal and has nothing to do with you."
3237,isfp,"Unless she‚Äôs literally avoiding your texts/calls, she may not even realize she‚Äôs doing it or that it hurts you.  I‚Äôm super independent, and can go into an introverted mode.  Haven‚Äôt been in a lot of relationships, but it wouldn‚Äôt have occurred to me that it might make someone hurt or nervous."
3238,isfp,"Haha, thanks. Sometimes I'm afraid that my overbearing logic and need or order and planning scares the hell out of my girlfriend. It's like.. I feel like a container complementing a liter of water. I don't want to be too constraining, but it's a balancing act giving her plans and life form to a degree.
I understand the need to be alone, because I need it, too. The thing I don't understand is that my girlfriend doesn't understand that I'm willing to be alone with her, if that makes sense. We'll often find ourselves at the opposite ends of the couch, her watching a television show, me reading a book. I enjoy sharing solace with her. So when she feels the need to take it apart from me, and then doesn't even tell me, it's like a blow to my self-esteem. Like I wasn't worth it. Or like it's something else, much worse, that she's lost interest or has a new attraction in her life."
3239,isfp,"I've communicated it to her almost exactly like this. And she's promised to work on it. But it's been awhile now, and I still feel like she doesn't make it a point to clue me in. It's like her world consumes her and if I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind. And just knowing that the person I care about most isn't even thinking about me in my absence is pretty crappy. It just makes me feel like at the bottom of the ladder, where someone or something more interesting or important to her trumps me. Hence the insecure paranoia about ""well, she's clearly talking to other people"". I don't know. I stir up my anxiety when I don't know why I'm being left in the dark."
3240,isfp,"How would an ISFP lose interest? My girlfriend hates conflict. The moment is arises, it's ""I don't want to talk"". So I wonder if she'll ever eventually break up with me if she loses interest or she'll just emotionally starve me of communication and affection until I snap."
3241,isfp,"No, she knew she was doing it. It wound up being both a need for space and an avoidance of confrontafion. She fell out of love and dumped me yesterday. Sucks, but it is what it is and her penchant for taking space had always been unhealthy for my anxiety."
3242,isfp,"I had the conversation early on with her. The first time it happened, I felt so left out in the cold. Silence from nowhere, and brief responses, if any. It made me question my sanity and look to rationalize why she no longer seemed to care.
I'm trying to do what I know INTJs should to work with ISFPs, but it seems a little unbalanced right now in terms of who's willing to work on what. Shrug"
3243,isfp,Then now that she has claimed to promise to work on it you could hold her to her word and push her a little bit but also give them options such as doing it right now or later.
3244,isfp,"I‚Äôll give you some examples from me:
The bf wasn‚Äôt giving me orgasms or any foreplay for sex so instead of communicating that I was unhappy with that, I would ignore him or distance myself from him. (Eventually told him and he‚Äôs been great lol)
He was doing things that annoyed me like ‚Äúaccidentally running into his ex at a music festival‚Äù or not giving me enough attention, cue me ignoring him because I thought it was best to make him feel bad instead of communicating. 
Could be she‚Äôs losing interest, could be an immature ISFP like I used to be that doesn‚Äôt know how to communicate their own needs?"
3245,isfp,"I'm dating an INFJ so their strong Fe really helps in those situations. Communicating when and why I'm scared to talk in the first place has helped me too, just give people insight into where I'm coming from and help people empathize when they're not great at doing so."
3246,isfp,"I think she's immature in some ways. As often as I talk to her, if I forego responding to one message of hers, she becomes distant and drops off her engagement as though to spite me because she knows it bugs me.
Ironically, at the beginning of this relationship, she impressed upon me that two things were critical to it succeeding: communication and conflict resolution. I communicate regularly, both thought and feeling (despite being mainly logic-driven), and I do not ever leave a disagreement unresolved. Where tempers may flare, I always push for calm and say ""let's talk about this"" when she becomes clearly angry and resolute in not wanting to talk.
I'm just wondering if I'm investing myself into someone that needs too much work for what I need in my life right now. I want affirmation that I matter, companionship, and openness. Instead, I get closed out, ignored, dismissed during conflict, belittled for ""thinking too much"" and left feeling strung along. She's such an amazing woman when she's present. But when she's absent, or upset, it's like she's unable or unwilling to see things for how they affect me. I'm putting all my effort into making things work on my end: being less critical, being more honest with my feelings, and it just feels unreciprocated.
I don't want to let her go because I love her, but I wish she'd try at this as much as I am."
3247,isfp,"Truth. Oh well. In hindsight, she gave great closure and her lifestyle as a flight attendant probably wouldn't have worked with my homebody-ness. Beyond that and our opposite personality types, there was also cultural gaps with her being Chinese and me a white guy. So.. There was a lot working against us. Definitely lots of complications."
3248,isfp,"Yeah, her behavior sounds a lot like what I used to be like. Shes emotionally manipulating you, she may not realize it as such because she thinks she‚Äôs just playing games but that‚Äôs what her actions are. 
I think you need to have a serious conversation with her and lay out exactly what you‚Äôre explaining to me. Tell her you feel dismissed, ignored, and strung along. That she told you communication and conflict resolution were important, but you‚Äôre the only one making effort to do so. Tell her exactly how invested you are, and see if she‚Äôs willing to make a change. If she is willing to change, then I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wasting your time. If she‚Äôs not willing to change rather quickly, I‚Äôd say end it before you feel even worse than she‚Äôs been making you feel now. 
You sound reasonable and caring, you deserve someone who matches your effort."
3249,isfp,"What made you mature? Did you notice it affecting him and improve of your own volition? Or did it take him talking to you? Or was it simply time in the relationship?
I've read ISFP love is slow to blossom. Extremely slow. So I'm hoping that if I'm patient and persistent, she'll recognize me for the guy I am and grow with me."
3250,isfp,"I think I did my usual routine with him (ignoring, not committing, not opening) in the beginning because I thought I‚Äôd eventually get bored of the relationship as always, or that my ways would teach him that he upset me (stupid I know). But over time realized that I really cared, and I wanted my relationship to work long term because I was committed. It took me about a year to feel that way, and us almost parting for good because my actions caused him to say and do hurtful things. But that brief separation forced us to actually communicate and me to be honest with him and myself about why I was behaving that way. Relationship improved drastically from there, but it was a lot to work and caring on both ends. If he wouldn‚Äôt have been so consistent with calling me out or staying interested despite my shit behavior, I probably would‚Äôve quit early on and missed out on what we have now. 
Super cheesy but maybe it will help you in your situation. How old is she? Has she been in a serious relationship before?"
3251,isfp,"She's 28. She's dated before me, but not as many as myself. I don't know much about her past relationships, but they've been longer than this current one. I don't think she knows how to handle a guy that makes himself available on her behalf and pushes for growth and everything she impressed upon him at the beginning. I don't know. I do so much for her and work on myself a lot. I don't want to pester her to do the same.
We had a rough start. I used to be very distant. But I grew to love this girl much quicker than she's capable of reciprocating or trying to improve, so it tears at me. And as an INTJ, my curiosity wants and answer to ""will she get better"" and ""when?"""
3252,isfp,"Are you open with her about your feelings too? That was a big thing for me. My partner loved me, treated me well, made effort,  but never really gave ‚Äúwords of affirmation.‚Äù For me, that‚Äôs what makes me see someone cares. For him, he thought I should know he cares based on his actions towards me"
3253,isfp,"I tell her I miss her and care for her all the time. I told her I loved her, but it went unanswered.. probably a bit too soon for her.
I give her massages. I buy her treats. I want quality time with her often. I run errands for her. I don't think I'm not delivering in any of the love languages.
I've only become really afraid to voice when I miss her or like her or care for her because I'm afraid it will go unanswered like telling her I loved her did."
3254,isfp,"Kind of weird how similar your story is to my situation. BF told me he loved me the first time and I told him he shouldn‚Äôt say things like that unless he means it, and didn‚Äôt say it back. He didn‚Äôt say it again for a long time but the next time he did I believed him and said it back. It was hard at first for me to think it, say it etc. I think you being open will help her open up. But call her out if she doesn‚Äôt say things like she misses you too etc. ask her why"
3255,isfp,"For the past few months, my girlfriend has felt the creative drive that I know all too well. We talked about different hobbies and career paths, and we briefly tried photography and painting. She enjoys both, but neither really stuck.
Last night, she was really frustrated and couldn't articulate herself, so she wrote me a note to explain her feelings:
""I feel helpless and useless. The career thing doesn't bother me as much, but the fact that I can't hold interest in anything does. Never in my life have I really stuck with anything. I hate not having a hobby. It makes me feel lazy, unimaginative, and uncreative... and the worst part about it is that no matter how creative I want to be, no matter how hard I try to push my imagination, I know that they just aren't there. I want it so bad, but I know I just don't have it in me and it hurts. It crushes me. Whenever I play my flute, I HAVE to read off my sheet music. I can't improvise. Whenever I draw or paint, I have to find a picture or object first. I can't come up with something on my own. All I am is a copy cat... and I feel boring. Nothing is my own.""
It's weird, she has a strong desire to be creative, but she seems to be far more ""left brained"" (as you can probably tell from her letter).
Any thoughts on possible hobbies or careers? Has anyone else had this problem? Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
3256,isfp,"If she truly is an ISFP, her not sticking to one thing, and not feeling like a master is not at all outside the norm. Our ""strength"" is in our desire to experience and try things, not in our ""sticking with it"" or more importantly, not in the result, but in the doing. I am not talented at anything, to be honest. I have several hobbies, and have had them my entire life. I tend to bounce around among them, and never truly stick with any one for any length of time. But our specialty is that we can pick up something and do it--and do a fair-to-credible job at it with little practice. Personally, I am pretty good at music, and was able to improvise while still learning my instruments in elementary school--but I've always stunk with drawing and painting. I couldn't do that to save my life. Also, I'm not the best with colors, and coming up with ideas out of whole cloth? bleah. I need a starting point. For me, this is why I like photography. I have a complete ""picture"" to start with, and then I start reducing or removing elements through focus, composition, etc. I love post processing because this is where I can really start to get creative, but even when I was shooting film, I would blow tons of exposures on different angles, exposure settings, etc. trying to get a feel for the subject before it would become clear to me what the subject needed. We are experimenters. We need to experiment--play with it, massage it, work it. Things don't come out the first time.
Just this summer, my wife needed a cover for a book she's writing, and I was tasked with creating the cover. I started with my daughter's idea, but didn't feel comfortable with it. I sat on that cover for literally a month with no progress, but ideas were flitting around in my head as to what I wanted it to say, and suddenly, one day, while googling images (for different things), I saw a couple things, and when I saw the second one, the whole concept snapped into place in my mind, and within the next day or so, I had a 90% perfect cover. I say 90%, because I'm still tweaking it. ;-) 
I guess my point would be this. She needs to just enjoy the experience of doing. When things click they will click. Our extroverted sensing means that we have to be doing things to satisfy our introverted feeling. It is the doing of it, not the having the final product that matters most--yeah, having a completed project is nice, but what matters the most is creating, not the creation. HTH."
3257,isfp,"Your girlfriend sounds INFP and not ISFP. In my experience, I don't have a problem with flip-flopping from thing to thing; I revel in it. This flip-flopping seems to be a terrible problem for my dear INFP friends, on the other hand.
Even if the above point is incorrect, I recommend that she find some way to combine her hobbies. One of my primary creative outlets involves combining my hockey fanaticism with my image-manipulation hobby. She should also look into joining a club or group of some kind, which would help fix interests in her mind."
3258,isfp,"Well, to be honest that dosen't sound very ISFP to me. But above that i think you guys have a wrong approach, for example i can't stick to do anything creative with a fixed schedule, the structure of having to go at some hour, some day, not beeing late, etc makes me feel that im doing a job and not having fun, and i need to play / have fun to be creative.
The post itself sounds like ""we HAVE to do something creative!"". What im trying to say here is ""let it flow"" ?
Like, try to see it like something fun, not like an obligation. What sounds weird to me is that she dosen't have something creative she likes doing, most ISFP's i know want to do all kind of creative stuff but don't have time or something.
I know im not helping with this answer since im not advicing in any hobbies or careers but i rly think this is the wrong approach (for example, a career is something full of test, responsabilities and stuff, is hard to enjoy it as a hobbie.
I play the guitar, the drums and i photoshop pictures, im bad at all of those but i still love doing it.
sorry for the bad grammar and poor english"
3259,isfp,"ENTP here.  Sensing types tend to make great illustrators but not great concept artists.   Very observant,  and the SF's are good at connecting their observation to an emotional experience,  but unless she's experienced it she won't intuit a novel idea.  
She needs to collect experiences before she can create something new.   As a Perciever she'll struggle with finishing what she starts (but you're a J  and can help her out there).  
She might also benefit from talking to an NP type. Or just do what we do: question all her assumptions about EVERYTHING, allow herself to explore what would happen if certain truths weren't true,  then imagine all the permutations and possibilities (this is where she'll have to draw from her experiences) to create something ""new"".  
The hardest part will be her questioning the emotion she's already tired to that experience,  but luckily she's a P and already operates in a sort of superposition.
Though I'm just shooting from the hip here."
3260,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and I can relate to what she is talking about. I have the desire to create but I have no idea what to make or what to do. Kinda funny, I used to play the flute too. I have no original ideas and I've learned to not let it bother me but I still want a way to express myself. Anyways, I've taken up zentangles. It's not something I do everyday but I find it interesting and its easy enough to do that you can leave it for months and then come back to it when you want to. From basic scribbles you can take it higher levels such as making one on a canvas and using water color pencils. I also find coloring very relaxing and it's an easy way to get your imagination going. Both are very inexpensive to take up and for zentangles there are so many free online resources or books you can buy to get the basic skills down.
edit: for coloring I print of blank mandalas and attack it with a pack of pencil crayons or colored sharpies."
3261,isfp,"I can relate, though I've never had it affect me so radically. Lately I've been in a writing slump, and have asked a writer group I'm a part of for motivation advice. I ended up not reading any of the like, 70+ responses because I realized, ""It'll happen"". Sometime I'll be in the mood to write and it'll happen. I picked up my sketchbook a few weeks back after a year+ of not doing any projects and busted two pieces out, and now I've put it away again.
For me, I will always have some subtle, background noise-type urge to create. Sometimes I look at it, and it's a super nova that might obliterate me. Other times it's a loaf of bread.
When I was growing up I had mandatory piano lessons and was supposed to practice at least once a day. I wanted to impress my teachers, so while I didn't practice every day I practiced a lot. It got me into the habit of just doing what I wanted to do. I thank my lucky stars for having a mom who put her foot down. ;)
Does she have any interest in learning other instruments? Perhaps something not in the wind/brass section? I have a laundry list of instruments. I'm currently learning xylophone/marimba and want to build a cajon soon."
3262,isfp,"About two years ago I started perling and I'm still at it. In fact I just made two pieces earlier this evening while watching Bering sea gold on Netflix haha. 
I like perling because its creativity and simplicity rolled into one. 
You can even make some money by selling beadsprites and beaded jewellery."
3263,isfp,"I think that both the creative desire and the inability to stay committed both seem like INFP traits.
I should have clarified that hobbies and careers have been two separate discussions... they just seemed to converge in this one letter. It would be great if she could find a hobby that would make money, but that isn't her ultimate goal. Basically, I think she just wants to find things that interest her for more than a few days."
3264,isfp,"True, but what seems 'weird' to me that she dosen't have the surge or interest in particular activities.
I agree with redduptheroom when he says ""We are experimenters. We need to experiment--play with it, massage it, work it. Things don't come out the first time.""
If its a hobby there is no problem to experiment with different activities, i think that at some point she might say ""i love doing this"" and feel no need to stick at one activity, just try until she likes one"
3265,isfp,"I think it depends on what type you are. Different types prioritise different things. For example, if you are Fe-dominant, you may be surprised to discover that the concern for keeping cohesiveness and the wellbeing of everybody in the group doesn't arise so much as the question, ""Does this work/feel right for me?"" Regardless of what the group might think of it, if that certain thing is important enough and in-keeping with what your values are.
That's kind of a huge generalisation and I admit I don't know much about MBTI functions. I'm extropolating based on what I've noticed and what I've heard online but that might be one of the key differences you would have noticed as an ISFP if you were Fe-dominant."
3266,isfp,"I have created a new subreddit to discuss MBTI and make new friends/meet new people.  If you are looking to chat with a certain type or just want to chat about anything and everything MBTI, this is the right place.  Anyone is welcome."
3267,isfp,"Sweet. 
I typically wanna dry myself off after a shower, but then I remember I‚Äôm an ISFP, so I cry for ten minutes about all the injustices in the world, decide to go backpacking through Europe for the next 6 months, spend a lot of alone time watching sunsets over Southern Spain by myself. Decide I miss my family, come home, spend time with them, then work a mundane boring job for the next few years, then get on Reddit and decide I need to go back out an explore again.
But that‚Äôs just me.
Then I dry myself off."

3269,isfp,"since you guys have se doesnt that mean meditation comes easily to you guys?,since se is all about being one with the moment?whats your experinces of this?,and does living in the moment make you happier?"
3270,isfp,"Well personally I suck at meditation. I seriously can't do it for more than a couple seconds. I think meditation is more for the high Ni types who constantly have to worry about everything, and meditation is a way for them to ground in the present. Since ISFPs technically do live in the present all the time, I don't think they need it that much. I could be wrong though... In my case, I live in the moment, but there are times where I just... tune out of the environment into myself. Like when if I'm doodling during a lecture for example. I might look like I'm spaced out, but somehow I'm still aware of what's being spoken about. I'm not sure whether that's Se, or Ni, or a mix of both... 
I'm not sure whether being in the moment makes me happier... because 'happier' is still relative to something. 'Happier' to what? Being content could probably be more accurate. I like being in the present, and being appreciative of moments and my surroundings. But at the same time, I also like having goals and having something to strive for, I feel. 
^...That ^actually ^kinda ^felt ^good ^to ^write ^out."
3271,isfp,"if i try and properly meditate i find it too hard to stay focused. for my ‚Äòtime of peace‚Äô i go on a long solo walk in nature. it allows my body to stay in rhythmic motion, and i can allow myself to get lost in my physical surroundings as i dive into my own thoughts. "
3272,isfp,"I'm not convinced that having a certain type trait makes anyone naturally better or worse at meditation. When I first tried meditation years ago, I literally couldn't sit alone with my thoughts for even 5 minutes, let alone 1. I remember feeling creeped out just trying to do it. 
In the span of about 3 years, i've finally found my rhythm. I was never consistent with it until now though. I recently challenged myself with a 30 day meditation challenge where I do 15 minutes as soon as I wake up and 15 minutes right before bed. Today is day 8 and just this week alone has been way more valuable towards my meditation ""skill"" than the sporadic, random meditation days I had in the past 3 years.
Living in the moment has significantly changed my life and made me happy; along with self love, more importantly. Once you realize that the only moment is NOW and you focus on what the present has, you'll let go of worry, stress, and anything else that can't be changed or benefit you."
3273,isfp,"What‚Äôs your type? I think dom-Ni types are actually happier living in the future, dom-se types are happier living in the present, and dom-si types are happier living in the past. Not everyone has to live in the present! Living in the future is actually useful for forward thinkers and people who prefer to make investments and delay gratification! And the good thing is, investing in the future always indirectly makes your present, better!
But sometimes dom-Ni will get into an Ni-Ti loop and analyse themselves into paralysis, which is perhaps where meditation can come in useful. But I find most times a good conversation with a friend is better for me to get out of my head, than strongwilling myself to do it through sheer force of will. When I‚Äôm focusing on someone else, I focus on myself less, and that‚Äôs good for me :)"
3274,isfp,"Whereas I don't like looking toward goals to push me forward. I just want to do things now and let that be the way it is. Looking towards goals always makes me feel like I'm tying to live in the future. I enjoy letting what is...just be. 
I've never tried meditation. It's not something I've ever felt I needed. To me, it feels more like wasted time. I should be doing something, living in the present. Not sitting there trying to empty my mind.  "

3277,isfp,"My introduction to Augustana (aside from Boston) was seeing them live a few years ago, in a small concert hall with less than 100 people. It was a super intimate setting. Holy crap does Dan Layus have an incredible voice. He was touring with Jay Barclay as a second guitarist. Jay and Dan just got this incredible cohesion going during Dust, and everyone was just so into it. The whole concert hall was just one unified soul for those 5 minutes. It is still by far the best live band experience I've had.
The downside is, now their recorded music feels pretty bland. Oh well."

3279,isfp,"I feel like people lump a few distinct groups into one group as hipsters now. People call me a hipster because I love coffee shops, writing, smoking my pipe, vinyl records, and older things such as typewriters. "
3280,isfp,"I think I hate the connotation of the term in modern American culture than the idea of being one. Simply because I am who I am and like what I like however I don't like the skinny jean I'm too cool/ the I don't like anything that goes mainstream mentality that I can't align with.  I'm on my phone sorry for the lack of structure and complete thoughts, I just be asked to put that much effort into it at the moment. "
3281,isfp,"I think it's like this, 
You know when a mother is carrying a kid upto her breast and the kid faces the opposite direction with respect to the way the mother is walking. Then you happen to be behind the mom and end up locking eyes with the kid. The kid has a weirded out look on its face and so do you. Then you don't know what to do, so you smile. Then the kid smiles back. That's how I feel about metaphors."
3282,isfp,Keep it short and sweet. If the metaphor drags on like it has to explain itself then it isnt a very good metaphor. If its done right though then its very satisfying to have another layer of understanding to the situation being explained. 
3283,isfp,In literature I sometimes find it tiring and pretentious to the point where the metaphor is doing more harm than good to describe the context. Subtleness is important. When a metaphore is done right and feels natural it can be pretty awesome. 
3284,isfp,"by no means an expert on mbti, also an isfp
introverted feeling (Fi) means there‚Äôs a special emphasis on emotions and feeling them viscerally, introverted intuition (Ni) means thoughts go on tangents on from one another and form connections with each other. for an isfp, Fi is your dominant function (the one you use most and identify with) and Ni is your tertiary (or third function, which is usually playing itself out in the background). extroverted sensing (Se) is your secondary function and works with your primary function to establish a foundation for your identity and outlook on a daily basis.
the Fi-Ni loop means that your secondary function is taking a backseat and your introverted feeling is interacting directly with your introverted intuition. while it‚Äôs good for self-reflection, when you‚Äôre in this state its really easy to be overly self-critical and harsh on yourself. without Se, the thoughts you‚Äôre having don‚Äôt really have any practical usage in reality- so your negative thoughts don‚Äôt have any rationale behind them, but the intensity of the emotions kind of leads you to believe that they do, and you‚Äôre stuck in this loop of emotions and thoughts that are being pulled from random places and it just wears you down
getting out of it usually means doing something physical or getting yourself grounded back into reality, however that might be. listening to an album you have a special connection with, exercising, going step by step and using your experiences to invalidate some of the bad thoughts, etcetc"
3285,isfp,"I never keep up to date with mainstream news. Reddit frontpage and RSS-feeds of tech-sites are my only source of news, except when the radio is on in a public place or something like that.
I just don't really care much about what happens on the other side of the world. Most of it just makes me sad or depressed because I can't really do much about anything that happens anyway. "
3286,isfp,no I don't actively follow the news. sometimes my family will talk about it and I'll here some news that way also sometimes I'll look at someone's newspaper and read some of it at work just because I'm bored not because I care.  
3287,isfp,"Hey peeps :3
I would love to hear of any relationship success as well as any pitfalls you have all experienced between you and an INFJ individual!
Just some background as to why I ask.
I is a textbook INFJ guy (Middling between F and T tho) and I met this almost textbook ISFP lady recently who is pretty enchanting and seems right for me since im a 2w3 (enneagram) so I have a feeling I would get the space I enjoy (Apparently you fluffy creatures like space too :D) as well as the above average amount of affection I desire while still getting to enjoy my occasional outdoorsy explorative hobbys. My last outing with her involved alot of physical contact like her holding my arm as we walked, legs touching, body language mimicry, etc which I really liked. Last relationship I had was with an incredibly affectionate INFP who ended up being not so incredible and cheated but the intense affection was perfect for me so Im hoping I can find that affection with a heaping pile of loyalty lmao.
Thank you in advance :) ""hugs"""
3288,isfp,"I'm an INFJ female married to an ISFP man. We do have some conflicts, as all couples do, but I really like being with a fellow introvert because we give each other the space we need. (edited because I initially put my husband's personality type incorrectly) "
3289,isfp,"I don't want to scare you off because all relationships are unique and your circumstances maybe very different. I hope it works out. I am an INFJ and I was with an ISFP for 4 years. We got engaged and I thought she was amazing. She then got mixed up with a bad group of friends and started behaving very differently. She use to be such a kindhearted person who would seem genuinely interested in me and showed her affection. Then she started becoming very loud and obnoxious the more she went out drinking with these friends who were a bad influence on her. She began thinking that she was a far better  person compared to her old self (the person I loved) and was even much better of a person than me, all because she had gained a ton of confidence and began acting out of character while I stayed true to myself. 
She began to look down on me saying how she has become so much better and out grew me as I was less outgoing and confident. I tried explaining to her that I had confidence and she was being judgmental (I have a ton of inner confidence in my abilities and I was very happy with myself). Just because I don't have a ton of friends who I like to go out drinking all the time with does not make me a lesser person. I'm just not a big drinker but I just prefer more time indoors working on projects or my Uni work, reading, and doing other fun activities with friends that does not have to include drinking to have a great time. I'm a social drinker but getting drunk does not mean the night was successful. I never could understand that attitude, anyway this is getting off topic, sorry! I go out to see a few friends now and again but I prefer having meaningful conversations and long walks. I don't understand why she changed so much. It was heartbreaking to experience. She would rather spend time with these people than me and we drifted apart.
In terms of pure INFJ and ISFP relationships in general, you may find it hard to relate at certain times because of your different ways at looking at a (possibly even shared) subject of interest. My ex often had the mindset of ""if it works then leave it alone"" or ""keep things how they are"" whereas I always wanted to theorize by trying to improve systems or processes (I'm explaining this from an abstract view) but she seemed so down to earth and not very ambitious or would get annoyed with me for not being practical enough. It's hard to explain but we would never see eye-to-eye. Back then though I did not understand much about MBTI and I wish I had known about these different mindsets earlier!"
3290,isfp,"See that sounds fantastic :DDD
I always give a ton of room to my partner since I need the room myself for my hobbies. Follow up question if you dont mind :)
So while I love space (Makes every reunion more lively and passionate) I like routine to some degree so I always send a ""good morning"" text and a ""Have a good lunch honey"" text. Think thats a thing that would annoy the common ISFP in your opinion? :P"
3291,isfp,"That's awesome to hear, thank you :D
Do you guys ever disagree because you both see things very differently? Maybe you can tell if you're disagreements can be chalked up to the difference between you being an intuitive while he is a sensor :3"
3292,isfp,"Wow that sounds like the kind of disaster my last relationship got into whoch ended up with my ex INFP cheating on me lol. It sounds like classic immaturity tho. Im a little old school and more practical in regular life. I keep my INFJ thoughts to myself and in my personal hobbies (studying Philosophy, Psychology, Political Science, Sociology)
Thank you for all your input and aorry that happened to you :_("
3293,isfp,"Thats perfectly fine as long as its not a bother. Just knowing she likes the effort is enough for me xD
I have one more inquiry, if you would be so kind :3
Any tell tale signs of an ISFP liking someone aside from classic indicators? Do they lean towards certain methods? :)
Anything you personally do when you like someone? xD
Thank you!"
3294,isfp,"I find little tokens or gifts, randomly and give them to certain people. I've been finding a lot of shells, marbles and neat buttons on my adventures lately. I'm not much for talking/writing, but I'll send people I like 'bits and bobs"" in the mail randomly. I hide notes and stuff for people to find later. "
3295,isfp,"I love my ISFP, but she often frustrates me because we make plans but then she flakes out at the last minute or ""can't be bothered"". Most days she wakes up and simply decides she wants to spend the day doing nothing instead of something. I feel like I'm the 'J' in our relationship (even though I'm INFP) and it's exhausting always being the one to initiate plans, especially when half of the time she ends up cancelling or making excuses. I love having stuff to look forward to but she doesn't really think about the future. Sometimes she'll come up with some really good ideas and I'll get all excited but then she doesn't ever make the effort to plan/save money etc so they never happen.
Also, I don't know how to deal with her when she feels sad or she's upset about something. Usually she goes really quiet and withdrawn, to the point I think I've done something to upset her. I ask her what's wrong but she doesn't tell me so I end up leaving her alone for a while. Usually she comes back to normal in the end, but I feel like the lack of communication means nothing ever gets solved. It's hard to tell her how I feel because she's sensitive and doesn't like to discuss serious issues.
So, ISFP's is there a way around these problems? I feel like we could be something special but I seem to be making twice the effort she does!"
3296,isfp,"First, every people is different. 
Now, as an isfp, I can totally relate to her but I think it doesnt mean that its an isfp thing to do. Anyways, 
Im fixing this part of me. Im trying to communicate more of my feelings especially towards my SO. I regret doing this. One of the reasons is that I cant properly say my problem to my SO without making her mad. When we talk, i forgot some things or Ill say a different one that is not what I meant to say. 
Maybe she has a different type of effort. I feel anxious when talking to people on a specific scenario (authority figures and such) but I make myself more dependable on situations like that with my SO which takes a lot of psychological effort in me. 
This is normal in my life. Especially beside my SO. I actually (jokingly)  ask permission if I could day dream while she do something else. Im glad she also likes staying at home. 
Ive had my fare share of events like this and we end up quarreling.

The best way I think is calmly talk to her. Point out your problems. She'll probably get stubborn but hopefully make it grow on her. Unfortunately, I only contemplated on it when we broke up ( I was sensitive and end up not listening/forgetting her problems about me, then it built up). Hopefully it wont happen to both of you. wish you luck!"
3297,isfp,"This all sounds familiar. I wouldn't say it's a bad thing when we withdraw, to me that's how I move past the problem.  I just go into my own world and look at all the facts, remove my biases (as best a person can), and figure out how I really feel. In there I can admit where I'm wrong and really flesh out that idea and understand the full situation. Moving forward from that I prefer not to talk about things (although sometimes I have to), but instead to just try and do better in the direction I decided.
As for the not wanting to do anything, I get that, but it really depends on the day. I go through phases where I'm just not down to really interact with anyone. In those times I just like doing stuff at home with my close circle or by myself.
I dont know how you can deal with it but hopefully I gave you some insight. Anyway good luck, bud."
3298,isfp,"Talk to her about it. This seems incredibly obvious, but believe me, it is necessary. The key though is how you go about it. Expressing yourself in a cross or even angry tone is repelling, so you have to be as calm and reasonable as you can while accurately illustrating your frustrations.
I know this sounds like a tall order, but trust me. The best approach I can offer is explaining that last-minute absenteeism just leaves you confused, frustrated, maybe even hurt. If you can make them sympathize or even empathize with you, your message should come through.
As an ISFP, I myself have some pretty strong urges to just shirk responsibilities or social obligations and go be Henry David Thoreau somewhere. Don't take it personally, it's probably not a case where they couldn't care less about you...I hope. Chances are they're just caught up in their own thing.
Just talk to her, see how it goes. It's clear you want to discuss it to make things better, and hopefully she'll hear you out."
3299,isfp,"Well, the dominant Fi and inferior Te in both could result in lack of assertion or the needed push to do things. Just a thought. I tend to rely on others when it comes to planning and would prefer to do things on the moment instead saving it for later, I guess."

3301,isfp,"Those songs aren't catchy.......... U sure u ISFP? 
Just wondering your account is a day old.
Why is this down voted? Just so you know ISFP don't find the need to down vote and mostly thinks it's a waste of time.
Must be the INFP's"
3302,isfp,"So what you're saying is that you are looking for a playlist with any and all catchy songs ever written. There are loads of songs a lot of people agree on as being catchy, but whether it's ""good catchy"" or ""bad catchy"" is subjective and differs widely.
Mentioning genres was a way to try to narrow down that incredibly long list of variating tracks. "
3303,isfp,"Exactly! Which means that you're asking anybody coming in here to post any fucking song based on their preferences in hopes of you finding it catchy or not.
Just sign out and don't come back, your attempt at trolling is neither fun nor has it been successful."
3304,isfp,"Graduation for highschool is coming up, and I have two ISFP male friends - one is musically-inclined, the other is really sporty. I was thinking of making handmade personalized pop-up cards, with writings about our best memories together etc. but do ISFPs like them? I read that guys prefer practical stuff and hate handmade stuff, so I was thinking of buying chocolate instead. Thoughts? "
3305,isfp,Also why am i picturing you as an anime girl in a love triangle with both guys fighting for your heart? One guy is your sensitive musical childhood friend and the other a firey sports guy. Which one will win???
3306,isfp,"I prefer practical stuff (if I don't have gloves for winter, giving me some gloves will make you an attentive person and I love that), but if you're artsy, make something that you know that ISFP will like."
3307,isfp,"I personally would love to receive a gift like that. It really shows you care about them and have a lot of great memories including them. It's not just a handmade gift, it's a handmade gift which serves as a tangible reminder of your experiences together.
ISFP-wise, I think 'the artist' type would appreciate the artistic effort that went into making the cards, enjoying looking at the little details you included.
(and there's no reason you couldn't include chocolate too)"
3308,isfp,"My brother is an ENTP and we get into a lot of debates, from the smallest things (I tell him knob is broken, he tells me it's not, I tell him I just tested, he says he used it and its fine, I tell him go and test it, he says it must be this and that) to really serious things (I advise him not to take a full load of classes this semester at uni, he tells me he signed up for the easy ones, I tell him it will still eat up his time, he tells me he can do this and that). He often debates me to death and will not accept being the wrong person in the conversation and will try to find loop holes so that he can emerge as the victor. He even twists my words sometimes and claims I said something that I didn't, and will claim that the context in how I said it was misleading, that's why I'm wrong. 
Despite all of that, I love my brother and he's a good companion. I never had difficulties asking him to do errands. He agrees to go with me whenever I need help doing something. He is loved by many of his friends. We have so many inside jokes. We enjoy watching movies together and talking about it afterwards. He's one of my closest friends and he tolerates me when I want to relax and act like we are kids again (water pistol fight, playing games with our dog, running around the house like crazy, etc). Plus, I must admit, he is intelligent. I just hate how I lose logical arguments with him :P"
3309,isfp,I have always wanted to meet an ENTP. I think we would get along great...I am into ENTJs but there's just something too different about them for us to ever perfectly mesh. I wonder if that would be fixed with a J to P switch.
3310,isfp,"never met one either! we're too quiet and we don't get noticed by them. I imagine that we'd get intimidated by them. Ni is slow and Ne is fast, which would probably make us look stupid/ boring to them. Quicksilver from the recent X-Men movies (Evan Peters) and Tyrion from GOT reminds me of what ENTPs would be like. I actually had a crush on Quicksilver and Tyrion, too."
3311,isfp,"Because Ne would be too fast for Ni in conversation. I don't know about other Ni users, but I'm more comfortable with writing because I organize my thoughts better that way. Everything flows and centers around a core when I'm writing. Ne feels like lightning to me (sister is Ne) and Ni feels like a deep pit. Speaking with an Ne would just make me look stupid because I wouldn't be able to catch up. It's a weak point. ENTPs like witty, clever quips and a fast pace. Some ISFPs can provide that, but this one can't really. "
3312,isfp,"""I can't make a decision, there are too many possibilities and too much uncertainty right now.""
""There are too many things to think of, I can't organize it all in my brain!""
""I'd rather not make a decision unless I know its 100% true. It's easy to make promises, but you can't always follow through""
""Sorry I didn't respond earlier, I was playing (insert instrument)/(doing X artistic activity)

3316,isfp,"So first time I took the MBTI test I scored INTJ. Then I joined reddit and was prompted to take it again. A month after first test I took it three more times. Each time was INTP. It's been about three months and I just took it again and scored ISFP. I feel very similar to the people here but still a little off. When I read ISFP vs INTP I find myself feeling very similar to both but missing one or two points here and there. Are there things you would say that would determine a difference between the two?

3317,isfp,"The only way I could figure mine out is objectively looking at myself and how I interact with people in real life. Asking internet people to type you is just going to fuck up your shit. Plus there are a lot of people on here who hate Ss and Fs, so you might wrongly lean towards NT if you don't think you're a complete retard."
3318,isfp,"I'd recommend reading up on both and seeing which one reflects you best. I had a very similar situation, and actually found that just hanging around both subreddits was a guys indicator. The posts from one of them were a lot more jarring than the other... "
3319,isfp,"I used to mistype as an INFJ when I was younger. I honestly don‚Äôt know much about mbti, but younger me thought I was more principled than I am, had not yet tried an artistic medium that spoke to me and had not really gone through any tests in life that made me realize what is truly important to me (family, being able to support the ones I love, being able to have time for myself). I‚Äôm more practical and less idealistic than I would have admitted when I was younger. no idea if any of that is helpful."
3320,isfp,"With a really basic glance at the code dichotomies, I typed myself as an INFJ. When I‚Äôm really depressed, I relate even more to INFJ. Online tests usually type me as ENFP but that never seemed right. After looking at the functions and learning about them, I‚Äôm definitely an ISFP. 
I can see how a sad PrincessBloom looks like an INFJ because I get stuck in my head and worry about what people think and what I should do, and pretty much everything so I try to be more prepared. I can also see how a happy and healthy PrincessBloom looks like an ENFP because I‚Äôm fairly social for an introvert and I really love new experiences and individualist values are always important to me. 
Since learning about the functions, I recognize that Fi is definitely my frame of reference and I‚Äôve realized how big of an influence Se has on me. I love novelty and love new things. I think this is why I am typed as an Ne sometimes because they also love novelty. But I relish and crave sensory experiences more than ideas and I love to experience new things and then think about them later and process what I learned and what it might mean or how I can use it. I‚Äôm also really active and being active, especially outdoors, makes me happy and really helps center me. 
I think ISFPs have a bad reputation for being stupid, shallow, and self-righteous, but that doesn‚Äôt bother me too much because I don‚Äôt take it seriously. I think most people really into the MBTI are in a self-crisis, at least I was when I got into it and the better I feel, the less I think about it. I also think the stereotypes against ISFP are tossed around by unhealthy people making unhealthy judgments or they are people who have poorly developed emotional intelegence and refuse to see any value in emotions and claim to only be logical thinkers who are immune to emotional bias, even though they are making judgments about other types off of their own emotional bias. A lot of the stereotypes about ISFPs aren‚Äôt true or they are exaggerated. Such is life. 
Are you an ISFP who mistyped as an INFJ? Are you an INFJ who is considering they might be an ISFP but they are reluctant to admit it? Would you be disappointed to be an ISFP? If yes, why do you think that is? "
3321,isfp,"I always tested as an INFJ when I was younger, but since taking the test again as part of a project, I was consistently ISFJ/ISFP. I'm slightly more perceiving, but could really go either way. 
Similar to what pgf said, I've become more practical and went through difficult situations in life as I got older. I think growing up and having work experience, having to pay bills, etc brought out my sensing side. Going through school K-12 and then college requires more intuition, but in the working world, I think sensing is used more often. My preferences just changed as my experiences changed, and I adapted to my environment."
3322,isfp,"This paragraph: ""I think ISFPs have a bad reputation for being stupid, shallow, and self-righteous, but that doesn‚Äôt bother me too much because I don‚Äôt take it seriously.

Plus quite a number of isfps dont fit the stereotypes and can seem like other types as well. Especially that ""shallow"" trait makes isfps look like they exist just to have fun or they never think deep at all. 
Lol i never got asked back a question, that's a nice changeüòÑ
Yeah i once mistyped as infj and i think there are a number of reasons to why there are mistypes for isfps on this, one of them being an isfp with a better developed intuition. Besides your enneagram plays a part, and the understanding of cogfuncts and your self awareness etcetc. 
I have met isfps who really are sensor like and dont think deep, but have also met others who really seem like intuitives.
Im an isfp and with all the negative sensor bias flying around, and the vibes that Ns are more rare and sensors are found all over the place and under rocks just makes me feel like im nothing. I guess thats why many sensors not only isfps mistype. Sensors only like concrete facts and are practical, unable to think of ideas or research without the need for application and many many more. But really isfps are more than this, and it doesnt help that we are stamped with a ""dumb"" on our foreheads when many are capable of so much more. Plus the isfp itself is a lazy, worrisome, low energy, anxious, always second-guesses, prone to sadness kind of type. Sometimes i feel i should step it up while others are so successful, and im here reading harry potter books even when the movie and the magic is over. It's like im reluctant to go back to reality. "
3323,isfp,"I wouldn‚Äôt say sensors don‚Äôt think deeply. I think that is an unfair suggestion. Everyone has other functions that involve thinking and it‚Äôs not just intuition. Just because someone leads with sensing, doesn‚Äôt say anything about their depth. I think assuming so is just perpetuating the stereotype. Also dealing with the pure theoretical is not aomehow superior to dealing with concrete facts or tangible applications and it has nothing to do with ‚Äòdeep thinking‚Äô or intelegence. I think it is an interest thing. I can discuss hypothetical situations and abstract concepts for a while but I‚Äôm not really interested in spending a lot of time doing so unless it has some kind of purpose. I like the physical world and I view the world through a material lens. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I can‚Äôt inagine the future or play with ideas, but if it doesn‚Äôt impact a person‚Äôs material condition or lived experience or have some sort of application for the greater good,  it won‚Äôt hold my interest for too long. I like learning and collecting information, but I‚Äôm still always thinking about how I might use this information because I like seeing ideas become realized. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm incapable of researching something that doesn‚Äôt have a practical application, I always google things I don‚Äôt know out of curiosity and entertainment.  I just won‚Äôt spend my time chasing ideas and information that won‚Äôt materialize because the end isn‚Äôt worth the means, in my opinion. I don‚Äôt think that makes me less intelligent than other people. I‚Äôm rewarded when my senses are stimulated so I obviously would like to pursue ideas that will give the dopamine hits My brain enjoys oh so much. I know you‚Äôre saying that ISFPs are more, but so are all types with strong emphasis on sensing. 
I don‚Äôt think MBTI is meant to be taken too seriously. Your type shouldnt define you or what you can or cannot do. One type isn‚Äôt better than another. Every type has strengths and weaknesses and it sucks that some strengths are not valued the same way as others and I think that does end up with people pigeon holing ISFPs but i think then ISFPs should know better than to make arbitrary judgments on functions. 
I think my Fi is getting the better of me. Sensing it awesome. It makes the world truly pleasurable and sometimes excruciating but there is always value in it. I wish people would just embrace it unapologetically. Sensors of the world unite! "
3324,isfp,"I was lying in bed a few weeks ago trying to fall asleep. It was very early (or late I suppose?), about 5:30am. I was in a blank, empty sort of mood. Then I noticed the way the early morning light was coming through my window and curtains, and the type of shadow that it cast on the wall. I felt really uneasy and I realized that for some reason that cold blue light and the shadows on the wall made me feel something very dark and painful. I don't know why but it made think of a girl who had a hard life, suffered a lot, and then committed suicide. This isn't a real girl by the way, the light and shadows just made this story pop into my head. It really made me sad though, I teared up a little thinking about it. I really felt attached to this made up shadow girl so I kind of just lay there feeling gloomy for a while. Then I got up and made a tea and forgot about it.  
This kind of stuff happens to me all the time, and I don't really mind it. I kind of like it actually, these weird little feelings aren't necessarily negative all the time. Sometimes it's a more happy story or feeling!

3328,isfp,"I've been told this recently by my parents and my boss/coworkers that I need to be more angry in life. Basically I'm too nice and forgiving to people, and having this personality is letting things happen that to me are minor details, but to my family and peers I am just giving myself up too easy in trying to please everyone and make others and myself happy.
Examples: 
I recently closed on a co-op apartment, and in the process the bank lawyer messed up and sent important documents to the wrong address. In my mind, people make stupid mistakes, and the problem was being resolved by the lawyer, so I was more or less calm about the situation. My mom however was fuming at the fact that he fucked up and delayed things even further, and possibly letting personal information out in the world  (it was not). She told me I'm too nice and need to be angry. 
And at work, we had some job position changes and I had an opportunity to get a position that's a bump up from what I usually do(think lower manager upgraded to higher manager). 
However after discussed with my colleague, I conceded to stay at my usual job to maintain work quality overall at the ground level, and give the higher position to him because I know I'm a better lower manager. Other coworkers came up to me and say I was 'bullied' into staying at the lower manager position, and that I should be angry. 
So yeah, has anyone else been told they need to be angrier? I don't have it in me because that's not who I am, however feeling good about something at one time and regretting it later is getting old. 
Tell me I'm not crazy."
3329,isfp,"I've had this happen to me, and it makes me more mad than the thing they're saying I should be mad about, haha.
I'm not suppressing my anger, I'm not being a doormat or letting people walk over me. I just honestly don't care or I'm over it. It doesn't feel good to me to hold onto anger that I find unnecessary. When I'm actually angry, I will be angry. And when I'm not I don't want to be."
3330,isfp,"Yes! I grew up playing soccer and field hockey. I was often told I was ""too polite"" to the opposition and needed to be more aggressive. I quit in high after realising it wasn't for me and I would get anxious every Saturday before my games."
3331,isfp,"I've been called out by my girlfriend at the time. I forgot about what things specifically, but she wouldn't understand why I wouldn't get angry. 
Much like your examples, it didn't make sense for me to get angry as 1. things are out of my control (and/or staying angry would be counterproductive) and 2. there doesn't seem to be much damage done (lawyer), 3. you are comfortable with your decision to stay at your current responsibility level."
3332,isfp,"I think a better word for it would be ""assertive"". Don't be a doormat! Of course, that also applies to the people who told you to be angry in the first place: if you're not angry, then you're just not. If anything you sound a lot more rational and realistic than them. It's likely they assumed you would want the higher position. A warning: people might rile you up just for the sake of trying to get a reaction from you. "
3333,isfp,"When my son does something wrong on purpose and he says ""oh sorry mom"" and say ""it's ok""... then my intp husband says ""no it's not on (and proceeds to lecture him on what he did wrong and providing examples and reasoning for correcting the behavior""... so yea, he says I need to stop being such a pushover."
3334,isfp,"This is so relatable. I've read that wanting peace in ones immediate environment is a very ISXP thing, and having that peace disturbed makes us confused and agitated, and so we'd do whatever we can to maintain it, even when inconvenient. 
Alternately, we look at people first then performance? Hence our lack of 'anger issues' :p Going by an Fi stream, how can I expect to be extended any consideration if I am not willing to be considerate and understanding? If we let mistakes define us none of us would act righteous enough to complain. But we're not righteous, and so we don't let mistakes define everyone. If we did, the inevitable self analysis would make us feel like hypocrites :p "
3335,isfp,"Well it's important to mention that my husband was raised by an ESFJ mother. Before we had children he was very very chill and never got upset about anything. He is still very chill but can be triggered into disciplinarian mode if he HAS to.
I can't think of an example off the top of my head, but it's usually something like ""we told u not to touch that thing/ do that thing and u did it anyway and that caused u to get hurt or made a mess, etc..."".
I'm an ISFP raised by an unhealthy ESFP so I didn't get a healthy level of discipline and rules growing up. I'm way too relaxed and have had to learn to put on a tough front for the kids so they grow up to respect us.
Basically my husband as an INTP thinks about the past, present, and future and what can happen based on choices we make in every day moments. The wheels in his head are always turning and I've learned to follow his lead, because he always ends up being right."
3336,isfp,"You're a rare breed. It's not crazy to not be angry, it's much better for everyone that you don't fit in that sense. Angry people also want to drag you down with them, and they think you're weird or naive because they can't really make you resentful."
3337,isfp,"For the most part I'm pretty happy person on the outside, but when somethings bothering me it's very obvious. I usually stop talking and get a resting bitch face going, and it'll sit for a while until someone makes me laugh and then I forget it happened at all. It's a weird thing as it feels like an outer body experience."
3338,isfp,"This makes me feel like I'm not an INTP
I've seen ENTPs do this before (and once or twice with other INTPs) but I can't imagine myself ever doing this
What do you mean by doing something wrong on purpose?"
3339,isfp,"Also, it's kind of funny how my INTP husband talks to our 4 year old as if he is a grown up. When he is upset with him, he fully explains how he is feeling and why he feels that way and tells him how and why he should correct his behavior. It seems to be working because everyone who ever talks to our son says he speaks so well and has better speech than many 6 year olds they know. He also recently was accepted to a gifted and talented school."
3340,isfp,"Don't like labels and refuse to let some test tell me who I am.
But damn the amount of INTJs is huge and it bothers me. These test results make me feel so alone. And society doesn't exactly make it easy to live as this sort of ""type,"" if I ever see a thread where this stuff comes up I can never see isfps.
whatever, not like it's real."
3341,isfp,"Speaking purely from personal experience, it seems a lot of people like to disguise themselves as INTJs. It's not hard to sway the results of a test; as long as you can recognize the purpose of the questions, you can fix the results.
Anywho, regardless of whether you believe in it or not, there's people out there who you can definitely relate to. They may be few and far between, but they're out there. Just take your time and look for them. :)"
3342,isfp,I think it's just INTJs are more likely to use reddit and occupy online forums.  Most ISFPs I know don't really have any desire to.  Statistically we're supposed to outnumber them but not to sure where people get these stats from.
3343,isfp,"The test has value as long as you don't let it become an excuse for negative behaviour. I don't believe that the MBTI system is fool-proof in any way, but I believe it has a lot of potential to help. The only way to truly get the help imo is to learn the whole system and figure out where you really fit in and what it means; where the system's boundaries are. I find the tests extremely flawed, of course they'll give some people accurate answers on the first try, but for myself I always tested as an intuitive type and this really hindered my  comprehension of all of it for a while."
3344,isfp,"I always wonder if there are objective truths of the cognitive functions that are embedded into our brain somewhere. Like someday we'll figure out an actual construct for personality theory based on actual brain data but for now it's all just speculation. The biggest takeaway I've gotten from looking into this stuff is communication with other types of people.
The shittiest thing though is not being able to unlearn this stuff and seeing it everywhere. I wish I could not think about it and just take people for who they are without my meaningless psycho-bullshit."
3345,isfp,"The theory is sound, the test is bullshit. It's based on stereotype, so a lot of people like the ""special snowflake"" feeling of the INTP and INTJ forums, and a lot of them think ""logical"" = NT. 
Anyway, this test is just a predictor of patterns. It doesn't show you who you are, but in a way it does predict the fact that you'd say that. It's a very SF idea.
[ISTP]"
3346,isfp,"I think the most important thing to remember when it comes to MBTI is that it is not a personality type but a preference type. (ie how you prefer to handle conflict or problems)
I'm an ISFP and I usually avoid conflict like the plague because I try to keep my life peaceful and calm. If it must be addressed I prefer compromise as much as possible otherwise, honestly, I blow up and let my feelings and emotions take control and get the better of me. My bf on the other hand is an INTJ and he will bring up the issue straight away, very bluntly, without much regard to anyone's feelings and will talk about it nonstop until he feels it has been resolved. (It's nauseating and exhausting lol) Also it's extremely unlikely that he will compromise. 
Again, its just a preference. I know some people take comfort in finding a place or group of people they can connect with or are similar to. MBTI cannot and will not define who everyone is. I think more than anything it's just fun to find out what type a person falls into and how much they do show those traits. :)"
3347,isfp,"Yes, this. Im part of the ESFP sub and theres only like 500 peeps on it. Similarly, i tend to only browse during work hours... In my free time, i tend to be outside somewhere.. :)
Like, right now im on reddit, but im actually waiting for my mates to rock up so we can go out haha"
3348,isfp,"i'm and INTP and there's at least 5 posts a day on our subreddit. i think that our ""question everything"" and our ""keep on learning"" nature kind of goes with that. we like to talk to other like minded people, and i think we really are very logical, so we probably tend to talk about things more. and again, getting insight from people who think like us probably helps."
3349,isfp,"Making extreme assumptions or judgement calls for me. It‚Äôs hard to explain but whenever someone does that, there‚Äôs this dark, brutal part of me that‚Äôs hurting and wants to lash out at them for even thinking of it. Like what makes you think you know me so much better than myself that your autonomy extends over mine? Usually it‚Äôs just acquaintances/classmates/guys I don‚Äôt know doing this."
3350,isfp,"Lately less and less things piss me off, but something that still works is mocking or hating on something I like. Just saying it is shit isn't enough, but doing it in a satirical/sarcastic tone really pisses me off."
3351,isfp,"

People who always have to control and micro-manage. Correcting things that aren't even wrong. Cleaning things that aren't even dirty.


People whose main hobby is judging people, spreading rumors, and slowly cutting down the people around them.

"
3352,isfp,"Not giving me space when I need it, expecting an immediate response when I need time to think. Typical introversion. 
Lately I've also been more prone to conflict with people who violate my morals (which imo are pretty standard). Can't stand it when a person say steals something and then brags about getting away with it."
3353,isfp,this doesn't really piss me off but it still irks. but when i hang out with someone and they plan out the entire day with exact set times we need to do things by is kinda annoying i feel like i don't have a lotta time to just chill out and breathe without feeling rushed to do sumthn else ya know?
3354,isfp,"We've been in an LDR for 2 years and 3 months now because we're both in college. It's been an amazing experience but anything but perfect, despite the rough times though it feels just meant to be. We think differently in so many ways but can still be very understanding to each other and get passed rough times(which are usually silly anyways). She's an -T and I'm an -A, not sure if it's to blame or not, but I'm usually required to dig through her emotions in order for her to open up to bring light to the rough times we have. I know that it's much more stressful for her than me to wait so long to be together for real, but I don't think anything can really pull us apart. We even have different religious beliefs(none for me) and that hasn't affected our relationship much. Our relationship has been a roller coaster of fighting emotions but feels oh so worth it.
If I had any advice to give, don't let their complaints stress you out. It always comes from the heart and normally all I need to calm down is a feeling of acknowledgement/understanding. Nothing stresses me out more than feeling like that's missing. Also be care of how you personally interpret their tone, that's often a source of miscommunication for us."
3355,isfp,"Thanks for the advice! Yes im trying to be understanding with the complaining. I think im getting better at it. He complains oh so much! We‚Äôve been married for 4 years. I‚Äôm more social than he is, and i can understand how its harder for her, to be apart. Sometimes i feel like he doesnt need me (maybe that‚Äôs true? ISFP IS the benefactor to INFJ in socionics, after all), and his time alone to recharge is usually longer than mine. I‚Äôve learnt not to take it personally, to give him space, and busy myself with other things. It helps when he‚Äôs not the only source of support i have. So i try to keep my social life alive, outside of the relationship. Sometimes i feel like an extrovert, in comparison to him XD"
3356,isfp,"I think we complain a lot because we want to be as genuine and honest about our emotions as possible. We hate that it causes stress but it really can't be helped, being understood and connected is everything. If he is in need of recharge time, maybe he's a more of the turbulent type?
It's really hard to explain what my clinginess is like. But the best way to explain it is that if my girlfriend starts to detach herself a little, often not consciously, I'm going to be bothered by and point out the changes right away. I know it can be confusing, but he probably needs you much more than you think, it's just that we both have very different ways of expressing it. For me it's like there's a Goldilocks zone for how much attachment I'm in need of‚Äîand maybe if you remember what you were like together when you first started dating or the earlier days of marriage, it's probably what he'll still prefer.
Yes, of course you're an extrovert in comparison, that's what INFJs are known for. I talk to almost no friends, while she is very attached and affectionate to her friends. Normally I don't mind it at all as long as I still feel like a priority. It's not that friends and other people aren't important to me, it's just that when I leave my heart out for someone, my attentiveness lives with that person.
But, perhaps unavoidable, sometimes your mood and behaviors will change at times without you being aware of it. He could be very sensitive to that and you will be really confused about what's bothering him haha. If you're ever confused like that, just try to take a step back and analyse each of your behaviors. Then maybe you can reassure him that everything's fine, without these little things being blown out of proportion!
I'm sorry he complains so much. Just keep in mind, it's likely just him being open about all his thoughts and opinions. If he doesn't have much to talk about, that's all he has to fall back on. Even if it obviously isn't important, never point that out because he may take it as his feelings not being important. Likely it won't be a serious matter to him, it's just his thoughts coming out, so never feel like it's a personal attack from him. I think harmony is all that's on our minds, basically. It's very difficult to keep our different ways of thinking in that harmony, no doubt!"
3357,isfp,"INFP here, I find Fi aux to be much more excitable then Fi doms. Fi doms have a tendency to be more expressive, withdrawn, and perhaps genuine. Would you say that it is more difficult to predict trends or get something accomplished?"
3358,isfp,"Fi aux are more adept at using Te, compared to Fi dom, who have inferior Te. This translates to ENFP and ESFP being more proactive and on the go (Ne/Te, Se/Te), compared to INFP and ISFP, who have a tendency to self-ruminate (Fi/Ni, Fi/Si)."
3359,isfp,"Whoa, this is really true for me.
Not this, though."
3360,isfp,"Not sure if anyone has ever posted this link here before but I found it somewhat comforting in a time of severe turmoil within myself.
Anyone on here ever tried to focus on developing their ""Sensing"" in a extroverted and healthy/mindful way?"
3361,isfp,"So, I‚Äôm fairly okay with my body. I would also say I‚Äôm fairly fit - I walk a lot and play football at a casual level sometimes. But I do notice I‚Äôm slimmer than most men my age, and some added weight/muscle would be more than welcome - For my own happiness as well as some added confidence I suppose.
However, as an ISFP, the monotonous routine of working out just sucks. I can never stick to it. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm not even all that passionate about it.
So I wanted to know what works for you, and If you have any tips/methods for sticking with it. Cheers!"
3362,isfp,"Honestly, I suck at cardio, but I‚Äôve learned that I really like strength training. I basically only do lower body stuff because I notice progress much faster (I‚Äôm female) and it‚Äôs just kind of like a competition with myself, seeing how much farther I can push myself each time. I definitely need to do some upper body stuff though:/.
But yeah. Try to compete with yourself. Try to choose activities that you enjoy, and constantly focus on even your tiny little improvements, in strength, appearance, endurance, whatever. Also, find good music. And try to keep your music new so you don‚Äôt get bored. Go hiking or something if you can. Idk lol."
3363,isfp,"Get two workout buddies. I would never go by myself. Having a group of three people keeps everyone honest, and even if one person flakes you have another person to go with. Its also hard to justify not going when two other people are going. Started doing this last like October, and have been to the gym three or four days a week ever since."
3364,isfp,"Ive been struggling to find a regular routine for a couple of years. Before my goal used to be to exercise so I can look better. I didn't like going to the gym cause I found it boring personally. However I found this subreddit called r/bodyweightfitness and they have a very good Reccomemded Routine. Its simple and you can do the workouts at home if you have a pull up bar. I started working out to feel better and to get stronger, increase stamina, mobility etc and that has been motivating me more rather than working out to look better as seeing the progress of my abilities improving has helped me working consistently rather than working out to look good. Also listening to podcasts whilst working out makes time fly, but someone already mentioned that :). Good luck and keep at it! "
3365,isfp,"Limit your workouts to an hour or less, then it won't be as boring, and it will go by a lot faster! Also, make a workout playlist. And think of it as a lifestyle, don't expect results after 1 or 2 weeks. Results come slow. And even more slow the more advanced you become. You have to learn to enjoy working out. Feel the mind-muscle connection. Feel the pump. Imagine being the muscle. Also, when drinking your protien, imagine your muscles absorbing all that goodness. And after your workouts, take a nice warm shower and feel your muscles loosen and relax. And when you go to bed, feel your muscles recovering and growing stronger and more powerful. "
3366,isfp,"Thankyou, I appreciate it! I think the focusing on tiny improvements is a good one - I kinda get disheartened and put off when I think about how much hard work it really takes to improve. I kinda just weigh it up and think, is it really worth it? But that‚Äôs an issue with me personally and I should absolutely work past that.
But you have some good tips on making it enjoyable, which would be a big help. Cheers!"
3367,isfp,"Absolutely! Yeah, just take it day by day. Make smaller goals rather than focusing on the big picture. I‚Äôm never going to look like, say, a Kardashian, no matter how hard I work, so it can be disheartening when we compare ourselves to some kind of ultimate ideal. Focus on little things, like completing more reps than last time, and how good you feel once your heartbeat has camped after a hard workout. I remember being super excited when I first saw a tiny bit of muscle definition in my thighs, or seeing my veins pop out of my wrist a little. Try not to focus so much on the long term!!"
3368,isfp,"I'm scared and worried, yes, because i have been depressed with self harm episodes (not very bad luckily) and i'm scared to do something that makes me fall there again. I'm scared to the point i avoid situations where i can fail, approaching a girl because of rejection, bad grades on exams (i can't avoid exams so when i have finals i get anxious and stressed), i guess i have to live with it,"
3369,isfp,"Yeah.. I have a tendency to avoid a lot of situations where I could potentially feel stressed and overwhelmed. I would sometimes call out of work because I was having anxiety . I overthink it when really it‚Äôs not that bad. It‚Äôs kinda like waiting in line for a rollercoaster and being scared and panicky the whole time waiting , but once you get in and it starts moving, it becomes more real and your mind worries a little less. And by the time the ride is over you realize it wasn‚Äôt that terrifying and actually pretty fun! 
Maybe that makes sense.. I‚Äôm not one to come up with illustrations haha "
3370,isfp,"Just curious about how types interact with each other. My best friends tend to be ISFJ especially, INFP, ENFP, ESFP and sometimes ENFJ. How do you get along and what do you love most about each other?"
3371,isfp,"My best friend is INTP with a little bit of INFP in him. I'm IxFP.. 50/50 ISFP/INFP. We get along great, I can talk to him about literally anything. We've been bros since sophomore year in high school when he started dating my friend, and we had similar musical interests (radiohead primarily) and ever since then we've been total bros. He's like a brother to me in the fact that I can tell him anything and he gets it, ya know. For our senior trip at the end of high school we spent a month in Europe and one of those weeks in Amsterdam and it was totally surreal. We've been roommates since 2011 and we've never come to a disagreement or argument on anything. It's fucking great and I love him to death."
3372,isfp,"INFP here, I was creeping my besties type subreddit and stumbled upon this post it was interesting to find that most of you ISFP's team up with INFP's too. I love her to death and we've been inseparable since high school. Before I started dating my ENFP boyfriend in first year we really only hung out with each other, he forced us to leave the house and meet people, ugh (just kidding.. kind of). The only thing about is when anything goes wrong it's so hard for her to look past the bleak present into the possibilities of the good that could come in the future. But the's what I'm here for to show them to her and cheer her stuck on the negative ass up."
3373,isfp,"Mostly ENFP and a couple of INFPs.  With my ENFP friends I'm usually accompanying them on some grand adventure, which I love because I probably would never do one by myself.  I usually take a supporting role with ENFPs and sort of act like an emotional pillar to them.  I love how great ENFPs are with people in ways that I can never manage to be, haha.
With my INFP friends, we are sort of like mind bros.  Since our cognitive functions are so similar, we think in really similar ways.  We just sort of end up...brooding and talking about the world a lot.  I love how philosophical and dreamy INFPs are, since I'm much more practical minded.
And not really my best friend, but I'm dating an ENTJ right now.  It's very interesting being in a totally opposites relationship.  Seems kinda weird but I appreciate how he's everything I'm not!"
3374,isfp,"I'm an INFP and one of my best friends is an ISFP. Someone else on this thread stated that we feel like ""mind bros."" This is absolutely true. For the most part we enjoy doing and feel similar about a lot of things, but how we perceive and enjoy them is completely different. But with that difference, we can explain to each other really well and get how the other person feels and why so very easily. We can kind of exist side by side for hours on end whether or not we're engaged in the same activity and talk about how we feel about this and the other thing. 
One thing I never realized until now is that we can either talk a myriad of subjects in one evening or primarily one or two for hours on end. I'd imagine we can stay on track if we're both discussing something that activates our Fi, but if we're talking about things that aren't in the internal emotional realm, both of us can be very Robin Williams in the quick variety of discussion. I'd imagine that would be when his Se is in gear and my Ne is going about perceptions of interest at the same time."
3375,isfp,"We do tend to love NFPs! I've only ever wanted to date them (my boyfriend is an ENFP too!) and I have a lot of good friends who are I/ENFP. It's really a learning experience because, being an S, I'm terrible at seeing the big picture and finding meaning in things that are supposed to have meaning. It's a struggle. 
But us ISFPs definitely get into these death spirals that we need help getting out of. Kudos to you for recognizing it and knowing how to fix it! "
3376,isfp,"We are two seniors. He's 50/50 ISFP/INFP. Been best friends since just before high-school. He started dating a mutual friend of mine and I almost dated that girl's best friend. We both enjoy the same types of music (EDM and some Alt. Rock). We both love Scandinavia/Europe. I'm going to Amsterdam in a month. He nearly got to come with me, but his parents wouldn't pay and he doesn't have the money. He's like a brother to me in the fact that I can tell him anything and he gets it. We've never come to a disagreement or argument on anything. We will likely both be going to Ohio State U and plan on being roommates.
More similarities than I was comfortable not commenting on.
Care to share a bit more? What are you two's interests aside from personality? What do you like to do together/talk about? "
3377,isfp,"Dude, that's insane; especially about you almost dating your friends girlfriends best friend, the same thing happened to me. I met this girl along with my friends girlfriend (now ex) waaaay back in seventh grade. She was the first girl I was ever infatuated in, and she was my first kiss in eighth grade. We met when I moved to an apartment complex in seventh grade and we were neighbors. She was so amazingly beautiful; everything about her was so captivating. Anyway, long story short, we almost dated in eleventh grade when I finally grew the balls and told her I liked her, and she liked me too! It was amazing for two months, then she told me she was still in love with her ex, so that ended.. It's kind of sad talking about it, because I haven't talked about this in sooo long. She was the only girl I was ever actually in love with.
And our interests are extremely similar. We met because he started dating my really good friend and he found out from my myspace page (ages ago) that I liked radiohead, deftones, broken social scene, etc.. I was blown away that someone else besides me liked radiohead! So we started chilling in tenth grade a lot.. Tenth grade was kind of a blur, then half way through eleventh grade we were talking about stuff at the park and he said he wanted to try 'mary jane' and so did I. We started smoking bud every Wednesday night, his girlfriend found out that we were smoking, she freaked out.. then literally a week later, to get back at us, his girlfriend and her friends smoked spice. Anyway, I'm getting into way too many details hahaha. Basically, we both love winter, same music, same political beliefs, religious beliefs, tv shows, etc. I can obviously go on and on, but I should probably end on this note haha. He's gotten me through some tough times man, and I honestly don't know what I'd do without him."
3378,isfp,"There's only going to be one or two people who are going to read this, and if no one reads it, well then it won't even be noticed, so I'll have no shame.
Point is, I really wanted to connect with other artists. But we only have 27 followers. Not to mention this sub has been inactive for months. But nevertheless, I'm subscribed. I hope this sub will somehow undergo a gigantic population growth. But not too big. Just a few thousand."
3379,isfp,"When I took over INFJ as well, it only had 5 subscribers and pretty much sat there untouched for 2 years. It's now over 400 and moderately active. So there is hope for ISFP yet! I wish there was at least news articles or something once in a while to post and garner attention."
3380,isfp,"INTP who originally thought he was an ISFP; welcome to the ranks. You may be better suited to lurking in /r/introvert; but I'm one of the few that does indeed read and answer you poor, lonely, misunderstood artists.
 So no worries about getting away with tonight's post."
3381,isfp,"I'll assume you didn't take the satire to your heart, I'm simply a lonely male waiting out the nightly hours; end of the year tests approach, and with it the memory of my advanced placement within my grade dances with possibility.
I'll look for you in the subreddit, perhaps we will converse again. I am always looking to help or speak with others."

Til again, touchy, feely, drawing person who is simultaneously irritatingly cheerful and serious."
3383,isfp,"I've just about wrapped up breaking bad and love it, history channels Vikings too.
My favorite live action is Always Sunny in Philadelphia and I like a few 90's sitcoms.
My favorite stuff to watch is cartoons though from My Little Pony, South Park, The Simpsons, Futurama and a few others"
3384,isfp,"right now im on Suits and Shameless
edit: to add some detail to this. my ESFJ recommended I watch Suits because Harvey is an ENTJ and she thought I'd hate/love him. I don't hate him, I admire is qualities but would probably feel infuriated around him. 
As for Shameless, I gave it a try on a whim and got addicted! my favourite character is Lip, who is IDed as an ENTP. Probably because I have never met a self-identified ENTP.
I also lazily watch Game of thrones."
3385,isfp,"I'm watching Firefly rn!
As far as TV shows go, I loved Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Night Of, Westworld, and American Horror Story. TV shows are kind of a time commitment for me so movies win them over.
I watch a ton of movies. I love love love all the Miyazaki movies, cheaply made Netflix horror, all of the Alien films, any Pok√©mon movie, Moonrise Kingdom, Interstellar and The Grand Budapest Hotel.
Whimsical but also horrifying is the key word here."
3386,isfp,"TV Shows:
I used to watch OUAT for Rumbelle, until it went to shit, and I finally quit after S5 ended because I couldn't stand the writing anymore. I recommend not watching any of the episodes of that show after 3x11 because everything after that is bullshit. 
I used to watch TWD until they killed off my favorite character in the S7 premiere.
I'm currently watching HBO's Game of Thrones, though the writing on that show often pisses me off too. 
I binge watched the first five seasons of AHS on Netflix, but I can't find S6 and S7 online, and honestly, I'm too lazy to search.
I also love to watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Family Guy sometimes when I have nothing else to do.
I tried Scream Queens, but got bored watching by S2.

3388,isfp,"So just to anonymize this a bit, let's say I belong to an artist's union, and me (INTJ) and ISFP friend joined up about the same time. We hang out and talk about art supplies a lot, and really enjoy it.
Well, it turns out that this friend has an extra set of homemade brushes and some equipment and wants to bring it over for me to try out. 
Lately he's kind of taking me under his wing, talking like, ""I'll help you out, show you how this stuff works, etc. Let's get you all set up!""
Normally this is kind of the INTJ approach, to be the didactic half of the relationship :D, so I'm kind of wondering if I should just play ISFP and let him teach me and be really sweet. I feel like it would be pretty easy to do that BUT I worry that the truth will come out!
And that hard truth is that I have done a metric ton of this shit in a previous career. lol. Like I've done for huge paychecks what he has done as a hobby, and I'm SO AFRAID he's going to find out and feel bad about that, and feel like he's embarrassed and then not want to hang out.
I worry because every time I admit something little that I know, that he doesn't know how to do, he's like :O and then tells his friends, ""guys, this dude knows how to X"". I'm like, ""anyway I'm not a big deal, I have a lot to learn"" because I really like this guy and I don't want to come off like a douche and I think it's so cool that he wants to share what he's good at.
Thoughts? Advice? He's coming over and I'm even cleaning my house and shit. I need all the friends I can get! Hook me up thanks! ;D"
3389,isfp,"Don't hide anything. We don't give gifts lightly. Yes it will hurt him to know he can't ""help"" you in this way but we get over stuff quickly.  He will probably learn to admire you for being so much better than him. Finding out later that he has been living a lie for weeks, months, etc will hurt SO MUCH more. Let him find another way to contribute to the relationship üòâ"
3390,isfp,"be honest with him, but be open to his advice and taking a different perspective on things if you want to let him teach you something. I think most people can usually learn something from others, we don't all think or do things in the exact same way
honesty is one of the most important things in my opinion"
3391,isfp,"Thanks, I was straight up with him and he kind of freaked out in a good way, but I emphasized that I don't have experience in other related areas, and it turned out that he did have experience there, so that was really productive. It went really well overall!"
3392,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and I really really like other people (mainly celebrities) that seem to have ISFP qualities.  For example, musicians:  I have seen Lana Del Rey, Marina Diamandis, and Lorde all typed as ISFPs before.  To me, they also seem like ISFPs.  
My favorite band is Coldplay.  They make me feel a certain way idk.. but I don't know if they could be considered all that ISFP or not.  I also like listening to Lana, Marina, and Lorde; and although they aren't necessarily my favorite musicians, I do like them a lot and I feel almost ""connected"" to them. 
They seem very similar to me and I relate to their music.. It's almost like their music is the type of music I would make if I wanted to be/was a musician.  
Maybe I'm just really sensitive to when they use any Fi/Se/Ni/Te at all, and less sensitive to when they use other functions, so that they therefore seem more ISFP to me than they seem any other type??  I don't know.  Thoughts?
(forgive me if I should be posting this on, like, PersonalityCafe instead of reddit..)
I'm not the best at describing functions on paper, so some of these are NOT MY WORDS, but all 3 (Lana, Marina, Lorde) all seem to:
-""SeNi: explore the emerging experience, internalize the   meanings//SeNi: the substance of experience is observed as it emerges from the environment, so the ideas of things are taken from an individual arsenal of subconscious impressions (http://www.erictb.info/temperament2.html)
-Have dominant Fi.. very tuned in to their own feelings.  Most of their songs focus on this, even if it's subtly.
-Lana Del Rey has also kind of created an image.  Not all her songs may come across as being sung by an ISFP (although many do) but to ""orchestrate"" and create a whole 'aesthetic' like that is very ISFP, or at least very like me.  The sensory aspects of her songs really evoke a particular feeling.
-Marina often mentions her selfishness.  She has said her songs are often about an exaggerated version of herself.  The way she sings about her selfishness is very much like exaggerated introverted feeling (Fi) turned a little negative.
-All demonstrate an ""individualized approach to people and a more objective/collective approach to things"" (http://personalityjunkie.com/04/ti-fe-fi-te-function-pairs-type-biases/) 
-Their music is personal, filled with objective observations, evokes certain feelings, sounds pleasing to the ear, and is filled with subtle insight.
-Their music is still different from each other, though.  Lana creates beautiful music that makes you feel something.  She paints pictures with her songs.  Marina sings about her take on her own experiences.  How she feels about herself and situations she has been in.  Lorde's music is slightly cynical.  It's about her internal view of the world.  Her feelings and how they compare to the world around her.
I'm terrible at explaining all this, ha.. sorry.
((This was supposed to be a post about whether any of you other ISFPs really like other ISFPs, like I do.. but it sorta turned into more of a post about whether you can agree with why I think 3 particular people are ISFPs........This is so scattered I seriously apologize))
~Also, I don't only like ISFPs, haha.  I like feeling connected to people, though.  Other music I like are: Coldplay, the XX, Beatles, Nirvana, The Killers,  The Lumineers, and Taylor Swift (ha).  [I also like Kanye West? I haven't listened to all of his music but he seems like a super confident version of an ISFP.. sorta? I don't know.] I don't know what they would be typed as though."
3393,isfp,"Don't apologise, the rambling is cute. You've obviously had a thought in your head but found it pretty hard to explain, we gotta appreciate you even willing to share all this. 
Anyway, By the looks of it there's a lot of big ISFP musicians. I've heard Rihanna is also ISFP. She doesn't really create her music though so it may be hard to tell by her songs. Michael Jackson is an obvious ISFP. People also consider Lady Gaga as ISFP.
Sucks there aren't many ISTP musicians that I know of, but I find myself thinking the same towards ISTP TV/movie characters instead. "
3394,isfp,"Lol, not an ISFP but I've noticed that you guys tend to pine over celebrities that are your type or are SPs in general, which is usually the case since music/art/fashion are areas they usually thrive in. My cousin is an ISFP and her love for Taylor Swift is next level.
Here are just a few artists of recent note that I've seen ISFPs stan for:
Lana Del Rey
Halsey
Charlie XCX
Taylor Swift
Jessie J
Madonna
Lady Gaga
Lorde
Marina Diamandis/and the Diamonds
Melanie Martinez
Beyonce
Rihanna
Nicki Minaj
Rita Ora
Fifth Harmony
Ellie Goulding
Adele
SiA
Florence Welch/and the Machine
Ariana Grande
Pink
Katy Perry
Christina Aguilera
Mariah Carey
Demi Lovato
Selena Gomez
Britney Spears
Gwen Stefani
Kesha
Carly Rae Jepson
Miley Cyrus
There are probably more but...they share similar sounds/feel/lyrical styles. They either have a ""diva"" or ""quirky"" aesthetic or a mixture of both."
3395,isfp,"I really listen to a lot of ska/punk and rock and electronic and whatever.  Not sure If I know what their MBTI types are lol.  But I do really like stuff that has some sort of meaning or passion put into it and absolutely can't stand most pop music that can be summed up with the word ""Party"".  Bleh, shoot me.  I'm actually usually pretty against most pop music in general.  I feel like a lot of people just like it cause it's ""cool"" to like it and it's generally vague enough that anyone can come up with some sort of connection to it.  But to each his own, I guess."
3396,isfp,"Hahaha thanks.  Yeah, I've heard that they are too, but, like you said, it is harder to see the ISFP in her (and some other supposedly ISFP musicians') songs.  I think the only ISTP musicians I've seen are Keith Richards and Miles Davis, according to Celebrity Types, but I don't know how accurate that is.  "
3397,isfp,"Hahaha don't worry, it reads like my brain functions. I used to be really self conscious in the past whenever in posted online but most of my online friends assured me they enjoyed reading my long rants.
I wish I had more to add to the actual discussion but I honestly don't know what to say about it. I don't really know any other ISFPs IRL that I'm aware of...and I don't often pay much attention to the types of celebrities. However, I do agree with your analysis even if I'm not super familiar with those artists (so I'm not sure how much my agreement really counts for)."
3398,isfp,"I used to be super allergic to cats when I was in elementary school, found out when I went to my teacher's house where she had 3 cats and my eyes were red and had snot everywhere. 
During college tho a girl I rent apartments with adopted a stray cat and It turns out I suddenly wasnt as allergic anymore. Now I have two cats and I feel they are more smart and cute than any dogs I've had in the past. "
3399,isfp,For me it is not being able to stop my feelings from coming out of my mouth as soon as I feel them (it drives my INTP partner mad) and always worrying about deadlines but still leaving them until the very last minute.
3400,isfp,"Same, and on top of it:


changing jobs more and more often because I get bored woth them (used to be after 3 years now around 1.5!),


not planning anything because as soon as I do it starts to feel like a commitment - a big no for me,


don't know if it's and ISFP thing, but as soon as someone classifies me as a specific type of person e.g. cheerful or serious or ANY type really, I want to be exactly the opposite and not commit to that type of personality

"
3401,isfp,"i‚Äôm about to sound real pretentious, ya‚Äôll:
Being averse to tour groups and attractions. it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm being pandered to. start feeling controlled, and i hate that. end up usually wandering off on my own, trying to sneak into places. tourist traps and photo ops disgust me. especially badly painted wings on a wall. why people line up for something like that.. just yuck. like a venus fly trap for basic people."
3402,isfp,"I don‚Äôt really have a main trait but a combination. 
I really hold back my thoughts/emotions unless someone I trust prompts me to open up, then I can‚Äôt hold back but usually struggle to explain feelings. 
I get along with most people but have a select few I am really close with. 
Very unorganised and spontaneous. I do what I want when I want to. I recently decided to go on a holiday while I was eating lunch. Once I finished eating I packed a few essentials and went on a 3 day holiday to the beach which is 6 hours drive away.  All went fine and had a great time. 
Wouldn‚Äôt call myself an artistic type but. 
Really enjoy exploring nature. I love just climbing random hills to get a view of the plains. My friends think I‚Äôm weird af for this haha. I would rather check out things I like rather than the typical touristy things. 
Don‚Äôt mind being alone, especially when exploring. 
Try lots of different hobbies. From music to hiking to cooking to dirt bikes to sports. 
My biggest hate is people who are fake or talk themselves up so much, especially if they are putting others down doing it. I strongly believe in actions speak louder than words and will merit people on their actions rather than what they say. 
I need reassurance often from friends and loved ones. Doesn‚Äôt have to be verbal or anything really, just as long as I know they accept me etc.
I tend to keep the peace with people. If someone is wrong about something I usually don‚Äôt tell them unless it‚Äôs about something I‚Äôm really passionate about. Normally I will try to try and prompt people into thinking more about it. A bit hard to explain but basically try to push them to realise that they are wrong and figure out the answer without them realise I‚Äôm doing it so they think they came up with the idea and I just helped them. I think anyone can do this but I didn‚Äôt even realise that I did it. 
I think that‚Äôs it? Feel free to ask any questions. I love hearing other peoples experiences too"
3403,isfp,"My ISFP...
I don't communicate well, I hold stuff back to keep the peace.  I love to help people, especially on big projects that can cost a lot of money.  I like to do those projects for free for all my friends and family.  I can come off as a control freak when I believe in something I hold my ground.  Even if what I believe in might not really be correct, it's correct if I think it's correct.  And I will admit that, because I'm so freaking honest when I do open up.  
I like being told by my wife she loves me, I need to hear that, although I don't ever ask for it.  But, I will get down and out if I don't hear it and I'll start thinking up bad reasons why she didn't say it when there may be no reason at all.
I don't like criticism or being told to do something especially if I already know it needs to be done.  For that same reason, I have no desire to be a manager or lead.  If I don't like to be told what to do, I feel neither does anyone else so I don't want to be that person. However I do like to inspire or place thoughts out there for people to grab on to and do great things with. That's the helper in me.
I like being good at something, and because I can get bored quickly with things I'm not good at I often move on to something new in search of being the best at it.  I am competitive, even though I might say I don't care who wins.  People that are good at what they do and brag about it, annoy me.  What's worse to me is someone that does brag and they truly are as good as they say,  no can beat them...I hate that.  When I was a kid I could not wait to see ""Ali"" lose a fight just for that reason.  And cheered the day Spinks beat him.  Although today, I admire Ali, he was truly ""The Greatest.""
I absolutely can't stand the wait time at restaurants.  It better be a very short wait or I'll walk out, I don't care how great the food is.  I'll probably go back for the food but I would do it at 3pm instead of 5pm just to avoid the wait.  It took many years to be able to tolerate Disneyland, but knowing how much my kids loved it I had to learn to like it.  I mean it's nice and all but the crowds and the lines just make my skin crawl."
3404,isfp,"My isfp partner is the opposite. He holds all of his opinions and emotions back for the most part.
He doesn‚Äôt plan as far as a day ahead, typically.
He is very, very kind, gracious, patient. 
He does have his breaking points, however that I get to see because I am close to him."
3405,isfp,"Not being able to make life decisions, 
Not being organised,
being spontaneous.  
Oh but wait.... in true ISFP fashion I can also make life decisions, I can be very tidy and I can be very organised.... but it all just depends on my mood, and the bursts of energy that get me there. Basically I'm just all over the shop."
3406,isfp,"
enjoying being 'weird', like, 'weird'/'unique' as a personality trait
being really emotional (but not as weepy as an INFP ;) )
spontaneous and flitting from interest to interest
my focus on sensations and experiences vs thoughts and musings
strong personal beliefs that clash with others (i.e. if I know you believe or support x or y thing I find abhorrent we won't be friends and I won't like you), even when it's 'irrelevant'
"
3407,isfp,i identify as an INFP but lately ive been rethinking my results and I relate to that state of mind so much. anything 'basic' is disgusting to me and i have to force myself to like them to feel like i fit in.
3408,isfp,"Even with me he tries to stay extremely passive and patient. It is also his public persona for the most part. He doesn‚Äôt break at me or because of me, even though I know he is trying to hold back things as his own attempt to make everything smooth. He only says things that he essentially needs to in regards to ‚Äúcomplains & grievances‚Äù 
I have to kind of prod him to get an answer out of him for pretty much anything, or to get feed back on what I might have done to disgruntle him/ ruffle his feathers. Otherwise, he tries to hold a lot back. Seriously like all the time lol He does this for conflict reduction, the famous ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù (he has many interests on many topics and this is his ultimate conclusion currently because it is better to have an open mind for him) and for logical/emotional empathic reasons.  
His emotions are not completely walled up, he just always is trying to have control over it. However he is very, very hard on himself and is how he keeps control.. double edged sword. 
He is amazing lol"
3409,isfp,"I‚Äôm adding this here because I realised this kinda turned into a rant about my ex lmao. Promise I‚Äôm alright, I just kinda rambled on a bit :) feel free to ignore and write your answers below!
I ask the second question specifically because I‚Äôm pretty sure my most recent ex was an ExTP. More likely ENTP. I‚Äôm not entirely sure, but I‚Äôm pretty sure. I‚Äôm trying to type off of my vague memory since the last time we spoke over half a year ago haha. 
Reasons I think she is - she had a very unique, slightly dark sense of humour. I weirdly liked that about her. I would even class her as ‚Äúquirky‚Äù - but the hot kind. You know what I mean.. it‚Äôs like she had this unique personality no one else really did. I‚Äôve still never found anyone similar to her. She was very bubbly and loud; which did slightly annoy me. She also didn‚Äôt seem that open with her feelings. I (kind of..) felt loved for the most part, but she didn‚Äôt really show that. She was affectionate, but mainly physically. Infact the way she showed love was usually playfully. Teasing jokes perhaps. I found it enjoyable. She was also generally super attractive. We never really shared any feelings. Our conversations didn‚Äôt particularly have that tone.
She talked a lottt, particularly about herself. I was fairly happy to listen though. But it did get on my nerves when she went on. Especially if she was super loud and obnoxious in public. I‚Äôd silently cringe as I knew everyone around us was probably annoyed. She is also an aspiring lawyer; which I think is a fitting career. 
Anyway, we spent a year and a half together. To this day my best relationship and I‚Äôm extremely grateful for the time I spent with her. It ended fairly smoothly; however she didn‚Äôt really seem bothered when I ended it. Infact; it was me who was doing all the missing and wanting her back even tho I ended it lmao. But I just didn‚Äôt feel as loved, and I didn‚Äôt feel as much meaning. 
I still don‚Äôt quite know why I ended it. It‚Äôs like - the relationship was conventionally great. Never argued. But I just wasn‚Äôt happy enough. I wasn‚Äôt unhappy, it just didn‚Äôt feel, right. The only reason I could give for ending it was a gut feeling I had. Turns out right after breaking up she moved onto someone else pretty quickly so hey, perhaps I was right!
Anyway, that‚Äôs my take on what I‚Äôm sure is an ISFP-ExTP relationship. Interested to hear yours, or any other experiences you have!"
3410,isfp,"my two best romantic relationships were both with ENFPs. there was also a really short and intense one with a ENTP and a terrible one with a ENFJ. oh, and i used to hang out with a INFP and it was pretty good but she lived in another city :(
i usually get along well with xNFPs. i'm mostly intimidated by ExTPs in general tbh"
3411,isfp,"That‚Äôs really interesting; since usually everyone says ‚Äúoh sensors and intuitives don‚Äôt work‚Äù But I‚Äôve never really believed it. Sounds like you don‚Äôt either. I personally love INFPs but I‚Äôm not sure how that would work romantically. 
I can‚Äôt say I really know any ENFPs but I used to be close to one.. yup.. She was fascinating! And yeah, ENTPs are intimidating but I guess this one was different? Who knows. I still question whether she is cause it would mean she‚Äôs nothing like any other ENTP I know - but it just makes sense. Thanks for the reply though!"
3412,isfp,"No no, you‚Äôve actually explained it perfectly. I think Fi also makes people wildly different. Some of the differences between individuals who use Fi are huge when it comes to what an they personally are like. There‚Äôs huge potential for success, as well as conflict. 
I also wondered whether it would work because the two types are so similar. But I don‚Äôt judge people based off type, so apologies for making such a general statement!"
3413,isfp,"Oh hey don't apologize, I do generalize too, dw!
What I think FOR SURE it clashes, it's Ti and Fi. That just doesn't make either party happy. It can be challenging, a learning experience, but not a lasting, happily ever after one. So I'd say that XTXPs are not a good match for us."
3414,isfp,"Damn, you actually explained everything perfectly. It was good, but not right/lasting. Just as it was challenging, but a fantastic learning experience. As I said, I‚Äôm still very grateful for the relationship. It‚Äôs also great to understand why it didn‚Äôt work; so thanks a lot!"
3415,isfp,"When I get comfortable with people things tend to slip out of my mouth. This has happened with ""lovers"" lol, and it always tends to happen when we're talking. 
Does this happen to anyone else? I'm usually pretty cautious when speaking to people until I let my guard down, and then realize what I have done a bit late sometimes."
3416,isfp,"Haha I feel you. I'm starting Administration this september because it's a safe job, and introvert friendly lol.
It can get repetitive, but that's what holidays are for, right?
Some ISFP in this sub enjoyed dish washing too. 
Maybe construction, office jobs, manufacturing... idk. Something that keeps your wallet safe while you don't think or talk much."
3417,isfp,"+1 with admin, I think organising stuff for other people is a good way to practise your own organisation skills without it having a personal stake. We're easygoing enough that we get on in a chill office environment, and it's a regular paycheck. "
3418,isfp,"Maybe cook, landscaping, painter (painting houses, which is always in demand), retail (clothing), teacher, counselor, graphic designer, web designer, videographer, lighting specialist (lighting video shoots or even working in a lighting store), event planner, baker, wedding planner... anything sound interesting? "
3419,isfp,"I have a few friends who are graphic designers, seems like it works well for them but I'm not sure on the specifics of everything. definitely is something I'd like to do though. really any type of design would be cool, I'd love to do apparel/fashion design or automotive design, but I  hate school and it's also really expensive, so I don't care to spend that much time and money learning how
I see police officer as something recommended for ISFPs a lot, but personally I think I'd hate doing that. firefighter interests me though and it's something I'm gonna try to do"
3420,isfp,"It‚Äôs a really good question, I too have taken the safe path but feeling like something is missing. 
I‚Äôm an isfp technical consultant. It‚Äôs good cause I have developed relationships with my handful of clients and get to problem solve with them however I struggle being organised and being assertive. 
I don‚Äôt get why people suggest retail. You get pressured to sell people stuff when they might not really need it. I hate that. 
I‚Äôm now trying a research job. I‚Äôm not sure how this will go. 
I think Paramedic or ambulance person (I think paramedic means different things overseas) or maybe nurse or counseler or phycologist etc might be good for isfp too. Social worker."
3421,isfp,"I've found that I really enjoy more manual labor jobs, like landscaping, building, and even stuff like housekeeping. I grew up in a business-oriented household, so it was implied that manual jobs weren't good jobs. However, now that I've worked a couple, I love them. Maybe it's the secondary Se function, but I love being able to see the work I've done, and know that I've done it with my own hands. I also like those types of jobs because you have to deal with people much less, haha. If you wanna make big bucks with that sort of thing, you can do things like flip houses or start a landscaping business."
3422,isfp,I go from being very clingy and needy to being completely reclusive and even hostile to the people I was just latched on to. I think it has more to do with my upbringing than just being an ISFP though.
3423,isfp,"I find I can be very clingy, especially in unfamiliar situations. I think for me personally it comes from being very shy and having anxiety. I do know that I have been clingy for as long as I can remember. "
3424,isfp,I can also sometimes be clingy to my close friends in unfamiliar social situations. I've also been slightly clingy to my S.O. at certain points in our relationship (I feel that sadness too when we have to part ways). But generally I like being left alone so I'm not the clingiest person (I hope lol).
3425,isfp,"My close friend is an ISFP, as an outside perspective, yes he can be very clingy.
1) When he lived long distance he developed feelings for me and when I described his behavior to another guy pal he said I was being treated like a girlfriend before we'd met. He was constantly calling or texting and if I didn't reply quickly he would keep blowing up my phone.
2) As friends he did this to me last year. If I didn't reply within 1 day or a few hours I'd get either a ""are you mad at me?"" or a sort of ""hope you're well"" ping.
Also every time he has a girlfriend he vanishes completely and I'm fairly sure he's just smothering her.
He does not see himself as clingy though because this is his normal. Weirdly I'm an ENFP and I'm supposed to be clingy-smothery. (I'm not at all)"
3426,isfp,"Used to be clingy when i were younger, but the older i get the more afraid of commitment i get, i suppose thats the closest thing to the opposite i can come up with. I let my gf sex anyone she wants, i can go weeks without calling or texting friends unless they aproach me first."
3427,isfp,"I don't find ENFPs to be particularly clingy.  They do tend to want to talk a lot when they first get to know you and are trying to figure you out though.  This is something ENTPs seem to share.  ""YOU'RE NEAT HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN BRAIN??""  "
3428,isfp,"Imo ExTJs are in a way some of the weirdest types to me, in terms of my relation to them. Very much a love/hate thing. 
To start off, I generally get along very well with IxTJs. However, ExTJs generally have a completely different vibe to them, and in many cases they come across as pretty intimidating (however in a different way than ExTPs). When they're healthy people I generally find them pretty cool, but when they're not they usually (ENTJs in particular) seem to subscribe to a rather narcissistic and elitist way of thinking, like ""man the world would be better off without dumb feelers and sensors, thinkers and intuitives, I salute you"", and they can be pretty crass.
The inferior Fi is also a bit of a bait and switch, initially I'm like ""oh neat, Fi users"", but irl it's kinda absent in them. From what I've read it's very similar to Fi in ExTPs, although still seems different from outside. The healthy ones are more skilled at it, though.
I've also seen quite a few ExTJs irl, and they've always been extremes. One (ESTJ) was a bit of a smooth, narcissistic, manipulating jerk, another (ESTJ teacher) was a total psychopath who imposed almost rules in an almost fascist way, and I know I've seen other ExTJs who were really cool and nice, basically behaved more like socially confident IxTJs."
3429,isfp,"I don‚Äôt usually care for ESTJ men but I like ESTJ women, for the most part. The ESTJ men I dated were bossy, arrogant, persnickety about shit that didn‚Äôt matter, and didn‚Äôt seem loyal.
I identify with ENTJs a lot, probably because I‚Äôm a bit maladjusted for an ISFP and therefore closer on the spectrum to a weak ENTJ‚Äôs personality since we share the same functions, just in reverse.
I am always great friends with ENTJ women irl and the men can be hit or miss. Good for friendships, not for dating. Most of them have a man whore personality going on and seem like they‚Äôre always looking out for the next best thing.
I have met some who aren‚Äôt like that though."
3430,isfp,"I‚Äôm married to a ENTJ male. I‚Äôm pretty ok with all ExTJs, I totally understand the ‚Äúangry dictator‚Äù stereotype but I find that you just have to do your work properly and they‚Äôre fine. They can be very friendly and  fun loving outside of work."
3431,isfp,"I'm 22 and have never had a relationship. I'm a guy and I've asked a few girls out but always get a no. I like a girl a work but have no idea what to do but I seem happier when I'm around her which is something since I'm normally quite depressed. So I'll smile and talk to her and try to joke around but I'm worried because it's work so a number of things could go wrong. I don't really know what I'm doing or how to flirt or tell if she likes me back or not. 
I do seem to favor my sense of touch so I would imagine if I ever get to have a relationship I would be into physical contact and communication. I can talk but it's usually when I'm interested in something or have something to say so so I'm not very good at small talk but I'm working on it and trying to put effort into that. I'm pretty guarded with my feelings since they are so strong and sad and painful for me so if I was willing to show that part of myself I would really have to trust someone and even then it would be terrifying to be that vulnerable. I also had an emotionally abusive and neglectful childhood though so that could be because I'm so damaged and broken. I'm starting to think it would be better for me to not be in a relationship because I'm so fucked up and don't understand relationships and don't think that anyone would or could ever want me. Maybe it would just be better for everyone to just accept that I'll be alone and try to move on. I've never gotten to experience any of it (even being kissed or just holding hands) and don't really know what it would be like to be liked or be loved. I think it could be nice though, I just don't know who would want a 6'3"" 266 pound 22 year old virgin with depression anxiety and ADD who lives at home while in college with no confidence or self esteem and damaged and has issues. I'm working on stuff( I lost 88 pounds) but don't think I could ever fix myself enough to be desirable. "
3432,isfp,"You shouldn't think that you are not worthy of love and understanding-- because everyone is worthy of it. The truth is that most people judge and pick partners based on looks, so your efforts to look better are not wasted. I think self-improvement is a good place to start so you are not doing anything wrong, but self-improvement also includes improving your values and standards for other people. You should probably try to get to know more people and see how well you click with them, and have standards for how they treat you so they don't step all over you. I know how hard it is because I'm introverted too, but if you really need help, reddit is here :)"
3433,isfp,"The good news is that ISFPs like us are charming and mysterious and gentle and kind. And ADD can come across as spontaneous, cute and entertaining. The bad news is that depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem make it more challenging for you to reach your full potential. Challenging is much different from impossible. 


It sounds like you've made amazing progress towards getting in shape. Losing 88 pounds is no easy task.  Take time to appreciate yourself and your progress, and keep working towards your fitness goals. Make sure you're eating healthy food, and enough of it, and not just cutting back. It's not just about losing weight, it's about being healthy, because a healthy body contributes to a healthy mind. Plus, there's a huge confidence boost that comes from seeing progress you've made. And being 6'3"" is awesome, a tall man with confidence has a natural advantage! 


Read the Feeling Good Handbook. Sounds lame, but I reeeally recommend it.  It helps you learn to be aware of your thought processes, and redirect your mind when it starts sabotaging itself. It's not about blind optimism, it's about being fair towards yourself. This book has given me so much insight into the lies that my anxiety has told me, and it has empowered me to take a step back from anxious thoughts and see them for what they are.


Realistically, chronic mental illness can't simply be ""cured"" in a few simple steps... I do take antidepressants, but they would be much less effective if I didn't put in the effort to take care of my body and mind. I get depressed still, but the key is learning that the negative anxious thoughts are part of the illness and that you can't take them as fact. 
Do you take antidepressants, anxiety meds or ADD meds? 
I take wellbutrin, and it turns me from a sad sluggish puddle into an energetic and awake human being. It pulls me out of the fog. I don't know what your depression/anxiety is like, and different people benefit from different antidepressents, but let me know if you have questions. Also, seeing a therapist is important too, at least to try it! "
3434,isfp,"You've probably heard of: You must be able to love yourself, before you are ready for a relationship. And this is so true. From what you said I get the idea that you don't love yourself. You can have relationships if you don't, but all your problems will be catalysed and your problems will become the other persons problems, and you will actually reinforce any negative feelings you have towards yourself because you'll be angry that your problems are causing more problems. People who don't love themselves run the danger of subconciously using a relationship to feel better, and it will make you feel better for a while (for all the wrong reasons), but your problems will come back to bite you full force. And you'll risk destroying something good. Or, you'll portray yourself as different from what you are because you are ashamed of who you really are, the other person will fall in love with that persona, and when you break your performance (you will, because you cannot be someone you are not) the romance will collapse.
Take the time to become and learn to be the person that you want to be, a person that you can love; and romantic love will follow out of that.
I speak from experience with my boyfriend: He was 27 when we met, never even kissed someone else before, bad childhood, depression, his mom died a month before we met, deeply rooted insecurities. I think we worked out because we were lucky and are absolutely made for each other, but I'm afraid it's more likely for a budding relationship to crash under those circumstances. I definitely wasn't easy at times for us.
Plus, I've seen the opposite over and over again: a person focusses on cultivating a good mindset (actually believing that they are worthy and lovable just the way they are), other people pick up on the good vibes, the right person will be attracted, and you'll be ready for loving someone else because you're not haunted by all your issues.
Don't despair, your chances may seem bleak, but they aren't. You're young, and with 7 billion people on the world there is definitely someone out there for you. Just remember that you greatly increase your chances of finding and keeping the right person if you love yourself."
3435,isfp,"I am seeing a therapist and think it and medications has helped to save my life, I don't think I'd be here right now without it and would probably have had more than just the one suicide attempt by now. 
I wish I felt good about the weight loss but I don't really see a change and still hate how I look, even my face. I'm trying to be healthier and do more than just not eat much but I've been slipping lately. I feel like I've made no progress so I don't have a lot of incentive to keep going. I take Effexor, ability, and trazodone for the depression and adderal for the ADHD."
3436,isfp,I really don't love myself I'm working on my self hate and loathing but the progress is so slow and hard to get. It's affecting every part of my life and I wish I could be kind to myself or like myself or anything I do but I don't I hate myself and who I am even though I don't think I've done anything really wrong but it's so deeply engrained in me I can't stop it and it makes me want to die sometimes
3437,isfp,"Maybe your family is just... messed up. That's not your fault. In fact, you should be proud that you survived a messed up childhood AND became a pretty decent person with good values. Don't hate yourself-there's no logical reason for that, although I understand that illogical feelings factor into self-hate sometimes. You sound like a decent dude who would treat their partner or friends well, so, you deserve love and understanding. Just make sure they treat you well too.  "
3438,isfp,"That is good that you're taking steps to manage your depression! I'm glad therapy and medications are helping. 
Also, if you are trying to be healthier and feel better, it is very important to exercise! It's one of nature's best antidepressants. You'll get more energy, more pep in your step, and an improved mood afterwards. At first it's hard and it's easy to give up, but the longer you keep at it the more you'll feel the benefits. 
It is also important to keep training yourself to recognize the difference between anxious thinking and objective, fair thinking. Example:
Anxious thought you mentioned: ""I don't see a change in my appearance after all my efforts, I feel like I've made no progress and don't have incentive to keep going""
Mental redirection: ""I've lost 88 pounds, which is more than most people could lift. It's about the size of a fifth grader or a Great Dane. That is, objectively, a lot for one person to lose, and it makes a big difference! I'm fitting into smaller clothes and wearing my belt at a tighter notch, so I've definitely slimmed down.""
Treat yourself with compassion and fairness, and challenge the negative thoughts as they come. "
3439,isfp,"I suggest you seek counseling, and if that is not available to you I suggest you turn to online fora or self-help books for insight into how you could use certain psychological tricks to recondition yourself. Reconditioning might sound kind of analytical, but that is essentially what has to be done to revert the years of conditioning you have endured which taught you your negative self image. Mind that depending on how deep the issue is rooted it could take several years before you've learned how to manage them. Note that I said 'manage them', because it is unlikely that the negativity toward yourself will ever completely go away considering the depth of the issue. 
But don't despair, truly, because with some time and patience things will get a lot better up to a point where your issues might still pop up here and there but they won't dictate you or your life; you will master them. And remember: every day, every moment, is an opportunity to start again, a new beginning. If you don't seek help now, you can tomorrow. If you made progress but 'relapse' because a certain event triggers the negativity again, no worries, the next moment is a fresh moment in which you can say to yourself ""Ok, I just hated myself there, but that was just now, and the negativity and the reason for that negativity do not define me, and now there is a new moment again and I can refocus on positivity"". It's ok to have negative feelings, everybody has them multiple times a day one way or another, but the trick is to let them be and and to let them pass. That is the first step to moving beyond them so they do not hold you in their grip.
I also suggest you read into mindfulness, it has helped my boyfriend tremendously with his depression and is issues."
3440,isfp,Thanks I'm trying to look at it as surviving is a strength thing. I'm also working on being treated well. I'm starting to recognize negative relationships but don't have good ones to replace them yet and don't want to be completely without friends.
3441,isfp,"I'm in therapy now and have been for about 4 years now, I think it helps but it's a really slow progress and it's very very hard for me to recognize and give myself credit for making improvement. I went from taking one college class at a time to 3 over the course of a few semesters and seem to only be able to focus on the fact that I'm not taking a full load like I'm supposed to instead of that I'm making progress. My heads just a mess. I try to meditate and do mindfulness and sometimes it helps"
3442,isfp,"Keep it up! Really, with every tiny step you take you're making progress. Those tiny steps are worth a tremendous amount, especially because you're coming from a bad place and are still in such a hard situation. It's not easy, it takes a lot of strength to take those steps, and even more strength to take the next one. I know this from first-hand experience with my boyfriend's issues and with my own.
My boyfriend is making progress every day concerning his self-confidence, the death of his mother, the bad relationship he has with his father, the fear of losing me and my family. It's a going back and forth of steps forward and steps backward. The same goes for me. I struggled with myself for years because of a vitamin B12 deficiency I didn't know about. Since two years I've been getting monthly injections, but healing takes time, and especially the psychological/cognitive symptoms aren't easy to shake off. I thought something was wrong with me, especially cognitively. Still I'm insecure about how much work/stress I can take, hence I underestimate my (intellectual) abilities and see an inability to handle something as a sign that I am indeed not competent. Staying up late or making long hours not only physically but also mentally exhausts me, so I still have to take it easy and sometimes that makes me feel really weak. I'm not 80 years old, damnit! That train phobia has gotten better (I don't need to travel by train any more) but it is still there, and it won't ever truly go away. I'm scared for the day I'll have to use the train again to get to work...
But we can do it! We already are, we're making progress every day. You, me, my boyfriend, and every body else in the world. Everybody has got issues, it's true. A dear colleague of mine won't say it, but I see that she's struggling with where she's going in life and she already in her thirties. She's not doing so well at work, and her ability to have any kind of future in our line of work (scientific research) heavily depends on how she performs now. She's scared, she won't say it, but I see it. My boss is really insecure about how to build a personal, but still maintain a professional, relationship with his employees. He notices that he is not connected with us, that he is in fact an outsider. He would like to connect with us but he doesn't know how. I see that he tries to make progress, to take steps in the right direction, but it's hard. 
But that doesn't matter, what counts is that we're working on ourselves to get better!"
3443,isfp,"Do you sometimes feel like that you can truly enjoy yourself only when you‚Äôre experiencing emotions? Is that why I feel like I‚Äôm not living most of the time?  This is why I use drugs, to let my emotions get out of the system and express them"
3444,isfp,I could live without my emotions. It actually feels like they get in the way of living. Enneagram can play a large part in that though. Don‚Äôt 9‚Äôs sometimes struggle with being numb and 4‚Äôs enjoying feeling emotions?
3445,isfp,"not sure what you mean, aren't you always experience emotions to some degree? if you mean heightened emotions like happiness then no, I don't need to feel a lot of happiness to enjoy myself. but even that doesn't make sense to me- obviously I'm feeling something when I'm enjoying myself, I'm not numb.  most of my emotions are sadness and anger and I could definitely go without those. I am used to blocking them out for the most part so they don't take over my life"
3446,isfp,"I think I get what you‚Äôre saying but I could be wrong. Anyway I find I get stuck in these sort of negative internal emotion phases, I don‚Äôt know how to explain it... anyway I now know that when I get this way, like feeling numb or down and just spending a lot of time in my head, I need to take a break from my inside world and get out and go for a walk, or a drive or something to just to experience the world. Sounds stupid but it works wonders for me!"
3447,isfp,"I pretty much always feel emotions and I‚Äôm very in tune with them. I try to hold back but I can‚Äôt help but feel a lot and express my emotions. I actually avoid drugs, especially alcohol, because my emotions can get so out of hand and I embarrass myself"
3448,isfp,"Yeah I find this too, I have to be careful with drinking because it just makes whatever I‚Äôm feeling go extreme, so I‚Äôm I‚Äôm feeling anxious or lonely it seems like the end of the world. Feeling happy and extraverted it‚Äôs great but."
3449,isfp,"Wow that‚Äôs a great way to put it. I feel like my words never EVER come out properly, they are never correct or close enough to how I feel when I try to explain, or it‚Äôs tiny bits of context that never get explored unless I choose to ponder things uninterrupted. I feel so distant with my physical self, because my reservation (in my mind) makes my actions and words seem even more disconnected from the real me. Ah, the spiral of existentialism. I really relate to how you worded that."
3450,isfp,I really relate to this. Sometimes when I talk I just give up and don‚Äôt say anything because I cannot word what I‚Äôm feeling/ don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm feeling (repressed emotions). Also pondering about stuff alone is great. If you want you can shoot me a message and we can talk about stuff like this.
3451,isfp,"Yes I give up too, like a voice in my head that says ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù because the context of things washes over my mind and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt even form a little bit of a response because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs too much to address, how do I address one thing without being misconstrued? Better I say nothing than be misunderstood and have it brought up later in whatever way.‚Äù 
If you‚Äôd like, feel free! I am a recluse and don‚Äôt reach out naturally, which sounds stupid. I get stress from one on one interaction, even though this is a public forum. Once it moves, my body decides it‚Äôs time to douse my entire system with too much cortisol and I get clammy, sweaty, and shake like a leaf. STUPID RIGHT? But I‚Äôm open to talk. I really relate to what you said."
3452,isfp,"Hey sisters and brothers,
One of my largest areas of suffering coming from and isfp background is huge feelings of inadequacy when it comes to creating/producing and a over reliance of feedback from others to make me aware that my work is valued and appreciated.
What methods do you apply to counteract these feelings? Can they be remedied by yourself? Or do you need to push yourself into circles where support is readily given?
Have a great day guys and girls."
3453,isfp,"I have similar problems. For the past four years, I essentially stopped creating and was paralysed by my own feelings of inadequacy. 
Only recently have I started to draw, paint and create again. I had to find my own reasons for doing so though, I found that an over reliance on other peoples' feedback stopped me creating. It's enough now that I am proud of what I am doing and I want to do it. I started attending a painting class and I found that the teacher's advice about my paintings was helpful. I've tried to move away from feedback from people who don't matter and tried get advice from people who actually want to help me. Sometimes, the people we ask have other motivations and their feedback is unhelpful. Maybe try and focus on constructive feedback and try and find your own reasons for creating things.
I apologise if this sounds a bit muddled, I'm a little bit muddled about this problem myself."
3454,isfp,"I'm struggling with these myself. I don't have all the answers, but I find that small acts of creativity can invite in larger inspirations and maybe even a feeling of self-confidence in your work. Something as simple as a journal entry or doodle can help 'prime' your brain to create more things.
The hardest hurdle for me is being able to like my own work. I think this video is super important to watch for anyone (of any creative discipline) who has ever felt that their work is not ""good enough.""
Finally, I find that the less creating I do, the more doubting I do instead. I'm much more self-critical when I haven't produced anything in awhile. Creating one small thing each day, no matter how crappy it turns out, helps me have just a smidge more confidence in my abilities as a whole. "
3455,isfp,"yeah I set very high standards for myself and when I can't meet them immediately get very frustrated with myself. I sometimes lack the drive to continue on. I guess we just need to push through sometimes. you can't get better until you practice, I gotta remind myself that constantly.
I even have this issue with video games sometimes. if the learning curve is to great i get frustrated and don't push through.  I even have this issue with returning to something like halo. I get frustrated because I'm usually quite good, but need to get back into the swing of things after leaving it for awhile."
3456,isfp,"A nice reply. I agree, finding and operating within constructive circles is the best way to go. It's just the finding of these people/circles that is the difficult part. Your recommendation of taking classes is duly noted. Thank you. What type of painting do you practice??"
3457,isfp,"Sounds like the ramblings of a bitter loner tbh, but I guess I couldn't expect much more from an article based only on one person's experience and the stereotype of extroverts being superficial... 
People with a wide range of interests or busy lifestyles tend to have multiple ""groups"" or ""buddies"" (friends from school, friends from work, neighbors, friends from hobby A, friends from hobby B, workout buddy, concert-going buddy, etc). And in those groups, they may only have 1-3 good friends but that adds up to quite a lot when you have multiple groups. "

3459,isfp,"I'm wanting to take right action (think of that ""Just do it!"" meme or breaking from routine but not making the new thing a one-time thing), but I pussy foot my way around it. It's like trying to run into a cold shower. You work yourself up and run in there like William Wallace, but then you run away like a pussy. There's a barrier in the way.
I think just ""being"" by emptying my mind with no goal and being present-oriented should work, but the question is how do I become present-oriented? How do you do something with no goal in mind? What's the purpose of doing something with no goal in mind?
I found this, but it doesn't exactly explain how to enter the state of mind (Introduction, Defining ""Action"", and 5 Actions to Becoming an Action-Taker will give you the gist of it):
https://startupbros.com/overthinkers-guide-taking-action-complete-guide/
I'm an INTP by the way. Ti-Ne-Si, especially Ne-Si, is a bitch when it comes to breaking from routine. It's good at building routine, but what happens is you adapt and then get stuck. Ne is the ""In a sec"" function while Si is the conservative ""must make no mistakes"" function. Ne can take action, but it just chases reward and only does so if it gets it soon and if little to no conscious effort is required. Si can take action if it's routine."
3460,isfp,"There isn't a ""how"" component to ""just do it"" -- it's the opposite of figuring out the steps and reasons and purpose and strategy and justification and explanation, etc etc. It sounds to me like you're trying to solve your overthinking issue by thinking about it even more. 
Being present-oriented doesn't mean you don't have any goals. If the idea of a looming goal paralyzes you, then maybe it'd help to suspend the end goal in favour for a smaller one that you can deal with now. Just as an example: for me, the thought of failing can be overwhelming at times, especially when I'm trying something new. What helps me is to treat what I need to do as data-gathering (questions can come after. does this approach work? why, why not? what's a better way?), rather than a straight-up attempt at success. This is just what works for me; it takes a lot of the inner pressure off. You gotta find what works for you. Keep on trying."
3461,isfp,"Figure out what you want to do. That's your goal. Now have that at the back of your mind without thinking about the details of what exactly that would entail. As long as you know it's not going to hurt you significantly if you fail, worrying about specifics will only get in the way of putting things in motion. If you need to think about something, thing about something unrelated to the task at hand, or suppress your Ne by observing physical things with Se (not sure how well this would work for you but that's how I do it). That's the best I can explain for ""entering the state of mind"" of present-oriented action taking.
Using the cold shower analogy, this is how I'd do it. I know I want to go in the shower, but thinking about going in there makes me shiver and hesitate. I shake my head to reset my train of thought and focus on the sound of the running water. That's all I'm thinking about, just the white noise of drops steadily hitting the tile. I take a step towards the shower. My mind switches focus to my leg, but I'm still not thinking about the temperature of the water. I start walking into the shower, my mind focusing on the rhythm of my steps until I'm in the shower. Fuck, it's cold, but I'm in here now so coming out would be a waste of all the effort it took to get in, so I force myself to endure the pain. Eventually my body adapts and the cold no longer stings. Mission accomplished."
3462,isfp,"At least for things you can't back out of once you start (asking someone out, signing up for something, etc.), you should only need to convince yourself to do the first step. Don't think ""I'm going to ask my crush out now"" think ""I'm going to say hi and ask if they've ever been to x place."" Once you've started something like that the path of least resistance becomes to continue."
3463,isfp,"There's a ""how"" component to everything. ""Doing"" is a state of mind. If one knows how to enter that state of mind, they can do so. I don't know how to enter that state of mind. SPs are great at entering that state of mind. That's why I'm asking ISFPs. I tried ISTPs, but I've found ISFPs communicate on a more compatible frequency.
I suppose I should ask ""How does one take right action (Se action)?"" So far, I've gotten ""Just 'be' by emptying your mind with no goal and being present-oriented."" That seems contradicting and lacking in information, though. How can one do something without a goal in mind? How does one become present-oriented?"
3464,isfp,"Did you get to read the second half of my post? I did try to shed some light in a practical way on the idea of being present-minded. If you could tell me where it was unclear or not applicable to what you're asking, I can try explaining it differently/respond in a way that's hopefully more relevant. On another note,
I...disagree. You're right in the sense that there's a ""how"" in everything, but here's the way I see it...try blinking manually. Unnatural, but doable, right? Yet even when you're thinking about blinking, you're probably not consciously commanding your eyelids like, ""Within the next few seconds you're going to close briefly. Make sure you're in sync. Tear ducts on standby for lubrication. Eyelashes confirming all-clear. Ok, now open back up. Remember to stay in sync. Tear ducts standing by. Pupils engage. Re-focus. Blink has now been executed successfully."" 
Yes, there's a ""how"" to blinking, but getting caught up in the mechanics of the process is unnecessary and cuts down on your efficiency at the given task. State of mind is important, but your mind is only a part of you. Try trusting your body also; try trusting your heart. I'm not saying to put aside your mind, but all these parts of you are there to help each other. They work better together."
3465,isfp,"Right action, Se action, not just action. Spontaneous action different from routine. Anyone can take action. That's not hard. Right action is like jumping into a cold shower for the first time. It's like suddenly choosing to read a book for the first time in years or suddenly deciding to exercise for the first time in years. It's like deciding to write a book and just doing it.
This is difficult for INTPs due to being Se PoLR, Ne being their 2nd function, Ti their first, Si their 3rd. They're conservative (sort of a just in case, if all else fails thing), constantly thinking and reasoning, persuaded by reasoning, and future-oriented, typically by a few seconds. All the things necessary to avoid for right action are the things they're normally doing.
I entered a state of right action or Se once. I'm not sure exactly what I did. I was truly present-oriented, not present-oriented like people say. That's not true present-orientedness. That's just limiting your future/past-orientedness to a smaller range. True present-orientedness is being in the moment. I set my intention and took action.
How do I enter that state again? I think I'm supposed to just ""be"" by emptying my mind with no goal and being present-oriented, but that's open-ended advice, considering I don't know how to become present-oriented and not have a goal. My goal will be not having a goal. That's contradictory."
3466,isfp,"To be honest, all the MBTI terms are kind of going over my head, but I can address emptying the mind. You're right, consciously trying to empty your mind doesn't exactly work as described. Even in meditation, it's not something you do right off the bat (or at all, I'd argue. I think it's a rather misleading turn of phrase). 
When it comes to meditating, what I was taught to do was to focus intently on something. It could be the sensation of your breathing, the sound of someone's voice, or an image you visualise. It's not about not thinking of other things, but rather, when your mind wanders, to continually bring it back. This might only lead to the type of ""present-oriented like people say"", but I don't believe that and being ""truly present-oriented"" are unrelated. Like anything, it needs to be cultivated."
3467,isfp,"I invested wisely when I was younger and saved up a lot of money from my job straight out of college. As a ""starving artist"" type, I quit my job because I felt 40 hours a week was just too much. Wake up early tired as fuck, commute on a ghetto bus for almost an hour, go to work, talk to people through messenger only, commute back on a bus, walk my dog, cook dinner and relax, by then I have maybe an hour to do my hobbies, but I usually go to the gym since it's pretty much necessary. What the fuck? I can't believe this is how people live. On weekends I usually have to grocery shop, get my car fixed, take my dog to the vet, go to the gym, or have a social life for a friday/saturday night. By then, I STILL have no time for my hobbies.
I want to learn how to skateboard, make music, play more instruments, volunteer, travel, build my own house eventually, start my own business, meet new people, join gymnastics, lift, join an orchestra, learn to cook better, make funny videos for Youtube. Etc etc etc.
So, I quit my job. I have enough money to live a year or two without working. Believe it or not, I STILL don't have enough time to do all this!! It's the most frustrating thing in the world. I recently graduated with my Bachelor's degree last month, so I thought okay, this will free some time up, but no, there's always SOMETHING. 
My typical day is wake up, shower, walk my dog, go to the gym, by then it's time to make some food, so I do that and dick around on Reddit for a while. Then either my friends want to hang out or I go to the skatepark or play piano, then it's time for dinner. I eat and catch up on Youtube subscriptions. I go to the gym. Dog needs another walk. By now it's about midnight, day is done. It NEVER seems like enough time! I want to do everything. This is what a day looks like when nothing urgent comes up, such as car needs to go to the shop or friend is having a panic attack or sister wants to call and catch up for a couple hours. 
I'm wondering if any other ISFPs feel this way, like there's just never enough time. I also hate it when people ask what I do for a living because I never know what to say! I just want to live without a job for a while, is that so wrong? It bothers me that people work to live and live to work, but even if we didn't work there's just not enough time to do what I love."
3468,isfp,"Ugh you have NOOOO idea how much I relate to this. I loathe working 40 hours at a tedious job, sorting at a desk all day. But I know if I actually had that free time, I'd use it sleeping in and goofing off on the internet instead of being productive, unless some outside force makes me do something else. I have serious self motivation issues when there's no sense of urgency to get things done."
3469,isfp,"That's because the problem was never your job. It was your perception and your priorities. I know that because I made the same mistake you did. 
You have your whole life to do anything you want. Saying that there's not enough time is bullshit. Just get started on ONE thing for now and enjoy the ride."
3470,isfp,"I guess you're going to have to prioritize what's important, and start saying no to some of those unexpected things that come up.
I've been without a job for 7 years, and even the last one I had was part time. I make passive income online.
Even so, if I let it, things could steal my time if I'm not careful. I had to learn to say no. My phone is always on silent. I turned off most notifications.
Now I'm so lazy some days I just chill outside and watch the birds all day. Time management is still an issue for me too, but I don't like to beat myself up for not being ""productive enough""."
3471,isfp,"I'm one letter different from your type, but still:


""It NEVER seems like enough time!"" - there is no other solution as to say no to some things and to intentionally set time for the things you truly want.


Top content in /r/getmotivated and /r/getdisciplined subreddits can help. For example, this one. 


And you can post your daily/weekly/monthly plans in special threads in /getdisciplined (the link is there in the sidebar) - at the end of the period you get asked by the moderator how did it go. All 4 things (figuring out your list of goals/habits to practice, sharing it publicly, a deadline, and having someone ask your how did you do) have a sobering and motivating effect. 


It seems, there are no strong motivators for you to progress in doing/learning what you want (no need to make money, show off, etc.), so what can help is setting up systems, not goals:


Figure out your aspirations and what daily habits will automatically ensure you achieving/learning what you want. 


Just build those habits. It takes times of course, and there are some guidelines - start small (a short list of small habits - 5min / 1 pomodoro / etc.), use positive wordings, try to stick new habits before/after your existing solid habits or group new habits into morning/evening routines, etc. 

"
3472,isfp,"I can relate a lot. My job had recently become more seasonal, meaning I have weeks off at a time and I should be either finding a new job, learning a new skill or being productive at home. I find myself instead reading books and enjoying the peace and quiet of my home and can't find the time to do anything at all productive. 
I find planning a trip or event puts the pressure on me enough to start working on things that aren't the daily grind. I also have recently scheduled gym classes for the time I would normally be going into work, once I'm out I find things to do, but if I stay home - it turns into a hermit day.  
I have no real advice, just I feel ya.."
3473,isfp,"At this point in my life, I would much rather be working an office job and being busy that having tons of free time. When I was unemployed I got depressed, tired, bored, I actually ended up doing less. I don know my life's purpose but I know I'm not going to find out by having more time, only through experiences and trying new things, and as an isfp it's hard for me to take initiative on my own."
3474,isfp,"me_irl... Hooo man..... All through the week I get excited for the weekend, finally having time to take a look at that new framework or maybe practice an instrument, but then I'm just sitting here on Reddit or playing Overwatch."

3476,isfp,"All my life I've been laughed at, publicly humiliated and abused by family, boyfriends and colleagues. I'm never mean to anyone and I don't understand why I attract abuse. People instantly dislike me. I am always nice to people and at the age of 35, I want to give up on life. 
Everyone turns against me except for one friend, an INFJ. She is the only one who knows me and looks out for me and has never once been mean to me. 
I want to end it because I don't understand why it keeps happening. It feels partly due to low self-esteem, misogyny, and lack of love. I have crooked teeth which makes me very self-conscious so my smile is off. Is this why they hate me? I only want friends. Why do I keep attracting it? 
I don't know how to fix things. Is it an ISFP thing were I just can't spot things accurately so they keep happening? 
What's the point in living?"
3477,isfp,"It seems to me you suffer from a history of emotional abuse/neglect and childhood trauma. I understand your struggle with self-esteem issues. It is very debilitating, as much as it is a hindrance from reaching your to true potential. I don't think people dislike/hate you; they are probably just uncomfortable with the poor self-image created from your feelings of inadequacy that are projected onto them. And unfortunately, low self-esteem can attract toxic people into your life. But I agree with the comment above, that you should focus on self-love. It is very important that you learn to truly love/accept yourself (flaws and all) before you can move forward and give/receive love because you would always feel like you are not enough. I would recommend counseling/talking to a therapist about your issues and choose the best one that would be patience with you and work with you step-by-step, if you haven't not seek professional help yet. I also suggest reading self-help books/articles to put your doubts/fears into perspective. I don't know you but I do believe you have the inner strength to endure all the obstacles that life had thrown at you and build emotional resilience. So, do not give up on yourself please.
edit: grammar"
3478,isfp,"Go! You are the best! I am also an ISFP and I appear sometimes when other ISFPs are in need... I've been bullied too at school, but things change... Have Hope please, and DON'T DO ANY harm to yourself, save your life, for the partner who will really love you, don't let him be alone without a soulmate, lovely children of yours may not exist if you choose to end your own life... I recemmend you (if possible) if you have faith tendecies, trust Jesus Christ and See how you will never commit suicide... Your Life will be more important...
And I want to say something that you really need, it may feel weird:
I LOVE YOU! Even if I am stranger but based on my experience, I still need to be Loved so I can really feel your need to be loved... Please believe in yourself!! (and if possible believe in GOD).
FORGIVE YOURSELF too!
You deserve that Self Forgiveness and Love..."
3479,isfp,"I went through similar thing. At my last job I quit because of a bunch of bullies. I think people can tell who they can bully. So, after problems with everyone in my life every day for a decade, I began to pray to God and one day I had a wake up. I asked myself the question, what would happen if I just stopped defending myself? I believe God answered my prayer. I am healing inside and in my life every day. It is true that you have to have self-love because we must love our neighbor as Ourselves. That's not so easy to do. You need help but you probably don't love yourself enough to even ask for it. My mother is also narcissist so it is a very difficult situation to say the least but I have the same story, I am so sorry for you because I totally know how you feel but it is nice to know that I'm not the only one very lonely person that has to live with the past and the present and future with a narcissistic mother. This I can say, we are strong people. I always say I don't know how I ended up not dying of a heroin dose already... never touched it. Just to kill the pain and emptiness but I have had a relationship with God for years. I've always believed He has a purpose for me and that has kept me alive. When I had no one, I turned to books, tv and God. I believe there are people who can love us like we've never been loved but we won't meet them until we love ourselves enough. I avoid all contact with my mother nowadays. Eventually I may try to have a relationship with her but it will be with boundaries or not at all. I have come so far, I honestly hope you stay strong because you are worth it. Anyone that can survive a narcissistic family will surely have qualities that make them formidable. You my dear have the strength and bravery of a lion. And if you can find your way through, I'm confident that you have the ability to make a difference in the world because nothing will daunt you if you can overcome this. As for me, no one will be able to take away my happiness again. You can take everything I have, but you won't take my joy EVER. Now, I'm finding out that my mother didn't teach me a thing. I literally have to google everything to learn everything now. I thought I was a screw up but what I didn't know is that I learned all I know from a tv set! My dad was alcoholic too."
3480,isfp,"Aw babe! Don't give up, the way people have been treating you has nothing to do with who you are as a person or your personality. People are always so quick to judge based on looks or on one's initial demeanor, and I for one have been abused emotionally for being shy as well. The point in living is whatever you make it to be - but there is one. Whether it's the beauty in art or something you create, the excitement of forming new relationships, etc. you have a purpose and you deserve to fulfill it!!
By the way, INFJs are typically pretty fascinated with ISFPs, so if anything that's something you can remember, is that your friend genuinely cares about you for you - just one can make a huge difference. 
Best of luck love <3"
3481,isfp,"Read this and instantly identified...and wanted to ask whether any of your parents had NPD. I see you commented further down that your mother is the narcissist, and you seem to have been the scapegoat child, bullied by the Narc & her army (siblings, family). 
I do believe that we end up being scapegoated in other aspects of life, due to the treatment in our childhood. Almost as if the initial narcissist leaves a marker on us that makes it easier for other narcs to find us throughout our lives.
Would highly recommend therapy, specifically one that deals with PTSD/abuse/Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Also check out the r/raisedbynarcissists sub on here. 
I'm currently going through the same thing and haven't figured it out but I know it's possible. We can't change the abusers in the world,  but we can change the things about us that attract them. Sort of like avoiding bears in the woods or sharks in the ocean using safety techniques. 
I'm not an isfp (isfj) but I definitely think our abuse combined with eye for detail means we are on hyper alert and can see injustice everywhere, which makes it harder to get over, because we equate every injustice with our initial abuse. It doesn't make the adult bullying right or miniscule, but it does make it feel like some cloud or larger pattern of oppression that is too big for us to fight alone. 
It is definitely possible & I would 100% recommend building up an assertiveness plan of action - how to be more assertive about things in general or behaviours you don't like for the people who you want to keep in your life (friends or family wiling to change)/cant remove from your life (colleagues). For everyone else, snip snip. ‚úÇ Loneliness is hard but gets easier with time. Abuse never gets better.
If you ever need to rant or vent, you can message me anytime :)"
3482,isfp,"My parents broke up when I was 5. My alcoholic narcissist mother, sister and brothers called me ugly for years, this has been a massive influence on my relationships with men. Men have used me and also called me ugly. I've been told I'm co-dependent. My job is quite interesting, I'm a journalist, which is known for being harsh. But maybe I'm not suited, as an ISFP, to hard news and a profession that attracts high-functioning psychopaths. 
I agree we all have potential, but I need love first and have never had my needs met. This really depresses me. It's also left a trail of destruction I feel I can never conquer even if I do find a good partner. All thoughts welcome x"
3483,isfp,"I believe it has something to do wi feeling like the odd one out, but I've never met someone that I've truly connected with or shared my values (honesty, loyalty, dependable, supportive). In fact, in recent months I've found myself getting shallowly involved with people completely missing these qualities, after getting hurt I retreat and cut them out. Sure, being alone is better than having shitty people in your life, but it's hard. I feel completely alone other than my coworkers at work."
3484,isfp,"""owner of a lonely heart, much better than an owner of a broken heart...""
ISFPs tend to be of the ""authentic"" types:
https://personalityhacker.com/authenticity-as-a-decision-maker/
The opposite is the effectiveness type people, which tend to be much more celebrated especially in western culture. A good idea for ISFPs is to get out and explore more, especially cross-culturally. If able, try traveling, learning another language, or meeting people of other cultures."
3485,isfp,You'll find other people who value the same things you do. It just takes time and maybe a little effort to find more people who get us. I mean I'm not gonna lie I've been having this issue myself but it's better than sticking around a toxic environment 
3486,isfp,"Yes, there was a time in college I felt like this. I transferred and met someone I vibed with really well. But he liked me afterwards and I when I found out I couldn't open up to him anymore. Wish we could talk like we used to. 
There are times when you'll feel completely lonely. But sometimes special people will walk into your life. I agree it's better being lonely than having shitty people in your life. Staying true to yourself is important because one day you'll find someone who appreciates you exactly as you are. "
3487,isfp,"I get a sincere vibe from ISFP's. Good on you cutting ties with toxic people. Might be hard now, but if you keep at it and not compromise your values and such you are more likely to form relations with those that appreciate them."
3488,isfp,"I'm an infj male, currently separated from my isfp wife. I was wondering if any of you could provide gentle guidance, insight, or advice into my severely damaged relationship.
The two of us are young mid 23/25, and have been living together in a relationship for about 5 years. Our relationship, even as we are now, I can look back confidently and say how beautiful it was. The affection we showed eachother was inspiring for friends and family, and we just love each other so much. Eventually though... my wife suddenly shut down one day. She became depressed, anxious, and eventually shut me out. She started to change from affectionate and heart warming, to a little cold a kind of mean spirited. very recently she cheated on me and has resolved herself to leave me and be with another man. All of this just came out of nowhere. 
I'm completely heartbroken. The two of us cried in eachother's arms even as we separated. Feelings are still there, and we have been together so long... I understand this was something she chose and is going to do. But, is there any advice you can offer for me to try and salvage what can be salvaged from our relationship together? Honestly. She seems like she's in so much pain, and I worry so much for her. I want her to get therapy or help, but she won't. I feel absolutely no anger towards her, and I only love her and want what's best for her... but I know this decision she made to leave her husband to immediately be with someone she really doesn't even know, is going to hurt her more.
I walk a fine line between pushing her further away, and becoming too obsessive and unrealistically hopeful. I desperately don't want a divorce with her. What can I do to help her, have her in my life, and make the best out of this horrible situation?"
3489,isfp,"I would let things go for a while. Give each other say like a week alone to recover. Then meet up again and talk about the situation and each others feelings. If she still doesnt want to talk to talk to you, you should accept that she isnt going to change her mind. We ISFP's are very stubborn and she wont change her feelings easily after shes committed. Try to keep contact on a very casual level though, so she knows you are still around in her life. :) good luck"
3490,isfp,"I notice you keep talking about your wife's pain, but what about yours? She is the one who cheated on you and broke your heart. Yes, it may be from the depression and the anxiety, but there's a limit to how much sympathy you can have for that without it taking a toll on your own sense of self. 
If she wanted to stay with you and mend things, your sympathy for her pain would be a great asset. Forgiveness is very powerful. But she doesn't want to stay with you. In this situation, identifying so strongly with her pain is only going to further your own. It makes you keep wishing that she will see how you are so forgiving, compassionate, and giving that she will come back to you. And you will be disappointed, I think. Eventually when you realize this is not just a hiccup, that she really is leaving you, you will feel that anger. I think the best thing to do is to tell her that you hurt for her pain but that she has hurt you just as much or more. Write her a letter about how you feel. Give her your blessing, but do not give her more. Take time and space away from each other.  Do not try to help her find therapy or worry about how to help her unless she comes to you, apologizes, and asks for your help in mending your relationship. "
3491,isfp,"INTJ female here with an ISFP husband. Much of what you describe sounds familiar to me. The first 10 years or so, everyone was in awe of our deep love and ""perfect marriage."" But my husband was suffering from major depression and anxiety, and going untreated, it just got worse until it came to a head. We had a rough few years including several suicide attempts and hospitalizations. Somewhere in all of that I found my husband was secretly trying to reconcile with his prom date from 20 years ago. It was just so out there I couldn't believe it was real. It had to be the depression. The key was to treat it and consider the ""cheating thoughts"" as a symptom. So that's what I did. He is getting help, recovering, and we are on a hold until he is well enough to work on the marriage part. I know how hard it is. Good luck. "
3492,isfp,"I'd also recommend giving her time, but make sure she knows that you are there for her. In the meantime, can you try to think back to the events that led to her shutting you out? I don't think people just ""shut down one day."" Most likely, many things were building up. "
3493,isfp,"Thanks for being honest. Man.. I know it's not over yet but. I'm so heartbroken right now. I'm just. ... I'm gonna miss her so much. We spent 6 beautiful years together. This all happened out of nowhere. It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from. My poor love.. she's hurting so badly. And I'm just not ready to say goodbye.
Thanks again skul. Sorry for breaking down a bit."
3494,isfp,Your story holds striking resemblance to mine... Wow. This is incredibly insightful. I sincerely hope everything works out for you. These are incredibly rough times for us. Good people suffer and can do terrible things. My wife is with her family right now. I think they are going to try and help her as best they can. But at the moment she has her heart set on running off across the country to be with the guy she cheated on me with and met online. Sigh. Thanks so much for sharing though. I'll keep on being as supportive as I can I suppose...
3495,isfp,"Yeah. It's similar to as ArtyKay's story below. She slowly over time started suffering from depression. Her friendships would begin to fall apart little by little, and each time they did instead of looking into why, she would doorslam them. I felt like she kept running away from issues in her life... past struggles with parents, broken friendships, ect.. Eventually her depression and anxiety spun out of control, she shut down completely and spent 100% of her time on the computer. and then I found her cheating on me."
3496,isfp,"Junior year. Had been hanging out with a girl for a few weeks. Was out at my favorite fishing spot with her. She made the move. Ended up not fishing and made out for a while. Had no idea what to do, and was too scared to try anything fancy.  Also it clearly wasn't her first rodeo. Yeah. Turns out she never even liked fishing. Split up after high school. Probably for the best though. Looking back I would have certainly gotten a Dear John letter. Better off having those memories untarnished."

Then it happened. A few times. It all seemed super romantic to me. Though, looking back, he wasn't really worth kissing. xD"
3501,isfp,"2nd grade. It was actually the best kiss I ever had. Maybe because it was the first. I got tingles all over my body. It was during recess.
Her name was Angel. We were holding hands and walking. We walked toward a secluded area then I gently pushed her onto the brick wall and lifted her leg onto my hip and went in for the kiss. Some tongue action went down as well.
Lol. Yeah. "
3502,isfp,"I have the Fi trait isfp, I can tell you that when someone around me is feeling a certain way(usually closer relations to me) I am able to instantly ""put myself in their shoes"". Others emotional energy effects my own, it's amplified in a group setting. Also, my first reaction to my environment is a feeling rather than a thought. The majority of my ""thoughts"" are feelings that encapsulates all of the related thoughts at once yet it appears in my mind as a feeling(sorta like an interactive color palette in a cloud of light) It's extremely difficult to put into words. "
3503,isfp,"Hello ISTP, this is INFP.
When I look at the world around me I consider how it makes me feel. For example watching Rick and Morty makes me feel bad. It's far to nihilistic for me. So as a result I consider it to be hazardous for people who are sensitive or depressed. While the logical conclusion is that nihilism should convince one to not care and thus conquering depression, I believe telling yourself that no one matters in the grand scheme of things is unhealthy because of the message at face value and that it is counterproductive. This is the best example of how I form values with Fi.
When it comes to emotion I can read it like book and place it back out into the world in the form of poetry, music, or astetics. I do this by understanding how I feel and associating words, notes, or colors with emotion and assembling it.
When it comes to social situations my Fi allows me to understand the emotional states of others as a priority. I can empathize easily because of this which gives the INFP it's characteristic ""healer trait"". Empathy is the starting point from which I counsel others.
Honestly I could go further, but it's late I hope I helped you out. r/INFP has a lot of traffic. I'm sure they could give you more answers if you want. :)"
3504,isfp,"Thanks for the reply. I just recently learned about all this stuff. Alot of my family and a girl I date, and others I know are either Si(with Fe) and Fi(with Se) ....so just trying to relate to them all a lil better."
3505,isfp,"I am an ISFP, sometimes ESFP if I have to adapt to the situation but always ISFP at heart, checked everywhere from website to website. It checks out. 
My issue is anger, I really dont understand whats going on. I dont understand why at the outside im calm (but anxious and nervous af) but inside angry and tantrous af. Then after the event has happend I talk to the person/s through a private message and talk all the shit they done to me.( Is that weird?) Then they ghosted me and I get angry even more then I slept, The next day the anger in my heart has left and Im left with the memory of me getting angry in my PM. And now I regret it. (How do you control your anger and is it normal what I did) "
3506,isfp,"Try meditation. It will teach you to recognize your anger when it arises and deal with it right there instead of the morning afterwards. Download the app ""headspace"". They have a specific course of guided meditations for anger. It helped me a lot. (Not with anger issues but other emotional issues.)"
3507,isfp,"HE'S SO HOT AND COLD. 
We met twice. We spent 2 nights together, held long conversations until 3am in his car - and I hope I'm not over idealizing things but I did feel a connection. Things were super comfortable with him. 
But after we parted, NOTHING. He never reached out to me (except through Snapchat because we have a streak). When I attempted to text him, his replies seemed, dispassionate? It's been 2 days. Is he not into me or something! "
3508,isfp,"As an ISFP, I will give you my two cents. 
I rarely ever reach out to people, even if I care deeply about them, because I'm very ""detached"" and I don't miss them. I just don't feel it. I'd be there for them if they were in a crisis, I'd reply if they text, but I'd never, ever initiate contact, because I'm often busy doing my things, and generally not a big talker. Also, someone in the comments said face to face interaction is better, and I agree. 
So don't worry so much. Try to reach out to him. If you feel a connection, there probably is one."
3509,isfp,"You have to do a lot of initial moves here, and in person.
I've been with my wife for 12 something years, and still have to gently push her :-)
They have there own little world, or they are just shy...."
3510,isfp,"It could be one of two ways: He could be just as interested and is just playing it cool because he doesn't want to come off intense, or he's not interested. It's annoying, but gentle tugs to get the real answers tend to be a thing. I'm with the other commenter that said you'll have to do all the initiation. "
3511,isfp,"A stormy center in the sun
There is a medley of songs unsung
And a scene of paintings, not a one
Is seen
Underneath an unwashed leer
There is a passion for untold fear
And in a circle of broken mirrors
She stays
Stay right here
There's no way back
You promised me nothing
In trust we lack
The facade in your grin
Close hearts will see
Please tell me
Will you stay here at home with me?
Drinking it in to relieve the pain
Anger inside can't contain
If you'll stay, you can even say
It's me
He gives a growing tree
To end your destiny
When the bottle falls, your fate will be
Unknown
Stay right here
There's no way back
You promised me nothing
In trust we lack
Do not go
As my face will be
A flowing river
Please stay here at home with me!
The glimmer falls from that eye
It is time to say goodbye
The feeling numbs and you shoot to fly
Away"
3512,isfp,"I write poems when I am feeling particularly angsty or when I feel super great and glowy. Here are a few.
1
Hey, girl. 
I hope you‚Äôre doing alright.
I want to hold your hand
and peek into your eyes.
Your skin is vibrant.
Your hair is sweet.
I‚Äôll hug you all over.
If your life is looking down,
we can do this together.
Come with me, now.I‚Äôll take you by the wrist
and run with you
‚Äòcause if we‚Äôre both here,
there‚Äôs nowhere we can‚Äôt be
We‚Äôll rest on a high cliff
to see what we‚Äôll see
we‚Äôll wonder about their lives
but mostly, we‚Äôll just be
2
Miss me, Miss me please take me back
Don‚Äôt leave me here in this pile of trash
Let me do a twirl
Watch while I spin
Fuck you, I don‚Äôt want you
Stop coming back. 
You need to die, you need to burn
Go over there and this dial I will turn
Feel that heat
it shall simmer
Fuck you, ashes
You don‚Äôt deserve an urn. 
There was another that I completely forgot about. It makes me laugh a bit to see some of the older ones."
3513,isfp,"Edit: I took it on a different site and got INFP this time, with P being massively larger than J and N being only slightly higher than S... Online surveys are probably not the best way to go about this, huh "
3514,isfp,"Yeah, I could agree that online surveys aren't always always the best way to go about it. However, you don't have to define yourself by which personality type you get as opposed to what you got at another time. I would say read through the personality types and their characteristics, and find out which one you think you fit into best. I was given 4 different possibilities of what type I may be when I first took the test, read through them, and determined that I fit into ISFP the closest.
It could also be true that you did, in fact, change a bit over time. You might have changed some of your views on things since the last time you took the test, and things changed slightly.
Honestly, I wound't think too much into it if I were you. As I said, you don't have to define yourself by what result you get. Don't worry too much about it; just do you"
3515,isfp,"Im both istp and isfp, I feel like I might belong slightly more on isfp though (don't tell /r/istp ;) ) I feel like I don't want to place myself as either one as I'm still young, and I haven't really developed who I am as a person yet."
3516,isfp,"Yeah, it is just a survey. I think your answers may vary depending on how you feel too. I took this test several months ago and got ESFP. I think I was just feeling more social back then, and ISFP seems a bit more accurate to how I see myself. "
3517,isfp,"I'm trying to establish if one of my friends is an ISFP. 
I'm an ENTJ male (gender doesn't matter - hello duals!) and to my knowledge, I have never known anyone who is an ISFP. That is, until I started hanging out again with a male friend that I used to chill with a lot, but stopped in high school because he moved. We've been chatting over text and phone a lot. 
Anyway, I know the archetypal ISFP is an artist. But this guy is a programmer, and to my knowledge has never dabbled in art or music or anything of the like. In his own way, I think programming is his art. Does anyone know an ISFP programmer for which this might be true? 
He also lives by a rigid value system and is extremely non-materialist. Everything he does, he evaluates it through his value system, wherein he values social good and benefit for others over simply making money. He makes money off some of his apps, but has no desire to work for Apple or Google, or start a company with the goal of making profit. He would much rather earn just the amount he needs to live happily and healthy, while using his talents to help others."
3518,isfp,"Also ISFP programmer here. I have somewhat of an art background (photography, and music when I was younger) but like others have said, programming is my art really. I'm content getting my code to work, but I am really much happier when I come up with a clever solution to a problem; it requires a combination of creativity and a deeper level of understanding of the problem."
3519,isfp,"I would suspect ISFP's care about the resulting art and not so much the tools used to product the art. having a brush made out of 5000 year old japanese oak wood is great but an ISFP wouldn't care about all those details since it is simply a tool to dip their paintbrush in and paint a beautiful artwork. I feel similarly about coding, while it feels amazing to make cool and influential apps. I just don't care about the tool (or in this case: programming language, api, etc. etc.)  
I studied Computer Science in college so I am capable of writing code but I never got into CS to become a programmer, I got into it to become a ""software architect"" because I always figured that was a cool way to enrich people's lives.  
However I've learned that writing code is too much of a creative process (art) for me. I value it too much to ever make a career out of. I'm not nearly as efficient at it as a INTP/INTJ (though I've obviously developed many INTP/INTJ traits).   
Knowing code has made it a valuable tool in my toolbox that I currently use in my pursuit towards becoming a UX-Designer (user experience)  
In a way I think ISFP's are the ultimate Software Engineers simply because making software is creation; that is to say: creating something unique from nothing. This in it's nature is art.
However the current corporate model doesn't allow for artistic software engineers due to very structured and rigid processes, deadlines and deliverables."
3520,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and a programmer also. Similar to your friend, I have mostly not worked for large companies and prefer companies that are making some sort of impact on the world for social good. I do have a background in music, however. I majored in music in college, but have always been involved in both computers and music. For various reasons I became less interested in music over the years and more interested in computers, and ended up choosing the latter as a career."
3521,isfp,"I'm an ISFP/INFP (The ""S"" and ""F"" are pretty close for me) who does web development. Thinking in hardcore logic for extended periods of time is like torture for me, but I stick with it because of the ""beauty"" and emotional satisfaction from seeing something work that you built.
I get more excited by front-end, more visual stuff, so I suppose it's artsy in that respect. Ideal careers: pro basketball player, entertainer. Maybe one day."
3522,isfp,"I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.
This is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in r/mbti (unless r/isfp would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ISFPs.
The ISFP survey link:

If you are not an ISFP please find the correct link for your type here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/
‚Äã
Thanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in r/mbti once the survey is completed."
3523,isfp,"I would say deaf because sight is more important, in terms of a more comfortable lifestyle. Although when looking back on the things I'd be giving up it hurts. Music is so important to me... But a sacrifice is a sacrifice."
3524,isfp,"You meant deaf right? Or would you rather be dead than either of the two? Yeah i think i would choose sight over hearing as well. But music is super important to me too, i need it to remind myself of who i am and who i want to be. What kind of music do you listen to? "
3525,isfp,"Lol. Yeah I meant deaf. Haha. I listen to all kinds of music. My playlist goes from Jessie J, to Kendrick, to Lena Chamamyan, to Daft Punk, to Nina Karjlic, to Bollywood, to soundtracks for my favourite games lol. I should probably say I'm an INFP btw."
3526,isfp,"Let me explain why...
Everywhere I look on forums,blogs,pinterest,etc. I see the same boring things said about ISFP's. The online community favors intuitives not sensors. I am aware now of my intelligence(or lack thereof) and I wish I was at least an intuitive so I can be more intelligent. I feel like all I am good for is being nice and creating art. My husband is an INTJ and now after discovering MBTI I wonder/worry if he views me the same as the majority of people online.
I wish there was a way of changing your type but at the same time I want to be myself. MBTI is liberating but at the same time it's constraining. It's a vicious cycle. Lol 
Just needed to vent!
Edit: Omg thank you all for all the love/comments!"
3527,isfp,"Well luckily for you sensuality, sexuality, athleticism, entertaining personalities, and physical attractiveness matter in the real world, which is where most of us actually spend our time:
INTJ and ISFP is a great match, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it at all."
3528,isfp,"It‚Äôs because the descriptions written for intuitives are written BY intuitives. While descriptions for sensors are generally written by intuitives who have no experience being a sensor. It seems like INFJs and INTJs love to talk and think about themselves (nothing wrong with that, in fact I wish people could be more introspective and self-aware) with the amount of vast information regarding those types of the internet. Sensors just look at the results, go ‚Äúoh neat‚Äù, then continue on with their lives. "
3529,isfp,"I started out not liking my type, but I started using my strengths and now, I‚Äôm so proud to be an ISFP! First off, being present instead of in my own head all the time really helps with games, whether it be physical or video. I realized how quickly I pick up on instruments; I can play 7 so far pretty well, and am currently learning another one. I have the talent of taking my emotions and putting it either into music or through art, which seems to really impress people. Anytime I show someone a piece of art or music I‚Äôve created, the response is usually, ‚ÄúI wish I could draw/play piano, etc‚Äù (I hope that doesn‚Äôt sound too vain). I‚Äôve also realized that ISFPs are pretty intuitive and philosophical people for Sensors, at least I am. ISFPs are awesome in my opinion! Really the only downside is socializing and taking everything personally.
Edit: I forgot to add that we LOVE learning new things. There‚Äôs no lack of information here, so there‚Äôs the rebuttal to the ‚Äònot as smart‚Äô statement"
3530,isfp,"(INFP) - I don't know if it helps change your perspective at all, but I heavily envy ISFPs in many ways. ISFPs seem more in touch with the here and now, which I think gives them a better sense of taste and in some cases more athleticism. I've also never seen them as less intelligent. I don't think intuitives are more intelligent than sensors, I think they just favor a different kind of mental process. If anything, I think ISFPs have an edge over INFPs as far as actually taking action and getting things done.
I empathize with being disappointed to a degree with your type, because I was at first with mine. I think its really easy to see the grass as greener on another side, though. To me, your grass is plenty green!"
3531,isfp,"Bullshit. Every type has amazing and unique things about them. They are capable of being healthy, productive and successful in their own ways. Each are also equally capable of being immature and unhealthy. 
Also the intelligence thing bothers me. You‚Äôre right there can be some stigma about sensors and intelligence, but the way I think about it is that there are sooo many ways to define intelligence. Sure you have Albert Einstein on one end, but you also have the diligent student who did very well in everything bc she worked so hard (not bc she was naturally a genius) or the boy is an excellent orator and commands the attention of a crowd with all the random knowledge he has acquired. Or you have the girl who has the most amazing emotional intelligence and can read any mood in the room and help people work through their issues. Intelligence isn‚Äôt one thing and there isn‚Äôt only one answer.  
MBTI can we a good way to recognize your weaknesses and figure out how to work on them, as well as identify your strengths and own those. "
3532,isfp,"I understand what you mean. I struggle with the fear of people I care about thinking I'm dumb, thats a normal ISFP thing to worry about.
Something to look into are the functionally stacks of an ISFP. Everyone has all funtions, just in different orders. We have Fi (intraverted feeling) Se (extraverted sensing) Ni (intraverted intuition) Te (extraverted thinking).
We all have all functions, just in a different order. We do have intuition, its just working differently."
3533,isfp,"Remember one thing. Anyone can accomplish anything they set their mind to, regardless of their personality type. And also, everyone is different. Many people of the same personality type do have many things in common, but humans are much deeper than 4 letters. Don't let it put ya in a box mate! "
3534,isfp,"I like ISFPs, actually. For what it's worth many of my favorite people are sensing types. The S does not stand for ""stupid"", I have yet to meet a Sensing type that I have found to be legitimately stupid, sensors just process the world differently. That's it. 
Fuck the online mbti world, it has little to zero relation to reality. I created my own mbti subreddit for a damn reason, I got sick of the damn circle jerk of shitting on sensors among many other things. 
Also, I don't like being an ENTJ all the time. 
Stereotypes, I don't like them much myself. I'm an artistic and musical ENTJ. Not the stereotype of a robotic, cold, narcissistic CEO or whatever it is this week. 
Also, you would be amazed at how many people will say a genuine ENTJ is ""mistyped"" for having emotions or for having the capacity for empathy. It's insufferably irrational and downright stupid. "
3535,isfp,"One thing I have to say about not being intuitive in regards to not being intelligent. I lose almost every board game the first time I play, but I win almost every time after two or three plays of it. I used to hate that I couldn't just look at a game, and understand what I needed to do to maximize my odds of winning. I did a weekly board game meetup at a game store for three years. Always did poorly with each new game, but would crush at anything I had played a few times. We are smart. Its just a different kind of smart."
3536,isfp,"I haven't read the comments yet so I may change my mind about it but I lol'd when I saw your post OP because I'm in the same boat as you... I remember two weeks ago when I went on r/mbti and saw this thread about what mbtitypes has the most subscribers, and we are like 10th out of 16 or so... way behind the ""monsters"" that are the IxNx. Damn I'm almost 50/50 on N/S on 16personalities, me too sometimes I wish I was definitely ""N""..."
3537,isfp,"No way, isfps are known as the most logical sensors. Were also, introspective, great at being content with very little and living in the moment. Not everyone likes us, but those who do love us. We're known for our wisdom and ability to see all sides of an issue. We have plenty of strengths. There's a lot to be proud of.
Don't mean to toot my own horn but I'm plenty smarter than a lot if intuitives that I know. I just care about different stuff."
3538,isfp,"I think Michael Jackson was ISFP. Does anyone care? No. He had extraordinary personality and I couldn't care less what his type was, because his character was truly outstanding and he was very very talented. Your type doesn't limit you. You can be feeler and still be very logical etc etc. Being a sensor doesn't limit your intelligence, just like being intuitive doesn't mean you're intelligent. 
What the hell even is intelligence? Being good at math? Being street smart? Does anyone now? Is it even possible to measure it?"
3539,isfp,"I‚Äôm glad you are proud to be an ISFP!!!
My best friend is an ISFP who went to Princeton for undergrad and now is finishing up a doctorate in Occupational Therapy from the top OT program in the U.S.  She‚Äôs smarter than most of my other friends, and she‚Äôs able to balance theory with practicality much better than I can. (I‚Äôm an N)"
3540,isfp,That's interesting because I envy INFP's. The ones I know are so interesting and smart. They are also pretty funny! My sister is INFP. I think we both envied different things about eachother. I liked how easily she could speak about things to people. I suck at communicating lol
3541,isfp,"Yup, also some people have the 2nd and 3rd functions really balanced, especially as one gets older and you have to work more on the 3rd because of life things. So you really aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúJust‚Äù a sensor, and N‚Äôs aren‚Äôt really ‚ÄúJust‚Äù intuitives. We all just have some cognitive preferences certain ways! "
3542,isfp,I think ISFPs and INFPs make an excellent team. The ISFPs I knew when I lived in Oregon brought out the best in me. They helped me let go of some of my internal focus and just live. I really appreciated that. 
3543,isfp,"Exactly! And knowing how they stack can tell you your strengths and weaknesses. With ISFPs, our Strength is Fi, we have an very strong sense of individuality and very stong morals. Our weakness is Te, we worry so much about what other people think we are weak to group think. "
3544,isfp,"first one is process type, ENFJ prolly
2 seems right
3 is ISJ
4 is FJ
5 is ENP
6 can be anyone
7 is INFP
actually
no
7 can be anyone
8 is forer effect bs
9 is ISFJ textbook
10 is right 11 is right
12 is right
13 is right
14 is absolutely wrong
15 is absolutley wrong, and it is ENP
16 is ISFJ
17 is forer effect
18 is ISJ as fucvk
19 is more ESP
20 is correct
21 is absolutely wrong
22 is INFJ
23 can be almost anyone
24 is straight up fucking cringe
and not ISFP 25 is ESFP(edited)
26 is ISFJ?
definitely not SFP anyway
27 sounds more N-dom, but still too ambiguous and undetailed to make any judgment so I'm gonna leave it at forer effect
28 is correct (carefree type)
29 is just insecurity
30 is correct
31.... Sigh. If there's any type that knows what's socially appropriate the best it's ISFP. Fucking hell. Maybe they are thinking of NTPs or something
32, ok, how the fuck can you tell me they lack the emotional intelligence to figure out just what's socially appropriate then one second later tell me they have so much emotional intelligence they can read people just from subtle body cues? This video is more inconsistent than ISFPs themselves. But yes #32 is correct.
33 can be anyone
34 is incorrect
35 is forer effect
Conclusion: 9/35 are correct. MBTI understanding of ISFP seems to be either my understand of ISFJ overall or just throwing words around."
3545,isfp,I‚Äôm an ISFP and I feel like I can be pretty competitive though other people wouldn‚Äôt notice it. It‚Äôs more like I just have the tendency to turn small things into a competition in my head and enjoy ‚Äùwinning‚Äù. But I won‚Äôt let it show. That might be just a personal thing that I do though. 
3546,isfp,"That‚Äôs definitely a thing I do sometimes. I‚Äôll compete over the dumbest things, sometimes with myself and sometimes with strangers who have no idea we are in competition. It just makes things interesting sometimes and can give boring tasks some measure of excitement."
3547,isfp,"What's with this cornering? There's way too many of them in his comment and Lastrevio is an ENTP, so I don't trust his understanding of ISFPs to be sound and unbiased in the first place. And a lot of his ""points"" sound like personal opinions anyways. I'm not here to debate the whole thing.
edit: But for the sake of it, I can try explaining #32: 
ISFPs don't really adapt socially (as well as Fe users do) but they can adapt on an individual level. They see the individual's needs (Fi) before the group's needs (Fe). Therefore they can be better at seeing cues in the individual people they meet, not the overall social atmosphere. ISFPs can be quite socially inappropriate, me being an example."
3548,isfp,"Nah. I mean, sometimes, yeah, but he already claimed he ""fucking hates ISFPs personally"" so it makes me a bit suspicious that he's not at least a little biased, coming to an ISFP sub of all the types to disprove the ISFP type, specifically."
3549,isfp,Ive often observed that ENTPs  seem the least aware of their own biases in regards to mbti typing so i highly distrust his idea of what isfp is. Not all of them are like this but yeah ive seen it a lot.

3551,isfp,"Hey guys, I was in serious long term relationship that ended badly but I think I am ready to start dating again. I don't really like trying to pick up random girls as bars and clubs as it makes me feel fake and nervous. I feel the only way I am going to meet someone is if they initiate and girls hardly do that. Do you guys have any advice when it comes to meeting people? "
3552,isfp,"I am a musician and i have noticed that a lot of people approach music like an Si dom would: very ritualistically, seeking advice from ""the experts"", etc. 
For me it is a lot of work to copy someone elses' style and I don't see the point of it. It is hard to imagine how people aren't creative and still want to be musicians, since music is about creativity and emotion. It seems easier to be creative in the first place, all you have to do is move random shit together until it seems cool"
3553,isfp,"Our main Fi function allows us to feel deeply in all aspects of life, which in this case is music. However the creation part that comes easily to us in mainly aided by our Ni. I'm a visual artist and I get these random spikes of creativity from the most random things in life. I like to ""copy"" a style, which i would refer to as practise more than copying, for the sole purpose of understanding it and learn the logic behind it. I've recently started learning the piano and after practising some music that inspire me I find myself drifting off in my own tunes. "
3554,isfp,"I've always struggled with presenting to classes, even if it's a small group of 10 people. My voice starts to tremble, I lose track of my thoughts, and my throat gets unbearably wet so I keep swallowing. It all seems to snowball (although in rare occasions it can snowball in the right direction and I do quite well). 
Maybe this has to do with our lack of planning ahead? I don't prepare and I feel underprepared when I get to the presentation. But I also feel like it has to do with my lack of confidence and introversion. Do other ISFPs have this problem?"
3555,isfp,"I've always had the problem where I get nervous and then start talking too fast and end up stumbling over my words. In the last few years, I've been unable to avoid speaking in front of groups. I've found that if I prepare myself with what I want to talk about, but not exactly what I want to say, it helps a lot, along with making it feel to me like I'm speaking super slow. Another thing that helps me is choosing one person to focus on and blocking everyone else out"
3556,isfp,"I absolutely hate doing presentations! I am never fully prepared though so that is probably why. For whatever reason, all the time leading up to the presentation date I will just tell myself, oh this is no big deal, I'll be able to improvise it. Usually the day before the actual presentation I will completely freak out and get upset at myself *for not properly preparing. It's honestly a vicious cycle of self sabotage.
My throat does the opposite. It gets really dry and it makes swallowing harder and annoying.
I always prefer group presentations, even though I typically dislike working in groups. "
3557,isfp,"I'm with you on this. My degree had a presentation aspect for most classes and I found that I never really cracked it until my final year. I found that presentations, for me at least, went better when I just stopped caring too much. Just prepare on the day (depending on how work I had to do, I'd get the notes done the night before and make the PowerPoint the morning of, rather than the week before). 
It's not being underprepared in my opinion, it's just doing everything so quickly that I never had time to process my nerves and therefore I went into 'fuck it' mode and just went for it.
Worked hard on a presentation in second year, got nervous a week prior and got a C. Rolled off a flight from New York to Glasgow, prepped the presentation on the train to uni, delivered the presentation and got an A in fourth year.
tl;dr: the less time I prepare, the less time I have to make myself anxious, and I do better."
3558,isfp,"Really bad, I think it's more of a self doubt thing for me because I usually feel like my presentation isnt good enough. But like besides the self doubt it's still pretty bad I cant stop rocking back and forth, my voice wobbles, my hands sweat like hell and I struggle to breathe tbh. It sucks so much tho like my scores are always lower than the rest of the groups coz I look unsure of the information or some shit like that"
3559,isfp,"I've always handled them pretty poorly, but I think it has more to do with my social anxiety, so I may be a poor example. My dad is an ISFP and he always does presentations for his job...oddly enough, he's found that if he doesn't get any sleep beforehand (he usually procrastinates and finishes it the night before), and goes into the presentation really tired, he does better. It probably has to do with the fact that he's too tired to be nervous. Basically, if you're not nervous beforehand, you'll do better - basic life principle."
3560,isfp,"I'm in the middle of my exams right now and looking at my peers study so consistently for long stretches at a time has made me wonder if I'm the only one who can't sit myself down. My friends can remain undistracted for hours on end and I can barely resist the urge to keep myself from procrastinating. I realise this isn't just with academics, but with other IRL stuff too. 
I thought you guys would have similar experiences and was wondering how you managed to work around/deal with it?"
3561,isfp,"I procrastinate unless i REALLY care about something (which is rare). My advice: start chasing the things you really really care about, and deadlines will still be annoying, but you'll likely be drawn to complete your projects/assignments if the reward is exciting novelty (even if you still procrastinate a little). School sucked for me for the very same reason as yours, i dropped-out my engineering studies and i'm persuing something more hands-on. Had to complete high-school though :')"
3562,isfp,"Having some loose structure helps compensate when I'm doing work I'm not passionate about. Often that means taking short breaks often (either once I've done X amount of work, or a spent a set amount time working). But what's more important here is having a defined end to the break, or else I'll get lost in that and never return to my work, lol.
That said, these aren't exactly rules or anything. Whenever I'm having trouble focusing, I know it's time for a break, regardless of the above-mentioned stuff. Or if I've got a good momentum going, I'll just go with it. But those guidelines help reel me back in when my self-direction falters."
3563,isfp,"I usually wait until the last couple days to get it done. Not the last day, but maybe the day before.
I wait because I have a hard time focusing, too. When I become focused, I go into ""focus-mode"" and I don't like to waste it. So I wait until I have enough time and energy to go into focus-mode and then I get it done. When I start having trouble focusing, I take a break. A pretty simple break, like I don't do anything that requires too much focus or else I'll get into ""focus-mode"" on that and waste time. 
So my advice is when you start getting distracted, take a short, simple break. good luck with your exams!"
3564,isfp,I like to do things quickly so I'm free later. I only procrastinate if I don't have energy or really don't want to. Resting a bit after getting some work done and then going back at it helps me to keep getting what I need done.
3565,isfp,"Great advice, I do the same. Without an exact deadline (or one that is far off) I need to distract myself, working in bursts of momentum. As the deadline approaches I'll really start to kick it into high-gear. That being said, I was a terrible test taker - I always preferred projects that were able to visually show my skills.
Nowadays I work at a landscape architecture // urban design firm, specifically, designing graphic renderings, 3-D modeling, and spatial layouts. It's everything I could want."
3566,isfp,"Realizing how unusual this paring is, and even moreso when it comes to long term success, I figured it would be cool to make an AMA. So, anything you guys want to know about INTJ female and ISFP male pairings, ask away. We've been married for many years, have 2 children, and it is a strangely complimentary relationship now but the early days were brutal....TBH, I'm surprised we made it even."
3567,isfp,"Currently an INTJ boyfriend with an ISFP girlfriend actually. So I guess I've a few curious questions, some practical, some just for fun:


How exactly did you get married? With a ceremony? How'd that go?


Do you find classic gender roles getting in the way or have you guys dismissed them entirely? Perhaps it's different in my case as the male and she the female, but our types seem more balanced in masculinity/femininity. I find that she is handier than me, typically takes care of most house projects. I try to help with chores and we typically cook together. I own the house and don't ask for rent, so I ask that she take care of groceries and basic house needs. When we go out, I still feel compelled to cover both our meals because that's just the gender expectation. Else I'd like to think there's no concept of the ""man of the house"" nor the ""housewife"", just two partners figuring it out together, but this seems more difficult for other people to accept. 


If you don't mind getting even more personal, how has the whole children thing worked out in general? What role do you each play in their lives? I somewhat fear the idea of having children yet accept that it's entirely likely and not something I'll always dread as I age. I don't know how supportive I'd be of them, but I'd want to raise them to be independent and creative individuals. 


Have you found success in motivating your partner to do anything? Beyond favors, it seems hard for us to get each other to actually stick to our goals and projects. Like, I don't want to seem pushy and controlling, but at the same time I really want to see her succeed and to stop complaining or saying ""I really ought to..."".

3568,isfp,"i take it as you are the more robotic one and he is the emotional one? does he make a stand first on things or do you, i.e. someone says something rude to you in a public setting.
i tend to get all emotionny during a breakup and it messes up my whole mentallity for a brief time, and it shows on tests when i take them during said time. i yearn to get back to my robot self. but while im all sensoryfeeler i actually stand up for myself more than usual, where i just let everything slide cause i cant be bothered."
3569,isfp,"Besides the things that come when you combine a life with someone, the usual first year of marriage bumps, I didn't realize that a lot of things that I say plus how I say them were hurtful to my husband and lowkey belittled/made him feel stupid/less than. Add to this the fact that I'm not really an outwardly emotional person, or a touchy-feely person either where he is and needs such things. It blew up into major screaming matches more than a few times on his end, him telling me I made him feel like a room mate, like a child, that I was heartless. I'm sure to him I did feel like all of those things at that time. I in turn would either just walk out the door, get in the car and leave for the day after hearing about myself, or would tell him that yes, I felt he was stupid at times and here is why in detail, or that he was a child at times and here is why in super detail, which in hindsight is hurtful (but wouldn't be hurtful for me to hear about myself if that makes sense). The last big one he ended up in tears and I hate crying, so I locked myself in the bedroom and ignored him for a good while. We had the divorce convo that night, and discussed how we were not meeting each others needs mentally and emotionally, so it was time for hard work or to end things because I was really hurting him, and he was really infuriating me. 
We picked hard work. I've had to learn what it is to give compliments when I don't totally think it is needed so often, how to give positive reinforcement when I myself think someone should be inwardly motivated, not be such a 200% logical person and to not be crushingly blunt and harsh. He's had to learn and adapt as well, but TBH, the fault was more on myself than him for our explosions."
3570,isfp,"No worries, I enjoy questions :)
We got married at 9pm on a Friday, surrounded by people who were being charged with all sorts of petty things or making bail. Yes, we went to see the Magistrate LOL. Our first married couple pic has a chart of narcotics in the background....I prize that thing. Husband wanted a 'real' wedding as per his tradition, which I caved on, we had a ceremony in his home country. The big Moroccan ceremony greatly stressed me, they take 3 full days and have more people than I would ever want to be around at once, dancing, loud music, lots of touching and hugging. AKA, I took xanax to get through it. 
We don't do gender roles in the sense that he is a man, so he must be 'the man' per se. We just do as we do, whatever works for us. I do stay home with the children because I felt strongly that if I had them, I would give my everything to their well being and formative years. But had I been holding a much better job, he would have stayed home. We have combined everything in to a weird collective hive-mind almost. We do what makes sense. 
Ramble warning: Concerning kids, I get your fears. I could write a novel on this. I felt the same, I worried I wouldn't be a good parent. I knew I would be a great care taker, but children you birth require more than just food, shelter, and clothing. I can say I'm glad I have sons because I feel I relate better to them. I am not traditionally supportive, there is no failed but tried, it is OK, there is no 'Oh, you fell, let me cuddle you and dry your tears.' Instead it is me looking at my 9 year old in our quarterly meeting with his teacher telling him its time to wake up and realize failures come from our lack of preparation and caring about the outcome, he should own up and commit to better. I'm always telling my sons that I will be their rock and support along with their own efforts, but mom is not here to carry them through life or be a living short cut. I feel that INTJ parents support our kids in our own ways, which as equally as good as other parents' ways but starkly different. Overall, I have treated them as small people from their infancy and it has paid off. One is 9, and taking coding courses at the local high school, the other is 7 and looking at skipping a grade next year. My husband is the loving dad, I kind of compare him to Gaylord Focker's dad in that sense. Always hugging them, telling them they are special and amazing, encouraging them to know that being a good human is important. This is great, because he does what I do not and vice versa. My sons are emotionally intelligent young men who are compassionate towards others in a way many kids aren't these days, and wise beyond their years thanks to his influence.
I've dealt with this with my husband, the zero motivation. I literally still bang my head against the fucking walls over it, lol. TBH, I've sat him down and told him that if he lets me, I will help guide him to success as best I can, but he can't buck me on the plan once it is in place; The plan can be for her, you, or both. I let him formulate the plan with me and then we locked in. This was after a year or so of him making little headway on his own. Example: My husband's education wasn't equivalent in the states so his career prospects were slim once he left Dinsey; he had to start from the floorboards and it bothered me a lot (his dreamer talk with zero action followed by depression, which was dragging down OUR collective life, my thinking I was saddled with someone less than me who won't ever achieve anything, my fears about pushing him too hard so I didn't push at all) until I did the plan thing. I'm of the thinking that my ISFP husband enjoys my 'control' a little because I've a proven and skilled operator in that sense. I would wager your girlfriend might as well, and you might not come off as pushy as you think if you do it the tactful way. I've also learned that praise along the way is such a good thing for my husband which was a learning experience for me. I work on the grounds that the outcome wanted is both my praise and prize so I push myself for it. But for him, hearing praise along with the push is almost worth as much as the prize or goal itself. My husband needs to hear me say I'm proud of him, he's got this, I believe in him, etc, while I'm nudging him along. "
3571,isfp,"I was in education, currently I am home with the children, he still works in hospitality. I'm also 4yr older than he is. So at the time, he was a legit young one. 
My husband was working at Disney World, and I met him by asking where something in the park was. I was looking at grad school, UCF, and decided to go to Disney World's EPCOT just to say I've been and see if it lived up to the hype. I actually traveled about 13hr to get to Florida for those few days so yea....if fate exists, this is a case of it. 
He explained then off I went to find it. About 5 minutes later he is jogging up beside me in his fucking cast member outfit saying hey, and I'm thinking holy shit, why are you here? So I said a really weird 'Oh, Heyyyy....' to which he points out his nametag, introduces himself, and says he took break time just to look for me and ask for my number if he caught up (I have a lion's head of curly hair, easy to spot). Me being the socially inept person I have always been, asks 'You want my number? Really? Uhhh....sure.....guy I don't know at all"" and send a text to his number from my phone thinking that would be it. 
I think my text actually said something asshole-ish like 'Too bad I'm not coming back to Florida again, LOL' because I wasn't, and he wouldn't get it til he was off work and I was on the road home.
To nutshell it, I thought my text would blow him off because I saw him as a googly eyed, big smiling, barely out of the teens dude. It didn't work. He grew on me in this strange way, I wasn't sure if I liked him or disliked him for a good few weeks. To skip all of the details, we both had really rough break ups about a few months before our weird text friendship began, and we ended up being each other's rebounds. It just happened, I looked at him one day while back in Florida (the irony) and said you know, I didn't like you when I met you, but.....
....but you want to marry me, right? And he had that giant, extra smile that annoyed me so much at first, and follows up by telling me we can get married today even, it would be fine with him because he knew I was 'the one' when he first saw me. 
Goodbye logic, I did marry him that same weekend, he put in his notice and moved to my state a month later. This is coming from someone who didn't believe in the whole 'the one' bullshit, or true love soulmates mess either. I do love him now on a level I can not put to words. But at that time, I knew that this person was white, where I was black, he was heads where I was tails, we felt at ease with each other, and my logic told me this would be an excellent life partner if we put in the work. "
3572,isfp,"The best thing we have figured out is that we are opposites in the truest form save both being quieter people. When a conflict comes up, we have learned that what wife thinks and feels, is probably the opposite of what husband thinks and feels despite us both being able to see the actual issue most of the time. We try to remember that and literally say to ourselves, if I'm feeling red about this, he/she is probably feeling blue. Don't forget they are blue. Let's try and find a way to make purple. God, that sounds like a Kindergarten lesson gone wrong but it works.
If you're talking about conflict already in progress, let it simmer out, and sleep on it if you can. I know this sounds so insane, but my husband will make written lists of his gripes with me now and it works sooooo much better for me than words. So if you're an ISFP, you could try the written approach, but be prepared for feedback. Don't expect a verbal apology, expect to see and be shown the apology.
Lastly, ask for a hug. That works well for us, when he asks rather than expects it, because I've learned ISFPs need this and truth be told, INTJs do as well but we just don't realize it, LOL. "
3573,isfp,"Ah, all very insightful, thanks! It all sounds mostly relatable. I suspect I'll have to be the ""serious"" parent, but I hope they turn out as well as yours then, an ISFP pairing works well for this in that at least they'll have the plenty supportive parent. 
Haha so you're saying that my prediction is true in that I'll probably dread the wedding ceremony as much as I think I will that's pretty much written in stone as far as my GF is concerned. Well, at the least I'll play my hand at making it as nontraditional as possible. 
I'll especially have to try the motivation thing out. I don't want to get into too many details, but a classic one is weight loss. It's a minefield to navigate, to convince someone you love them as they are but also want them to be healthy and content with their own bodies. "
3574,isfp,"I'm ISFP (42M)and this described my relationship with my daughter (19F) perfectly. We are very very close. She now lives in a different state (US) for college, but I'm still the first people she calls after she wakes up. lol ... 
I'm of the thinking that my ISFP husband enjoys my 'control' a little because I've a proven and skilled operator in that sense.
As I've gotten older, I've had to grow in my motivation area. It was very undeveloped when I was younger. It's hard for a person to motivate and be accepting of a SO without veering off into control and dissapointment. very fine balance there. I know in my life I like someone who can motivate me to push myself, but won't be domineering. "
3575,isfp,"No I‚Äôm not ISFP, but I have an ISFP husband. Most times I find that his view of the issue is completely alien from mine! Yes you‚Äôre right, we can both see the issue, but I‚Äôd never have figured out his point of view, if he didn‚Äôt tell me! Being with ISFP has shown me that people are not in fact cut out from the same cloth-I know that theoretically, but it‚Äôs still weird! -I‚Äôm INFJ.
But asking him to write it down, seems like a great idea! He‚Äôs so much more fluent in paper than in person, and it‚Äôs much less confrontational!
I‚Äôll keep that in mind for next time!
Thanks for your well-thought responses!"
3576,isfp,"Agree. That is such a fine line, and as an INTJ I don't see the line often and can spiral into the disappointment realm. We still work on this, and I think it will remain one of our things we constantly have issues with (thank God not like in the first year) and reassess. I also don't try and take the reigns with the pushing anymore, I wait to be asked for 'help' unless it is something huge, which isn't often in the real world. In my world, yes, lol. But I've had to make serious strides about that as well. I'm also 90% sure my younger sister is an ISFP, she hasn't taken the MBTI test yet, and I can attest that as she ages, she has improved her motivation a ton. 
P.S., 
Your daughter is blessed to have a you and vice versa, I'm simply awestruck at parent-child relationships like these. "
3577,isfp,"That made my morning! lol .. thank you! 
I've just had my ADD meds, so im talkative right now LOL .. 
My dad was real distant growing up, so i made the decision early on that I wasn't going to repeat that relationship pattern with me with my daughter. She was going to be close to me whether she wanted to or not, dammit! lol ... 
She's ESFP and I'm ISFP so we just fit really well together anyway. lol .. "
3578,isfp,"I already posted this to the MBTI subreddit and the INFP one, but I was hoping you might have some insight into my problem.
I've been trying to figure out which one of these I am for quite a long time. The cognitive functions are kind of vague and I can't really tell which ones I have a preference for, it seems as if I fit into the INFP and ISFP category. Is there anything obvious that sets the two types apart which could help me out? It'd be amazing if someone could help me with this!
Thanks a lot!"
3579,isfp,"There's no other way than analyzing your function stack to semi-reliably determine your type. Most of my sources are for INTJ functions unfortunately, but I found the following site to have a solid analysis of the functions for each type as well as general information about them:
http://personalityjunkie.com/isfp-type-profile/
http://personalityjunkie.com/infp-personality-type-profile/
It might also help to google how both types would react under stress. Since both types have Te as their inferior function, you'll be better off checking for Fi/Ni loop (ISFP) and Fi/Si loop (INFP) behavior descriptions."
3580,isfp,"These behavioral stereotypes, while they have some truth, aren't reliable enough to distinguish between the two types. As a counter-example, all of the bolded stuff here appies to me and I'm an INFP:
I also know an older ISFP who's quirky, likes deep conversations, and excels in his profession. I think it's more important to look into why you like or are good at certain things than just what you like."
3581,isfp,"I'd say I am pretty much all of those things, except I'm in no way graceful, I do enjoy philosophical discussions and I dont get angry, nor am I competitive at all.
Do you think I could still be an ISFP?"
3582,isfp,"I understand. I wasn't suggesting that that's what you were saying--sorry if it came across that way. 
I'm saying that behavioral type descriptions such as the ones you posted, or even the official ones, are vague enough that it's easy to see yourself in many of them, which limits their usefulness when you're trying to distinguish between two similar types.
What I find more interesting and revealing is how your type can affect the way in which you go about the same thing. For example, both myself and the ISFP I once dated liked hiking, but I found that our interests and motivations around hiking were somewhat different--her way seemed to activate her Se more, while my way activated my Ne."
3583,isfp,"There are two things I don't agree with... astrology/horoscopes, which is what this whole article source comes from, and the fact that the author states ""ISFPS tend not to be very introspective"". I'm intro as fuck, to a fault, maybe just me though "
3584,isfp,"""The ISFP doesn‚Äôt really care if they are understood or misunderstood. They don‚Äôt really care that much about who they are or their true place in the world. Not ambitious that way.""  
Definitely not true for me. I'm the opposite of this. Other than that this was pretty accurate and raw. "
3585,isfp,"I have an ENFP brother and he's awesome. He truly seems like a ''big brother'' type to me (even though he's actually my little brother lol). Must be because of the whole 'supervisor' thing, although don't mean to hype up Socionics too much. I feel like he understands me and the way I am deeply and I never really feel judged by him. He has that teacher/mentor vibe to me meanwhile we also have a lot of fun. I like how laid-back he is, although it can also be a problem at times.    Definitely one of my favorite types to hang out and chill with."
3586,isfp,"One of my long date ""best friends"" is ENFP. I put the quotation marks because through time our relation had really high highs and really low lows. I never knew in which box to him. Is he a real friend or a failed friend ? He hugely disappointed me once... I think I never fully forgave him, but I have really complex friendship principles so he's not the only one to blame. But on the other hand I know that deep inside me I really love him and I know it's the same for him towards me. But there have always been this little something between us that always prevent our friendship to be pure, as it should have been because we really appreciate each other..."
3587,isfp,"My father is one, and one of my best friends is one too. ENFPs are really awesome people in my books. They are so friendly and outgoing but also very compassionate and caring. And you can really have very deep and interesting conversations with them."
3588,isfp,"I‚Äôm not sure if many of you are like this, but I basically think that almost everyone I ever talk to, or so much as see, is completely adorable. It doesn‚Äôt have much to do with physical appearance or something, but I just think there is something so beautiful about people... living. 
I love seeing people‚Äôs faces light up when they talk. Anytime I see someone who‚Äôs visibly nervous when giving a presentation in front of others, I just want to go hug them. Someone tells a good joke or story? Boom. I‚Äôm (completely non-romantically) in love with them instantly. I love seeing people with crooked smiles, or anyone with dimples. I love meeting people who look intimidating, but turn out to be super sweet. People who try to look cool, but are obviously trying tug at my heartstrings. Today, I took some preschool-aged girls I was watching to a public restroom, and I saw this stoic, un-smiling woman hold her hand over the hand-dryer because one of the girls was too short to reach it. Adorable.
Everyone‚Äôs so cute, I swear, although I‚Äôm sure most people don‚Äôt realize I feel this way about them, because I tend to seem kind of serious around people I don‚Äôt know well. But I constantly feel all mushy and happy just observing others, even if they aren‚Äôt doing anything particularly interesting."
3589,isfp,"Oh I feel this. As a woman in a male dominated industry - I am constantly trying to hide how cute I find all of the guys. Some are too short to reach things - some have cute twitches when they are nervous, others are unfathomably handsome and don‚Äôt even know it.  When I worked with women I felt I could openly share my compliments and platonic love for them - but I have to bottle it up with men until I‚Äôve known them for years."
3590,isfp,"first time I read this I sort of missed what you meant, but I agree. I'm a straight(or 95% straight:P) guy and there are a lot of men who are just nice to look at. I don't feel any romantic or sexual attraction to most of them but they're aesthetically pleasing and stuff they do is endearing.
I feel the same way with some women too, just is different since I'm also attracted to them in other ways and sometimes can be hard to separate that"
3591,isfp,"Ooh!! I have the same problem:/. I genuinely like complimenting others, but I‚Äôve definitely had to learn to be careful when complimenting guys because they often think I‚Äôm flirting, especially my friends. I really appreciate when my guy friends are openly affectionate with others, so I don‚Äôt have to worry as much about them thinking I‚Äôm hitting on them lol."
3592,isfp,"Oh yeah, I definitely agree with it being difficult to differentiate part. I‚Äôm a female, and I genuinely don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm straight or bi, because (as I said) I tend to think almost everyone is cute. But when people are especially cute, I have a hard time figuring out if I‚Äôm actually attracted to them, or if I just like them a lot."
3593,isfp,"I am an INFP in a relationship with an ISFP. My question has a few parts. 

If you are struggling with a life crisis, what helps you and what doesn't?

Related: Since ISFPs like to live in the moment, how do you deal with it when the moment sucks and you're suffering? How do you hold on to hope?

What makes you feel close to someone, and what can someone do to get closer to you? 

Related: What is your ""love language""? 
As for my specific situation, I have been dating a guy and I'm very confused because we straddle the line between being intimate and distant with each other. He is going through a hard time. On one hand, I think he shares more with me than he does with most people. On the other hand, I get frustrated that he still seems very closed off. 
I want to help him and shower him in my love but I am afraid of smothering him. I know that when I am struggling, I actually don't really like when people try to help me. I feel like it's my own road to travel. But when I see someone struggling, I spend all my energy trying to help them. Please let me know if you have any insights.  "
3594,isfp,"For me, when I'm having a hard time I like having my wife nearby, she tends to pick up on my cues and will do little things that I normally do, or do something to take a bit of extra care for me. She also asks gentle prodding questions sometimes, backing off for a bit if I'm not ready to talk about whatever it is, with that, I know that she knows and when I'm ready I can talk about whatever it is.  
Those things are really great for me, personally. Hope that helps?"
3595,isfp,"Struggling with a life crisis, I will reserve myself and do research on all of my options. If it is a personal crisis dealing with a life decision I have to make I will take time to think things through and consult people I trust to get their opinion. I grieve quietly but I can always use somebody to lean on; a good friend or SO is nice to have during a hard time. 
When the moment sucks I try to embrace it. Life wouldn't be life without the difficult times too, after all. I like to think of how I am working through the bad times and how much stronger I will be coming out of them.
I feel close to somebody when I can trust them and it's easy to be around them. Although I'm introverted, my close friends and SO don't emotionally drain me near as much as most people do, so I really appreciate that. 
My love language is mostly quality time/physical touch. Words of affirmation is average and gifts are basically null. 
As for your situation, he probably needs to close off to process things. I remember at the beginning of my relationship we had a somewhat serious talk and it took me a solid three days to process what we talked about and how I felt about it. It sounds ridiculous but it really did take that long. I'm a very, very private person and my SO knows the most about me but I haven't come close to revealing every little thing about myself and I don't expect him to either. Give him his space but let him know that you're there if he needs you and I bet he will really appreciate that. My SO is an ISTP and needs even more space than I do so I make sure to give him that space so he is happy. Let me know if you have any clarifying questions :) "
3596,isfp,"This seems very obvious but I find it really insightful. I feel close to someone through deep conversations, long email communications, stuff like that. I think he feels close to me if we are just sitting silently together doing our own things, as long as he can relax and be himself. But I get really fussy and want lots of interaction, which might get in the way of that. I mean, we're both introverts, and I'm fine with silence, but I think I place a much higher value on talking about ideas and stuff where as he would rather we just listen to music, for instance.
This is my instinct as well. "
3597,isfp,"My general proclivity when I'm struggling is to suffer alone. That's what I've always done, and I've come to recognize it as a problem so I'm working on reaching out more to close friends or family for help. As for whether my ISFP boyfriend could support me...good question. It hasn't really been tested yet. We've only been dating a few months.
I don't think my everyday needs are really being met by this relationship let alone if I'd be going through a crisis. But then, very few things cause a crisis for me. I tend to be kind of mellow in the face of hardship and just downplay things. And I tend to not ask for my my needs because they don't seem that big of a deal to me and I usually find a way to just cope independently. 
When I've been with him and expressed that I was stressed or sick, he has comforted me. However -- and this may be a very characteristically INFP criticism -- I rarely get the sense that his ""heart"" is really in it. I think about how to help him basically around the clock, whereas it doesn't feel like he does. As an INFP I think I tend to analyze every interaction and also analyze all the possible interactions I could have with him to try to search for ways I can improve our relationship. 
As an example, the other day I wasn't feeling well when we were together and he comforted me, and I felt so loved and supported. I was having a particularly rough day on my period. Yet, later he just brushed it off saying ""you were just hungry"" and implying that I was blowing things out of proportion. I was really hurt by that. 
As another example, when I was going through a lot of stress at work he would cuddle me when we were together, but he wouldn't reach out to me ever to ask me how I'm doing. When I'm with him he seems to care but when we're apart he basically disappears. Occasionally I will text him saying that this or that thing is happening and I'm feeling down and he will respond with ""aww"" or "":-("".  He's pretty emotionally unavailable. 
Like I said, I prize deep conversation which means I care a lot about whether someone is listening. He will often get up while I'm talking to check his phone. Or a week or two after a conversation he will completely forget what I said, which to me is a sign of poor listening. (I tend to remember everything people tell me because I not only listen, but I go home and replay the conversation in my head so many times.) He is also quick to criticize me for things that aren't really flaws, just areas where we differ. I disagree with his perspective on things, but I strive to understand it. I wish he would want to do the same for me. It's very hard to have a deep conversation with someone who thinks that if they disagree with a point you're making they should just dismiss what you're saying. 
So I know I really feel unsupported in this relationship on the whole. I'm actually hurting a lot. I am sad all the time. But my instinct is always to just reach out more. I want desperately to help and support him and even though it hurts me a lot to not feel the same way back, I love him and it hurts me more to see him suffering and not have my support. It's funny, I feel so lonely now while being in a relationship that I don't think breaking up would hurt me much worse. I know the current state of things is bad for me, but I am trying to be more expressive about my needs and see if it helps. I want to at least work at it. It remains unclear to me how much of what I'm feeling is things about him that I can't change (you can't change how much someone cares about you) and things that I can change (I could be more assertive about asking him to do certain things). I think I have to open up to him about the things that have been hurting me and then see if he makes a greater effort. But I've been holding back from telling him because he is going through so much already and I don't want him to feel guilty about things. "
3598,isfp,"I've recently gotten involved with an amazing ISFP girl! I want to do everything I can to appeal to her ISFP qualities and make her feel really special! What should I be doing and saying? We have amazing chemistry and really like each other but I want to go the extra mile and really understand her. What would you want your partner to say to you as an ISFP? What would you want your partner to do for you? Of course everybody's different but I imagine I could put all your insight to good use! She's probably in this sub too and if she's reading this, then consider this one giant hug! "
3599,isfp,"Coming from an ISFP female...
Be reassuring about your love and affection. Dont go overboard though; she could think you're trying too hard and get weirded out. 
When asking her to do something, don't be pushy especially if it might require her to go outside her comfort zone. Things like ""hey, could you get me a ____"" or other simple favors aren't a problem, but if it's asking her to wear makeup or a certain clothing or something about her personal habits or style, it's could make her feel like you're criticizing her even if you're not. ISFPs don't like being told what to do. Instead, compliment her when she does something you really like, and she'll be more likely to continue doing it because she knows it makes you happy. 
Accept her for who she is. She won't be perfect. She will have her quirks that might not make any sense to you. With time, you will see more and more of what makes her HER because she will bring her barriers down the more comfortable she becomes with you. Accept those weird things about her as they come. With ISFPs, you either get the whole package or none at all. 
When you need to tell her that there's something about her that's really bothering you, be kind and reassuring of your love and affection for her. Let her know why whatever it is bothers you. Be discreet about where and when you tell her-- find a private place away from people. However, don't wait for weeks or months to confront an actual problem. 
Try to take an interest in what interests her, even if you think it's boring. She will really appreciate that you made an effort in learning about what she likes. However, don't fake that you're interested in something she likes, she can tell. If you feel you're really not interested in something she likes, be honest with her. She won't fault you for not liking something. 
Be honest and transparent with her. Ask her stuff, talk to her. If you're not sure how she might want something, ask her show she would like it. ISFPs love good communication, but don't go overboard and don't be clingy. Spend time with her, take her places, do things with her. She will appreciate that more than all the gifts in the world. 
I hope this helps! If you have any specific questions, let me know! "
3600,isfp,"I really like Words of affirmation idk if any other isfp‚Äôs like that but the words have to be meaningful not too appearance based . Cuddle with her while sleeping, give her space when she asks, be kind always & I can‚Äôt really think of anything else "
3601,isfp,"Thank you very much! We‚Äôve been seeing each other about a month or so and we‚Äôre crazy for each other! She really likes me and I really like her! We‚Äôve gotten so close and I can really see those barriers slowly coming down like you mentioned. I tend to gush a lot so I‚Äôll be careful not to come off as too much! Although, in our case we really seem to trust each other and have shared a lot about ourselves "
3602,isfp,"I've done this hundreds of times, and I thought I'd make a thread about it after doing it just now.  It's like ... does this really contribute?  And the guy's post was a day ago, it's not worth bothering."
3603,isfp,"I literally just did this 3 times in a row to a post in r/mbti . I do this fairly often. 
I think it‚Äôs because I feel like what I have to say isn‚Äôt necessary, and because I‚Äôm afraid someone will reply telling me I‚Äôm wrong or something negative. "
3604,isfp,"Honestly, I've probably done that about as much as I've actually replied, lmao. Usually it's either because I suddenly get afraid of how people will react, or because I just get too lazy to actually finish the reply."
3605,isfp,"I do this too often.  Mainly because my ideas don‚Äôt always have the same effect once they‚Äôre on a page.  It‚Äôs not necessarily that they‚Äôre invalid, just different than I wanted.  I try to avoid leaving any bad impressions in life, and that‚Äôs sort of a part of it."
3606,isfp,"thanks for posting - I am currently deciding on what to pursue next because I've been lost for the last year or so on what to do. previously was thinking of doing something in linguistics/foreign language, but I wasn't able to finish college so that fell apart. also thought about personal training but I'm not sure, I like working out and stuff but I'm not sure if it's something I could see myself doing for work.
I feel like I would rather do something with art because it's something I genuinely enjoy. I might try to go back to college and see if getting a bachelor's degree is worth the time or if I could just get some certificates instead. kind of dumb of me to not go for an art related field right away, but I guess I fell for the idea that I'd never make money doing that. truth is I'm not good enough at other stuff to make a career out of it and I also don't care that much about having lots of money, I just want something I can enjoy doing and pays somewhat decently"
3607,isfp,"Probably I‚Äôm the happiest when things are just a little different everyday. I don‚Äôt want to commit to any particular way to be. I want to be able to be a lot of ways. In my mind, I am peacefully assimilating myself to a lot of different situations, flowing easily between them all. Most people don‚Äôt understand there‚Äôs a lot going on inside. It‚Äôs always different, and if it‚Äôs not always different, it‚Äôs no fun.
When I‚Äôm someplace, doing something, I‚Äôm really there. The whole experience is related to that time and place. And people only see the part of me that is with them that day. That‚Äôs who I am for that day, but little do they know that tomorrow I might be different.
I‚Äôm reserved when I first meet people, but I am friendly, warm, and outgoing once I‚Äôve gotten to know someone. I really enjoy listening to people, hearing other people‚Äôs stories and learning about them. I remember a lot of the details. I ask a lot of questions and like the challenge of recognizing where people are coming from and why they might be coming from that perspective. I love the give and take of conversations. I really feel thrilled and excited learning from that intellectual energy combined with that emotional energy. It gives me a sense of the person. In any situation, I love the give and take, the playfulness and energy, the excitement and a little bit of competition, a little bit of one-upsmanship. But when it becomes abrasive and people personally attack others, I‚Äôm offended.
I have a lot of interests and I can get interested in one thing, and then something else comes along and that looks fascinating. I enjoy using the skills that I do have, and they‚Äôre varied. I‚Äôm always on the lookout for something that uses my skills and abilities, that will give me variety and still be stimulating and let me have a mission with people. In my best jobs, I was connecting with people and problem solving and often using tools, adapting equipment or techniques.
My nature is when things get to a crunch, I‚Äôll make something happen that will make it all right. I just know that I can do that and will do that. I love solving people problems.
But part of me shivers if someone tells me their expectations of me, even if they‚Äôre expectations I have for myself. I need the freedom to be able to change my mind or direction. I like to get a feel for what they‚Äôre looking for and then just make it happen and hope they enjoy it. And don‚Äôt ask me how I did it because I have a difficult time communicating that. It‚Äôs whatever moves me at the time. I probably don‚Äôt even remember half of what I‚Äôve done. I can spin around doing nothing and then spend two minutes and get something done. It‚Äôs a whole process that I can‚Äôt communicate, because it‚Äôs not something that can always be written down on paper‚Äîbecause when I‚Äôm doing it, I‚Äôm enjoying it. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a different world. It‚Äôs not a task to me‚Äîit‚Äôs a creative outlet.
I enjoy family and friends. I enjoy being with them and doing things with them‚Äîdeveloping that relationship, bonding with them. I carry through with my commitments and I‚Äôm a very responsible person. Deep friendships are important to me, but not too many. When I am angry I get quiet. Others don‚Äôt know though, that‚Äôs the problem. Because it‚Äôs not an external, visible reaction‚Äîit‚Äôs more passive, turned inward. I‚Äôm trying to think it through to figure a way to get my point across so they understand because I wouldn‚Äôt want to attack somebody. That‚Äôs something about me, that noncommunication, or withdrawal.
I like recognition. It‚Äôs very important to get complimented soon after an accomplishment. If something goes unnoticed or unrewarded, it doesn‚Äôt have the immediate impact that I want. I‚Äôve been learning my own positive self-talk. I tend to be a workaholic at whatever it is I am doing. You might say I‚Äôm a perfectionist. I want people to be impressed with my performance. I don‚Äôt want anyone to be unhappy with my performance so I continue to perform, and that is kind of a driving force. It has been a constant struggle to not overdo it. I need a positive environment to work in and I need the people I‚Äôm working with to support me."
3608,isfp,"Holy hell, yes. It's so hard to effectively communicate when I know I'm angry. I'm typically just not an angry person, but when it happens I usually just completely shut-down, trying to work out the best way to phrase a response without hurting anyone, then by the time I have it, the situation is long over. 
The rest of your post is very accurate as well, this bit just stuck out with me."
3609,isfp,"Not even a little. I am a middle child. I'm closest to my older sister, but even then we never talk. maybe once every few months. My younger brother has a similar personality as I do (almost a mini-me) so we don't have much to talk about either because we just shrug our shoulders at each other and say ""I dunno"""
3610,isfp,"I'm pretty close to my family, but I don't feel tied down to my home town. In fact I live 2000 miles away from all of my immediate family and its fine. I still feel close to them and i still see them for holidays and talk to my parents and grandparents often. My brother and sister in law are even thinking about visiting me. "
3611,isfp,"I always make sure to talk to my family on special occasions such as birthdays, holidays etc. I never forget to send presents or cards, but I think over time this has become a thing I do to compensate for the fact that I don‚Äôt visit often. I moved out of my family home when I went to uni and I never came back. I‚Äôve always wanted to be closer to my family but I have always had an underlying feeling that my family never ‚Äúgot‚Äù me, so I never fully felt myself around them. Now that I‚Äôm living on my own, I get to be myself around people that I feel understand me, so over time I‚Äôve become more distant. "
3612,isfp,"So I've noticed that I tend to be straightforward and blunt about things than many of my xxTx friends. 
For example, I was texting my INTJ friend and I told her she should come swimming with me. She told me how much she dislikes her body and she said ""I just don't think anyone really wants to actually see me in skin tight clothes/ half naked, and honestly I'm fine with that üòÇ"" 
She kept using the üòÇ emoji and became more and more passive aggressive. I tried to comfort her, and let her know that no one else cares about how she looks in a swimsuit besides herself. While I'm aware that she's very self conscious and insecure about her body, I would think an INTJ (who had previously mistyped as an INTP) would be more... straightforward? I wanted to reply in a ""tough love"" sort of way, like ""listen, I know you dislike your body and I know that me saying this isn't going to suddenly make you change your mind, but it's really painful to watch you pass up good opportunities just because of your dislike of your body. Literally no one gives a fuck about how you look, and the sooner you can realize that, the sooner you can be happier with yourself and have a more fulfilling life!"" But I knew if I sent that text, she would get butt hurt and start ignoring me.
I know I didn't give the best example but I've noticed that so many people are just so passive aggressive and aren't ever fully honest or direct. Maybe it's just the influence of my childhood ENTJ best friend, but I'm always blunt about the truth. If they need to realize some truths, I want to be able to tell them without them getting all butthurt. After all, if they were to do the same to me (as my ENTJ friend has done to me before), I wouldn't get butthurt and would appreciate their sincere honesty. Maybe I would even realize a thing or two.
What are your thoughts on the relationship of ISFPs and other types with honesty? Do you think ISFPs have a better ability to both dish it and take it than some other types? Or am I just an asshole? I'm generally a pretty gentle nonconfrontational person, but if I feel strongly about something I'm not afraid to be more harsh and call things out."
3613,isfp,"Yessss, I relate to this. I actually doubted that I was an ISFP for a while because I kept reading about how passive we‚Äôre supposed to be, and while I can‚Äôt really be aggressive or mean easily, I‚Äôm actually very assertive. I see no point in lying or not being straight forward. I think it just adds unnecessary drama and can create problems. 
My brother is an ISTJ and he is not straightforward with others at all. Whenever we got in arguments when we were younger, he would just pretend things didn‚Äôt happen, but I‚Äôd be the one to be like ‚Äúhey, sorry I was being rude‚Äù or whatever, and once I would address a problem he would too. He is not assertive at all though.
I also relate to talking with friends. I kind of struggle because a lot of my friends also will do that whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so ugly!!‚Äù thing, and while I don‚Äôt mind it once in a while, sometimes it‚Äôs like a recurring *thing*. Once, my friend was complaining about how she always ‚Äòlooks like trash‚Äô and I literally said ‚Äúhey, I love you, but you‚Äôre gorgeous, stfu.‚Äù I don‚Äôt like when people hide from problems or lie to avoid consequences or fish for compliments or try to hide their feelings or anything like that. I‚Äôm very, *very* straightforward, and it‚Äôs completely unnatural for me to lie (unfortunately lol).
"
3614,isfp,"Idk mate, this might be due to influences in upbringing etc. I‚Äôm terrible with communication and although I‚Äôm a pretty blunt person, when it comes to being honest with people at the expense of maybe hurting them or trying to get them to change their own mindset I will just avoid it at all costs. Lol "
3615,isfp,"I am also much more straight forward than all of my friends. Except my best friends that is. My best friend is an ENTJ, and we have done pretty much everything together since middle school. He has possibly rubbed off on me a little. I know he has gotten much more considerate of peoples feelings over the years too, so maybe he picked up some of my traits as well.
I don't know what it is, but my other friends will never just give me a straight answer. It drives me bananas sometimes. If you don't want to do something. Just say no. I don't want an excuse. I want an answer. Please don't answer my questions with a story. I don't want an anecdote. I want an answer.
Don't ask me if you look fat in a dress unless you really wanna know. I'm not gonna sugar coat my answer. I wish everyone would do the same. I am not being mean. I'm being honest. Lying to you would be doing you a disservice. Lying is a waste of everyone's time, and only adds pain to the world.
If you are someone I care about, and I see you doing something idiotic. I'm gonna call you an idiot. If you are doing something genius. I'm gonna call you a genius. If you smell bad. I'm gonna tell you that you stink. If you look good in that top. I'm gonna let you know you look fly.
On the flip side. If I am doing something stupid. Please please please. Tell me. I can handle the truth. I'm a big boy now. I would rather be told I'm being a fool than continue being a fool without knowing it. 
I don't care much for being able to dish it and serve it. I just want everyone to be honest with each other. Lying is such a fucking waste of time. All we have is time. Lying would just be robbing each other of the most important resource we have.
‚Äã
You are not being harsh. You are being the friend they need you to be."
3616,isfp,"Eh, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm like your friend, I don‚Äôt like making people feel bad, basically, or I don‚Äôt wanna appear ‚Äúrude‚Äù, so I‚Äôm kind of passive aggressive-ish like this myself.  
üòÖ (‚Äî
(or maybe... I‚Äôm not an isfp???? Nah I‚Äôm def isfp. I just have ~social anxietyyyy~ and hate when people are upset with me.)"
3617,isfp,"INFP here and I think from experience with Intuitive vs Sensing friendships I see how this went down for her- I avoid that behavior like fishing anyway and genuinely do favor bluntness but in a low enough mood it comes out. Personally I know I'd be less prone to that passive aggressiveness with people if they were generally more forthcoming with nice or attentive comments - particularly in recognizing the need to hear these things in that low mood.
It's when you start down that path, of saying something self deprecating and making yourself vulnerable for a moment, and the conversational partner doesn't just fail to indulge in the common social script (""of course you look fine in a bathing suit""), but tries to subvert it or pivot the conversation, perhaps thinking to teach.  This alerts me, as an iNtuitive, that they disapprove of my behavior (itself, a terrible feeling) - whether they're being mean or direct or not, it's that unwillingness to indulge my clear moment of weakness as a friend that makes me feel twice as embarrassed. It becomes a question of why doesn't this person just want to make me feel better. Why don't they realize what their words are doing to me right now. Why did I have to start this conversation in the first place. 
But I can take the tough love if it's part of a compliment sandwich. I value honesty above everything. I just need something like a verbal hug sometimes, to see how much people care, and everything feels alright.
A quick bit to add to your hypothetical tough love example that would work a little better (on me anyway) -""It's painful to see you pass up opportunities because I really love seeing you happy and sharing it with you"" 
‚Äã
Also - I know you said it's not a perfect example but cut your friend some slack. Body issues are complex and deeply ingrained for anyone. Being squirrely about certain extremely sensitive subjects doesn't mean someone doesn't value honesty and bluntness like you do for most other things. We all have a few things that break our typification.   
Anyway, I don't know how you responded to her, maybe you answered in a way that I would have completely agreed with and responded well to. But you described a pattern I've seen in my friendships and I thought an iNtuitive take might help you understand where her behavior came from. "
3618,isfp,"Oh yeah, I relate to this a lot. 
I think it's because I, myself, am willing to go through the consequences/be responsible and it disappoints me when I see others backing off from it."
3619,isfp,"We all hate that.
I might as well be ENTP but I hate/dont know how to break the ice. So, i am ""artificially introverted""(tests reveal INTP but i kinda like people). I can be brutally honest at times. Especially in 1v1 talks. I prefer not to speak in a group setting though, because many people would be upset."
3620,isfp,"Very insightful response! Many of the things you talked about also apply to me, but I definitely needed a reminder! Also yeah, I understand that this isn't just her fishing for compliments. She has actual body image issues, so I just said ""I think you would look great in a swimsuit but if you would rather not come then that's totally understandable""."
3621,isfp,"I absolutely agree! I‚Äôve come to accept that I‚Äôm human, and I make mistakes, so I‚Äôve learned that everything is easier if I just own up to my mistakes. It‚Äôs kind of frustrating though sometimes, because it‚Äôs easy to forget that others don‚Äôt think the same way."
3622,isfp,"I‚Äôm fairly certain that I have Fi, but unsure if it‚Äôs dominant or auxiliary. I wrote a description of myself awhile back that was based on how others saw me, traits I saw in myself, and tried to cover different areas in my life. I got mixed results, a lot of ESFP and INFP. I‚Äôve read about both and I can easily see myself as both, but I know I can only possibly be one, and I‚Äôm stumped trying to find out. 
I‚Äôll make my case for each and try to include my motivations as well.  
My main reasons for INFP are the Fi-Si loop: I‚Äòm sentimental and nostalgic about certain events in my past and love sharing them because I‚Äôm not ready to let them go, and I‚Äôd like to think those around me care as much as I do. I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don‚Äôt want to forget, I believe that they aren‚Äôt truly gone unless you forget about them. I don‚Äôt care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it‚Äôs comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha. I don‚Äôt display a lot of your average Se traits, I‚Äôm pretty clumsy and uncharismatic, and you could see my cringe-worthy and awkward movements from a mile away if you saw me in real life. I‚Äôm not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I‚Äôm pretty un-assertive and I don‚Äôt like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It‚Äôs not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn‚Äôt like being above people, I‚Äôd rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm truly passionate about though, I‚Äôm absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I‚Äôd really ‚Äútake the lead‚Äù that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I‚Äôm passionate about hits. 
My main reasons for ESFP: I feel like I‚Äôm too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I‚Äôve gotten feedback about being very na√Øve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can‚Äôt even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I‚Äôm looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can‚Äôt relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don‚Äôt mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I‚Äôve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I‚Äôve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, ‚Äúyou need to look at the big picture,‚Äù think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it. It looks like a great idea and it looks like the best option at the time, so I‚Äôd go ahead and then it just blows up in my face. 
Based on my evaluation (and if necessary, my profile shows my previous type me posts), what would you reckon I could be?"
3623,isfp,"You come off like an ENFP to me. The reams of text read very NFP and it's almost stereotypical for ENFPs to waver between saying they're INFP or ENFP.
Ne isn't necessarily always about intuiting what will happen in the future or examining your own 'deep' thoughts. In fact I would say it's almost the opposite. Ne is extroverted intuition, which means you might be a big thinker but a lot of the time you're bouncing your ideas off of people around you. In my limited experience Ne users are more interested in talking and being around people to share ideas and hear other people's thoughts, while Se users tend to focus on concrete experiences, which don't necessarily require talking or commenting on the moment.
Ruminating deeply on only internal information ('go[ing] deep into my thoughts') is more of a Ni thing.
The MBTI is more about how you process information and the world around you than about a blueprint for the kind of person you are. I'm an ISFP and I tend to only wear what's comfortable, and I'm extremely clumsy. But compared to my Ne-using friends, I'm much more focused on the 'moment' and more interested in understanding and accepting concrete reality than a multitude of possibilities."
3624,isfp,"INTJ here. So my wife of 9 years took the test in 2009 and got ISFJ, but it was right after we had our first child. I didn't look into it much back then, but recently I have been reading more about the MBTI and the ISFJ doesn't really fit her. Some parts do.
So I asked her to take the test again. She took the one on 16personalities and got ISTP. I'm not a big fan of that site, but it is what it is. 
Now, I think ISTP fits her better then ISFJ, but I really feel that ISFP fits her the best. 
I posted this on the ISTP subreddit and most people thought ISFP as well. 
Here are some notes on my wife and I was wondering if you all could let me know if she sounds ISFP. 

Comes off cold to others but is very sensitive to what I say. Sometimes way to sensitive to my sarcastic jokes. Sometimes she loves my humor, other times she thinks I go to far. 
Often takes what I say and assumes something negative is meant or inferred when I was just stating a fact. 
She sometimes assumes I should know what she is thinking, which usually ends badly.
Is a great and loving mother. She is very free to let the kids follow their own path, as long as they don't spend too much time on the ipad. She is great at homeschooling and develops specific learning plans for each of our sons.
Has days where she is very touchy feely and close and days where she is very distant. I used to wonder if she was mad at me, but now I just give her space.
She does not enjoy abstract concepts as much as I do, such as talks about philosophy, religion, physics, etc.
She likes graphs and numbers to a point. She has always been interested in stock trading and knows tons about market analysis, etc. She studied to be an accountant but never finished her degree. Usually  has some projects going.
She's not really into taking things apart, mechanically. I am the one that does that. I always fix her computer, work on the cars and tractors, plumbing, etc. She loves gardening. She is not really artistic but is great with colors. We recently built a house together and she picked out all the colors and they worked great. Very visual learner. She needs pictures to grasp something.
I could never picture her being a nurse, but I could see her being a teacher. She loves children and seems to have way more patience with them then she does with adults. She also loves animals. 
She only has a few friends and is fine with that.
If she is interested in a subject she will devour anything she can find on it. If she is not interested in anything at the moment, she just watches netflix.
She doesn't appear outwardly empathetic.  
Seems motivated by emotions. She will make a decision based on emotions and intuition, whereas I will make a decision based purely on logic and my plan. She actually can help me in this because if something has to be decided but I can not see the logically correct course, I can get paralyzed, or change my mind too often.
She sucks at planning trips. I always to have to plan our trips, and she is happy that I do. She is happy to just be a long for the ride. This generally works out great and we both have a good time. She prefers I drive everywhere, because again, she just enjoys the ride.
Has complete trust in my ability to plan and figure stuff out. If I get frustrated she just tells me I'll figure it out eventually, which does help, because it reminds me to stay with it. She did follow me half-way across the ocean to peruse my dream because she believed in me. 
She is active in some sports. She grew up on the swimming team. She exercises (Tae Bo) every day. But she doesn't like the riskier sports. I tried to teach her snowboarding, but she was to afraid of the speed. Now that our boys are learning snowboarding, she will go to the mountain with us, but just stays on the bunny hill with skis. 
She thinks personality tests are silly, but she indulges me a bit because I explained they help me. I would ask her to take more tests, but it was like pulling teeth to get her to take just the one.
She loves to read non-fiction and biographies. I read tons of sci-fi and she can't understand why I like it so much. She loves Kung-Fu movies though! She also does like some sci-fi movies (not star wars). We watch movies differently. I tend to analyze them and remember them, but she'll forget she even watched a movie a few months later. It's not that she has a bad memory, I think she just watches movies to relax and be in the moment. 
Procrastinates on some things, but not others. She loves a clean house, but her home office is usually a mess. She has taken huge strides to be more organized. Her digital file system is non-existent, meaning her computer files are all over the place and she has like 1000 unread emails in her inbox with 1000 tabs open in her browser. It drove me a little crazy at first, but now I think its cute and funny. 

I could go on, but I feel like I have gone on to long already. Thanks for your opinions."
3625,isfp,"Also think ISFP, especially- ""If she is interested in a subject she will devour anything she can find on it. If she is not interested in anything at the moment, she just watches netflix."" my Se is so much like this. I go through phases usually lasting 2-3 weeks before finding another obsession. I can't help it. She screams Fi, too.
OP however, sounds like an IxTP. or at least, definitely not a Ni dom, which tend to be very hard to come across as well.
""She actually can help me in this because if something has to be decided but I can not see the logically correct course, I can get paralyzed, or change my mind too often."" Doesn't sound like Ni-Te at all to me, which would probably pick a course and stick to it easily and without budging or needing a lot of outward advice/help; more like high Ne, though Se is possible. And I don't argue that isn't true of her, but I don't get what you mean by her being value-driven makes her help you to make logical decisions.
I know you didn't ask for a typing for yourself but I couldn't resist. Sorry."
3626,isfp,"Heh, no problem trying to get my type, but I am definitely an INTJ, at least everything I read about it matches me. I don't resonate with INTP as I am very action oriented. I'm not an expert, but I relate to this: http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/118054689360/how-to-spot-an-ni-dominant
And when I read stuff like this: http://www.personalityhacker.com/intp-vs-intj/; I see myself in the INTJ description way more then the INTP. 
It is not normal for me to get paralyzed, It can just look like that because I see so many options and none has proven correct to me yet. If I pick a goal I almost always achieve it. But this also makes me more hesitant about picking goals in my older age. 
I didn't mean to say it helped me make a logical decision, it just helps move us forward, whether I think it is logical or not. "
3627,isfp,"I was wondering if any of you guys played Minecraft?  What's it all about for you?
Also, let me know if you'd be interested in playing on my world if I were to host it for a while and see if we can't make it a thing!  I feel like it'd be awesome to have some artsy, creative, like minded individuals such as yourselves to come make it a little less lonely!  Here's a look at some little houses in this village I've been slowly building http://imgur.com/a/ZR9wL"
3628,isfp,"I can run a small server and we can play on yours too if you want to message me, I can get back to you when I'm not at work! I like building forts in survival mode and stuff. But creative can be fun too if you have big projects in mind."
3629,isfp,"I run a personal server with some friends. My interest in the game seems to change week to week.
I usually focus on building a nice living space, but on my server I've actually taken a shine to this cave I built a base in at lava level.
I'd be pretty interested in a server to play on I guess. Not sure how much I'd play on it as I've never played on a public server before.
EDIT: I save before I meant to."
3630,isfp,"Personally I kinda use it like a shield function, I'm pretty good at reading the atmosphere and making sure I don't say the wrong thing, but I only really do that so I don't trigger people, get them turned at me and get screamed at. Outside of that, I heavily empathize with and care for the people I like (although that may be Fi, not Fe)."
3631,isfp,"Fe is the social harmony function. It values what the group wants over the user‚Äôs needs. I use it when I have to take care of people, when I need to be polite, and when I need to put my problems and desires aside for the sake of the group. I also use it to cut away at my individualality to fit in better. 
Also, in regards to empathy, both Fe and Fi are capable, but Fe is definitely more capable because it is about understanding others emotions/it absorbs the emotional atmosphere from the outside (this is why XXTJs are terrible at dealing with others emotions because they have almost zero understanding of emotions that are not their own)."
3632,isfp,"Hello Reddit! Here is the 3rd installation into the MBTI podcast I've been experimenting with! Let me know what you all think and please share some honest feedback on how I can improve this series along with questions that we can explore for future episodes! Thank you all for your support :)

3633,isfp,"I feel like one of the biggest attributes of an ISFP is the artistic side.  I don't think I am artistic at all.  I have taken the test quite a few times and every time I come out ISFP.  Also, if there is no one else taking the leadership role I will often ""Assert"" myself into the position. I was just wondering if anyone else is missing some big characteristics. "
3634,isfp,"You don't have to be artistic. I find just having artistic values is an important aspect of an ISFP. And I too don't mind taking leadership roles if need be, I just tend not too. The tests are more of guidelines anyway."
3635,isfp,"One of the biggest attributes of the INTJ personality is their ability to be masterminds. 
The extent of my masterminding abilities is deciding on whether or not I'm going to watch Die Hard or Aliens and whether I'm going to be drinking Coke, Pepsi, or green tea. 
Look, you are you. You are not your MBTI type. Are there some similarities? Yes. But you must remember that ISFP is just a title that describes certain human behaviors. You are an individual; are you really going to fit perfectly into a cookie cutter system? Probably not. "
3636,isfp,"I too am not artistic, I can't draw for shit. I've found that if you try to make yourself fit into the stereotypes you're just going to drive yourself crazy. MBTI is better used as a tool for insight into different ways people think. It's more like we all share the ISFP approach to life, rather than we all are the description of an ISFP person."
3637,isfp,"I like to be ""artsy"", but i'm not that artistic besides the occasional latte art at work. But I too am an ISFP and also do not take leadership roles unless no one else will or I feel that everyone else is incompetent. "
3638,isfp,"So I almost totally forgot to do this. I'm a night owl so I never really know what day it is, the whole day changing after midnight thing never made sense to me. 
Aaaannnyways, share your art stuff in this thread, it's mandatory. ^^I'm ^^just ^^kidding, ^^it's ^^actually ^^not
And yes, writers can get in on this. So can painters, poets, photographers... Basically if you made it you can post it."
3639,isfp,"This is as far as I got with that work in progress I posted last week.
http://imgur.com/vidJfTr.png
I keep feeling bad about kind of ripping off someone else's art style so I can't finish it!  but still I hate letting my works go to waste, even if they aren't finished.. (which they never are ;p)"
3640,isfp,"In a growing close friendship, naturally one would want to be more open and personal and get past the surface, superficial, more formal friendship, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me or ISFPs as a generality, the thought of sharing anything that really matters is so deeply scary that I don‚Äôt know if it will ever happen."
3641,isfp,"Normal for me. Transition yourself slowly and it gets easier. You can share little things and you‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs not as hard or scary as you thought, and people will most respond positively to that connection. That‚Äôll make it easier when it comes to being ok with sharing big things."
3642,isfp,"i think its just because we think no one will like the things we like, or they will be weird towards us just because we like something too enthusiastically
just go for it and you'll know who your true friends are, no one needs fake friends whom you cant be yourself around"
3643,isfp,"Awww. I love you for this. My husband is an ISFP and after 3 years I'm still learning new things about the guy. He enjoys when I ask him questions and ""fish it out"" of him - which is dandy cuz ENFPs love a good emotional scavenger hunt."
3644,isfp,"I have an ISFP friend and I also have some social anxiety, and so I tend to say things like ""sorry for being annoying"" routinely... do you think that you would interpret insecurities of this kind as a lack of trust? I trust her a lot, and I don't want her to think it's her fault that I'm worried about annoying her... it's a completely irrational fear and she has told me time and time again that I'm not annoying... but of course I can't ask her if the constant apologies are annoying because that would imply that I didn't trust her... I'm worried that she might translate my insecurity into me not trusting her..."
3645,isfp,"I cant speak for everyone here but personally I would just feel bad for my friend if they constantly apologies since surely they've gone through some trauma before to make them that way.
I probably wont do anything to change them or criticize though since its not my place to turn them into a different person. 
However I feel being together with someone out if pity is really a shitty thing to do and wont end well for both sides. So if the other person feel bad for you,  you'll probably just stay as their friends. 
Anyways Im sure you've heard before that confidence is attractive, if you want to be with the person you may want to present yourself differently.  "
3646,isfp,"I had a friend like that. Never did it occur to me as a lack of trust. Anyways, how did your parents react to any kind of self-expression from your side? That might be worth digging into if you'd like to resolve it."
3647,isfp,"No. Im a young adult ISTP so kinda in my WTF years at this time... I should also point out that I really like her and it's the first time in my life that I've felt this way, and I have no idea what to do with those emotions... in a way I guess falling in love is my trauma... because it's painful "
3648,isfp,"I get that you're in love and all that, but someone gave you this belief that you behavior is wrong and should be apologized for. Being in love merely supercharges those misconceptions, it doesn't create them. Being nervous around your crush is normal, being sorry for your very being is not. Also, saying sorry once in a while is perfectly healthy, but you say you're routinely doing it despite being told you have no reason to feel sorry. You also mention social anxiety. Fe inf or not, those are very strong indicators of unresolved trauma (which can be emotional, verbal and/or physical in nature, acute or chronic). The thing with trauma, especially the ones involving our parents, are usually so marinated in denial and minimization that it's hard to realize it's actually is trauma. It's so common you wouldn't imagine.
I cannot tell whether you have unresolved trauma or not, but the indicators are definitely there and it would be unwise to remain closed to the idea, even if you're not convinced. I hope I'm not pushing too hard on you, but I kinda wish that someone would have told me these things when I was younger. Anyways, I hope you manage to hook up with that girl of yours. Good luck, mate."
3649,isfp,"I don't believe my behavior is wrong, so much as I'm worried that it might be annoying. As far as I'm concerned wrong and annoying are two very different things. You see I've never really known a girl besides my sisters. because I was kind of sheltered, so I'm just not sure what I should do. I don't think I've done anything wrong, it's just for the first time in my life I actually give a damn what someone else thinks. lol I probably made it sound worse than it is. I'm not sorry for my very being, I'm wondering if I might act weird because I definitely act different around her."
3650,isfp,"Thanks for sharing! I really like how they put these words together so neatly and succintly. I need like, a phone wallpaper of this or something so I can see this everyday as a motivational reminder to myself."
3651,isfp,"Hahaha I set it as my phone wallpaper yesterday as soon as I found it!!! And it looks awful because it's not a legit background image, but it got me set aside Pokemon Sun and start my job application :)  I've hated my job for a long time and I'm finally mustering the guts to do something about it!! I don't want to lose this momentum!!"
3652,isfp,"Sometimes I get bored and feel like i'm in this closing monotonous rut, so I try to change aspects of my life. One way I've noticed that I do this is by rearranging my room so it feels like a new space. I'll move all the furniture around, rearrange clothes, actually deep clean my room and everything.
Anyone else do something similar to this? I'm sure this isn't isfp restrictive, just trying to get discussion going."
3653,isfp,"All the time.
I generally hate change, but I think that's only when it's out of my control/not my choice.
But every few months I feel like I'm in a rut and want to change EVERYTHING. I usually don't... I generally only change a few things then it's ""good enough."""
3654,isfp,"Yep!!! It usually happens when I get settled into a routine for way too long to the point that I feel stuck. I'd get the urge to change my name, move to Bora Bora and start a new life as a hobo lol. For me a break in the routine usually fixes the issue--go out with friends and get hammered, sign up for a backpacking or hiking trip, drive to a new town near me that I haven't visited in a while, things like that."
3655,isfp,"Every eighteen months I have to change something. Location, major in college, job, relationship, hobby (this is more like every 18 days lol)
It must be a Te thing. It's not that I'm necessarily bored or unhappy, but like clockwork every year and a half I feel deeply dissatisfied and self conscious and need a big change in one area to keep the rest of my life going. "
3656,isfp,"All. The. Time. I love change. It is one of the most refreshing things in my opinion. I love rearranging, redecorating, moving, all of it. 
I also really like that my husband is military. So every few years is a clean slate."
3657,isfp,"I do know the feeling you're talking about, where it seems like everything is mundane. Usually what I end up doing then is changing what I do in my free time pretty drastically. I frequently go from months of holing up in my apartment and binging on some shows/video games to months of playing lots of basketball and going to parties.
I think I've come to start doing this because it also suits being introverted. I can hole up when I'm drained, and when I start feeling the need to socialize again I can do that. "
3658,isfp,"Based on my opinion- 
Tom Holland in The Impossible and Spider-Man Homecoming.
John Travolta in Phenomenon.
Jessica Alba in Into The Blue. 
John Francis Daley in Freak & Geeks.
Any other good films/shows out there with isfp‚Äôs? They all seem to carry this theme of authenticity that just resonates strongly with me"
3659,isfp,Virgil from The Abyss. A very strong Fi dom leader and protagonist. I highly recommend the extended director's edition because it has much better character development that was cut out in the theatrical version.
3660,isfp,"I can name two istjs mistyped as isfps
- rey, star wars - istj mistyped as isfp
- ichigo, bleach - istj mistyped as isfp
Bottomline, mbti type in fiction is dumb.  Has no bearing on anything what so ever.  It‚Äôs not real and we try to identify with characters that are well written and likable no matter what type we are.  Be the best person you can be, not a fictional character"
3661,isfp,"Speaking of ISFP authors I also think Rick Riordan (who wrote the Percy Jackson books) is ISFP and he has included more and more LGBT content as he was writing his books, showing adaptation in his values and respect toward his readers for more inclusive content! He also writes colorful characters and stories inspired by mythology (a good use of Se Ni imo) if you like reading books ;) (it is a fantasy series for kids but it makes one brighter I recommend it)"
3662,isfp,What do those characters even have to do with this topic? I don‚Äôt type fictional characters. I predict the the mbti of the actual actors who play them. That would be silly to predict natural human behavior of a fictional character. Maybe I could‚Äôve reworded the title better
3663,isfp,He comes off as ESFPish for sure. I‚Äôve seen him in a lot of his movies and I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs an introvert. The biggest differences I‚Äôve seen are that ISFPs seem to be more kind and less opinionated than extroverted. Just my experience 
3664,isfp,"Ok well to be more specific to the topic I think Spidey is either an esfp or an enfp.  For an actual real life isfp, I‚Äôd say Ryan Gosling.  His character in Nice Guys and La La Land also strike me as an isfp.  I‚Äôm not usually one to type fictional characters though lol"
3665,isfp,"Yeah Ryan gosling is %100 XSFP. Honestly feel like these online articles that type celebrities are almost always off. But a lot of the ISFPs seem right on. I can even see it in their natural facial features sometimes. Always darting their eyes and shifting their eyebrows.
I think people say ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù is infp cause that‚Äôs what I would type Toby Maguire. I‚Äôve noticed mbti is all in the person who performs the act, not in the act itself. Almost like saying someone has blonde hair when their natural color is brown. Actors are groomed and trained to take on these roles that can polarize their true personality traits"
3666,isfp,"His Fi is very clear but he is very action-oriented and I think as introverts we would not be constantly as impulsive as he is. And we tend to rely on our tertiary function as a bad habit... Doubling our introverted ways or extraverted ways for extroverts. I haven't seen any sign of Ni ter in Eren (like you can see in Simon from Gurren Lagann for exemple - at times he tends toward passivity, defeatism and a lack of faith in his own capacities... He has a very good character development though) But I also haven't read SNK entirely so maybe you have better proofs than I do of his introverted ways ?"
3667,isfp,"Yeah a lot of the celebrity isfp typings seem pretty accurate!  Zac Efron is another dude I think is probably an isfp lol.  
I think tobey macguire‚Äôs spider man might have been an isfp, been a while since I‚Äôve seen the movie"
3668,isfp,"I wonder where you have read up to. He seems more introverted in the manga and gets less and less impulsive as the manga progresses to the point where he has a stoic and unexpressive demanor. But before that development I saw him as an ambivert at best, some people said the anime made him a little more extroverted than he was in the manga. Even then I thought he  was quite reflective and introspective despite his impulsiveness. There was also parts of the manga where he had his self confidence crushed because he thinks he relies on his titan power too much. He was also capable of surpressing his impulsive anger and attempt to fool Reiner and Bertolt. Recently he is very capable of using Ni to come up with long and detailed plans, fool his enemies and come up with insightful ways to defeat them (Idk if that's Ni but correct me if it isnt). Theres this joke on the snk sub that his IQ is now 300 because of the insightful and complicated plans he made. "
3669,isfp,"My ISFP husband is trying to heal a moral wound. I'm not sure he'd be comfortable with me posting the details here. However, it involved making a life-changing relationship decision together, which Dear Hubby (DH) later came to regret/resent me for, and then used as a long-term justification for cheating on me. That infidelity stopped about 12 months ago, but for DH the pain and guilt hasn't passed. For the most part, DH carries this all as a silent pain, but I feel a lot of empathy for him, and quietly carry the pain alongside him. He struggles to discuss it with his therapist, even though he actively wants to work on it with them.
Looking back, he can see better decisions he could have made to be less hurtful to the people he loves. While I think he could have made better choices, I've forgiven him for what he did. There is still a solid friendship between us, including moments of deep love and a sense of respect. If I have a frustration, it is only that this moral wound holds him back from rebuilding with me. If I have a fear, it is that DH will officially decide he isn't worthy of his own forgiveness. I'm not sure what he'll become, if that's the case...
Have you ever inflicted yourself or an important relationship with a moral wound? How did you find your way out of the darkness?"
3670,isfp,"ISFPs don‚Äôt tend to hold grudges. If I resent someone who isn‚Äôt actively causing a problem (or refusing to fix one) it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve decided they can‚Äôt be trusted in some regard. Since ISFPs typically defer to their partner‚Äôs judgement when doing...well, almost anything...he might blame you for the decision you guys made together? Perhaps in his mind, he trusted you to make the important decision and you chose poorly. 
Another likely situation is that you remind him of the trauma and even though he loves you, he is fighting the urge to ‚Äúcut and run‚Äù so he doesn‚Äôt have to deal with it anymore. Out of sight, out of mind.
Neither of these situations is fair toward you but you are dealing with a special kind of logic, one pretty much designed to protect his feelings. You‚Äôd be surprised what he could justify if he hurts enough. Maybe not though, since you mentioned he cheated :/"
3671,isfp,"He did blame me for the decision we made together, for a long time. He kept his blame inside for about two and a half years, during which he was cheating on me. He didn't bring it up until after I discovered the cheating and confronted him about it. At the time, he had totally convinced himself that I forced him into the decision, and I had to bring out journals, the recollection of our couple's therapist, and other resources to prove otherwise. Over the past year or so, we've had multiple conversations breaking down first the idea that I forced the decision, and then break down the idea that it wasn't the right thing to do... 
(I THINK) He has finally moved past this issue, but now he is confronting the moral wound of having behaved helplessly and hurt me and our marriage over something he had control over/partial responsibility for. This is the moral wound: He's basically decided HE'S the one that can't be trusted not to hurt ME, and has spent about two months trying to force my hand on rejecting him. But, I keep telling him that I love him, I keep asking for opportunities to make right any part of the damage that I may have caused, and I keep offering opportunities for him to make right any of the damage he may have caused. I don't reject him, and I don't want to divorce him...
He seems happy when he is with me, but seems afraid of this happiness. I don't understand this. If you're happy, just feel happy? If you're not, then don't? I might not be able to help him see his way out of this, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask others with similar dispositions how they reconciled. "
3672,isfp,"Punishing himself. He doesn‚Äôt believe he deserves to be happy. You‚Äôre refusing to hate him so he‚Äôs gonna push you way until you do.
Then he can wallow in the misery he thinks he deserves."
3673,isfp,"Yeah, in a way, that's the ultimatum I gave him. 
I've told him that I don't want a divorce, but I'm not going to fight him on it, either. I won't be the one to organize things, find the professionals, make the appointments, etc. But, I won't not show up or not sign papers, if he really wants to end things. He hasn't made any moves towards divorce, so far, and is still doing things like inviting me out for breakfast or helping me with projects.
He's moving out into his own apartment on the 20th. Physical space between us means he must actively seek me out or invite me over, if he wants me around him. This also means I get more space to figure out some of my own stuff. 
I'm not sure I better understand how to help him overcome this intense self-loathing, but at least this conversation generally confirms that I'm not misunderstanding his inner world."
3674,isfp,"As positive as Fi has been to me intrapersonally, lately I feel like it's an overwhelming force and I wish I could turn it off for a while, see things more objectively, not have to filter everything I hear and read through ""how does this relate to me/how can I relate to this"".  It gets exhausting and exasperating and I think it's a large part of why I don't say much in real life unless I've really thought it through to a point beyond Fi.  
Not really looking for advice, just thoughts. üôè"
3675,isfp,"I think about the consequences of my neglect and disinterest.I am extremely adept at this because I always imagine the worse possible thing that can happen thus propelling myself into deep fear and paranoia. There comes my motivation.
Though externatilies also motivate me well enough."
3676,isfp,"Hello intj here I am going around and talking to all of the subreddit mbti people and asking about what goes on inside their brain and what their types is all about. Things like how do you process information? How do you deal with people? Things like that. I am an intj, in case you want to know. Feel free to ask me whatever. This is my first perceiving type so I am interest to hear how that works. Yeah I know it is not an easy question and I am not very specific but let's hear it and if need be I will ask for an expansion."
3677,isfp,"Generally much more quickly than other types. The joke is that SPs absorb information and respond with an action so quickly that there doesn't seem to be much processing going on.
I personally will tend to open my information intake more when things don't make sense rather than trying to analyze them more deeply. At least, that's my habit.
In measured doses after being alone for long periods, besides that, I think I'm typical in ISFPs for just letting my feelings/emotions guide interactions, doing what feels right at the time."
3678,isfp,"Oh a fun one let's do it. I process information by simply gathering as much of it as possible and seeing how it all fits in to the big picture. I am a very top down thinker I see the big picture and then use information to refine the big picture. When I am presented with a problem I gather as much information as possible and the just let it sit and when I need it my intuition steps up and I solve a problem and then most of the time I have no idea how I solved it until much later when I have time to think about it and uncover all of the connections that my brain automatically made. Dealing with people is kind of a tough one I usually try to not, I am insanely introverted just about as introverted as a person can get really. When I have to talk to people I sit back and let them talk as much as possible and then get the big picture and let them give me the details to refine what the big picture. What drives me is knowing things and then being able to apply them to something I don't want information just for the sake of having information I need to know how to apply it. I have a plan for everything even when I don't, when I ""wing it"" I am coming up with a plan. When something goes bad my mind has a thousand thoughts trying to figure out what happened and it doesn't stop until I have an answer. Well that is pretty much all that I can think of right now anything else feel free to ask. "
3679,isfp,"It's really difficult for me to have any kind of plan. I've tried many different things, but I always end up neglecting them and coming back to them weeks or months later and sometimes finding I've already done them, sometimes not. I heard it explained that the difference between judgers and perceivers is that judgers need external control for internal freedom, whereas perceivers need internal control for external freedom.
But one thing I was wondering about judger types, do you enjoy idle socializing? To me it seems that there kind of needs to be a purpose to the conversation and then they will open up, but perceivers enjoy idle chit-chat."
3680,isfp,"I don't know about all j types but intjs absolutely abhor idle chit chat if you are talking to us we want you to be direct and have something to say, if what you say isn't interesting I believe that most people would probably find me rude because I will terminate the conversation and walk away. From my experience with you said true I hate small talk and anything like it I want to jump into a deep conversation right off the bat and start throwing ideas around."
3681,isfp,"I've always related to the emo subculture and music, listening to bands like MCR and The Used. I feel like the ISFP traits seem to be similar to some emo traits. Emo being Emotional Hardcore, they are generally introverted, sensitive, and emotionally driven. This doesn't mean you dye your hair and wear eye liner, I don't, but I still consider myself emo."
3682,isfp,I've never been emo nor felt emo. If anything I've been called hipster/artsy but I don't see that either. I don't identify with any group really lol. I just like what I like and if it happens to be popular/country/hipster/anything so be it!
3683,isfp,"I went through an emo faze and even today kind of still identify with it. But like you said, I don‚Äôt wear the make up or the clothes, but the music like MCR I listen to, Muse is quite a big one for me as well. "
3684,isfp,"r/shittymbti x)
But in all seriousness, yes, ISFPs present a lot of traits related to the emo culture like self-depreciative thoughts/feelings, wanting to be special, artsy traits or an inclination to art, wanting to relate to others but not popular people (I think), etc.
Please downvote if you think I'm not right"
3685,isfp,"i mean i love punk and MCR (especially Three Cheers era) is the shit for me.
that album made me an emotional wreck and i still haven‚Äôt recovered from it.
anyway, i never understood why this stereotype existed? maybe it‚Äôs because of Fi and Se working together for self-expression and aesthetics?"
3686,isfp,"I grew up listening to ""emo"" music but I have never gone through the whole died hair, stripped arm warmers, teased hair, and obsession with all things Tim Burton. 
Although his shit is good I just didn't feel the need to draw Jack and Sally everywhere."
3687,isfp,"Same. I wouldn't say i truly fit with either description, but if i had to pick, id also say ""hipster/artsy"". Certainly not emo. 
I've noticed a lot of isfps are also into things like anime, which is great, but i'm not in the slightest. 
Exactly. I absolutely have certain interests and preferred genres, but it also changes. And isn't part of any real group. Though i am very open minded and i love the fact we all have our own interests.
‚Äã"
3688,isfp,"Not really, no. What about them made you think they were amazing? I usually don't get that feeling based purely off of physical attraction. 
I'll think ""Oh, wow that person is really attractive."" but that's as far as that goes.
I don't think i've gotten a this could be ""the one"" feeling from anyone."
3689,isfp,"I may admire them or have a crush on them, but I wouldn't think they are ""the one"". I have higher expectations for somebody to be ""the one"". Well, a lot of expectations than just seeing them walk around."
3690,isfp,"Hahaha, I thought I was the only one! This happens to me on a daily basis! And oddly enough, it's always directed towards ordinary-looking girls... not supermodels, or anything like that... just normal-looking girls that I, for whatever reason, find absolutely breathtaking! Despite being a shy guy, I always feel this strong urge to run up to one of those girls and tell her just how stunningly beautiful she is, but if I ever did, I would most certainly end up finding myself lost for words... How do you even go about describing such peculiar beauty? Personally, I've never been all that good at verbally conveying such things... xD"
3691,isfp,"What did You feel? 
I heard a story from a celebrity (forgot who she is) that her father at that time saw her mother walking somewhere and thought that she's the one and then she approached her and then they're happily married until now. "
3692,isfp,"I felt like ""I could see spending all my life with them"" it was a very strong feeling though
I don't know what prompted it, because I only saw them walking around, (not to be shallow) but I didn't see their personality in action so I could only base my idea of them off their looks. but the thing is (again not to be pretentious or condescending) they didn't look like a supermodel, they looked normal but I thought they looked ""beautifully normal"" if that makes sense"
3693,isfp,"Mine would be a dog walker. Walking dogs in beautiful scenic areas with no cars, sidewalks or roads. Just nature.
Or a dishwasher at a restaurant that only a few people go to. I would listen to music and zone off while washing dishes. 
Or a motel receptionist at a motel that only a few people go to. I would play my PSP for the whole shift. And listen to music."

3697,isfp,"My ISFP has not yet presented me to his parents, but on rare occasions when the conversation goes into that direction he thinks they would like me (INFJ).I found out that his mother likes a particular location (where I have already been, and loved it) and bought a book for her, about this place. The ISFP knows it and while he does not encourage me to send it to her (via post), he lets me do what I want. The way he put it is if I want to show him the note that I want to write as a dedication to his mother, it is only after I have already posted it and there is nothing he could change about it. Does he just like living on the edge or he would actually know his mother to know that he is well and happy with someone but not through him? What do you guys think?"
3698,isfp,"Backfiring and doing more damage than good is in the same ballpark isn't it? It's not an either or situation. I wouldn't send a present to someone I have not met. That's your call though.
Do you feel insecure about the level of commitment and longevity from your ISFP partner? Because it's not something you'll get an answer about without speaking to them. We can only speculate. I would never introduce my parents to someone I'm dating unless I'm serious about them, but it also takes me a long time to decide if I am serious about a partner.  I would just ask him to think about whether or not they're serious and if so why haven't we met their parents yet. "
3699,isfp,"It is in the same ballpark indeed:)
Lately he is a lot more expressive in his level of commitment, how he wants us to meet his parents etc. So he does not make me insecure, quite the opposite. Even when there may be a shadow of doubt, he atuned himself to my thoughts to the point of predicting what I could misunderstand (even if i dont) and clarifies it straighforwardly. Our daily interactions, conversations seem to never be enough and he is constantly seeking for me, sometimes almost stalking (we joke about it, but he confirmed it). He always seems to be knowing my whereabouts, asking what im doing, if I had lunch etc. So I would say he is in it wholeheartedly. We have not met the parents yet because he does not want to do it via skype, but personally. They are expecting to have their visas issued for a few months now and the idea is for them to have it within another couple of months. Based on that, if you were me, would you still send the gift? btw, thank you for the feedback. "
3700,isfp,"I seem to have had this issue my whole life. I guess my willingness to listen and be a fucking doormat/toy for people to toss around has left me in a vulnerable position. I try, really hard, to ‚Äúbe myself‚Äù and SCREAM my opinions but when it comes down to it I am just a really go with the flow kind of person.
The issue is that I keep attracting people who take advantage of my pushover-ness and fall into these horrible friendships where I am not happy. It sometimes seems as if all the relationships are like this so I doubt myself because the common factor is me.
I guess i‚Äôm wondering if there is a common thread in this community. As un-researched as the Myers briggs may be, this is the one community I‚Äôve found that I can actually relate to nearly every post. I was wondering if any of you, who are probably older than me, can relate to this problem and have some sort of solution, because I am sick and tired of this pattern I‚Äôve fallen into and I don‚Äôt know how to escape."
3701,isfp,"I have been that way for most of my life, people have told me Im too nice, one of the best things Ive ever done was get fed up with the world around me and just started outright saying ""no"" to people when I they think Im just going to drop everything or change my plans because suddenly they decided they want something from me. its very freeing once you realize how easy it is. people just dont understand how much we want to be left alone and at some point you have to start hinting at it."
3702,isfp,"I used to be, but it's really about developing boundaries and enforcing them. I went through a lot of experiences and really did learn people will treat you how you allow them to. Now I have zero problem telling a person no or cutting them off if needed. I am still prone to giving them enough rope to hang themselves though"
3703,isfp,"Unfortunately I'm a total doormat too, but I don't recall being manipulated much in my life. It's not nice being in that position, yet I've always been aware of it happening to me. I think maybe it might be more to do with self-esteem than being an ISFP."
3704,isfp,I am a feeler too. Yes we are susceptible of being taken advantage of because we care and can be used. Being an introverted feeler I think sometimes you might need some quiet time to evaluate the friendships every so often. Then you can better see the knife coming. Also think about what are your absolute boundaries and communicate then. This may take time and effort since you are so ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù :) things get easier
3705,isfp,"The temptation might be to make excuses for people/see the best in them/give them one more chance, etc etc...
Allow yourself to get angry with them! People are taking advantage of your kindness and that's low. Bad enough to treat anyone like this, much less their own friends. 
Sometimes people are just shit. But sometimes people just need to see how their actions affect others to learn to do better. In either case, a good tongue-lashing will do them good."
3706,isfp,"Something that's not necessarily nice is learning to be an asshole to others on moderation. Context is key. 
And as some saying goes "" being nice to others means being a dick to yourself "" or some such shit"
3707,isfp,"ISFP's learn this hard and fast in their teen years imho. I went through a good eight years of just living as a doormat and it was mostly 'cause I was in a bad place and didn't have the energy to enjoy being me. When it's showing that you're weak like that people can't seem to help taking advantage of it (& surprisingly a lot of the time conscious of it). When YOU decide not to be a doormat, that is when you stop being a doormat...
You get to:
- Choose who you spend time with/ how much time you spend with someone (that took me the longest to learn)
- Let people know what you want/don't want to do
- Talk about your own issues when people open up about their's
- And if someone unloads without listening to your side of life, then you're allowed to let them know what's up.
I dunno I got so sick of people who hardly knew about me calling me meek or a pushover. I had to develop some tough skin, and to start doing what I wanted to do - which sometimes meant sacrificing relationships I was obsessed over. Ask what are YOU getting out of relationships. R you happy with that?"
3708,isfp,I always hear about ENFPs obsessing over INTJs or INFPs obsessing over ENTJs. Is there an ISFP equivalent? Is there a type that really likes us or are we kind of always in the background/left out? Who would you say is attracted to ISFP naturally?
3709,isfp,"INTJ here, and girlfriend is an ISFP. We're in heaven, we talk all the time, the affection both emotionally and physically is like a dream come true. She not only picks up on my emotions, she draws them out of me effortlessly. When we're out together around social situations we both turn into extroverts from the comfort of each other being close. 
Best part is we both get it when the other needs some ""me"" time, and needs to veg. There's no competition for time."
3710,isfp,"INTP spouse of an ISFP.  We are best friends and always seem to be happier than our other committed peers (stories of fighting, disagreements, etc).  Not that we don't fight, we just hate doing it because we'd rather be joking around together and just want to get the fight over with to go back to having fun.  We tend to balance each other out in the best ways without thinking the other person is crazy for thinking the opposite about something.  Really goes to show that so much of relationships come down to respect not just being on the same page."
3711,isfp,"I know an ISTP who loves ISFPs. I like ISTPs too but think they can come off as douchey sometimes if you don't know them very well. I've noticed ESFPs are really drawn to me, which sucks because I do not like them at all. I think ISFJs like us because we're both pretty chill. I don't know of any other type really ""obsessing"" over us though."
3712,isfp,I also am dating an intj. I'm a guy isfp she's the intj and we are like peas and carrots. We can talk about anything constructively and with great fun. I dig the outlandish and far thinking that the intj is and she can also separate her emotions easier. That comes with a down side since I base my reality on what I'm feeling and she absolutely doesn't. Although we compliment each other very well. 
3713,isfp,"Yet another INTJ dropping in that has an ISFP girlfriend. Where as the ENFP-INTJ relationship seems to be some sort of anomaly and built mostly out of novelty, I feel like the ISFP-INTJ relationship has larger grounds in actual growth and stability in the long run, assuming both people are self-aware and willfully developing. The key here is maturity. We complement each other in a lot of ways to make a very strong pairing. I imagine for a lot of us, we're the pairing we don't realize we've always wanted until you try it. You just add some much needed sensitivity and prodding for adventure to our lives. "
3714,isfp,"I find that introverted feeling guys have crushes on me, but only if I act like my goofy, weird, somewhat domineering self around them. A lot of them are intuitive too surprisingly. I think they were infx, infp (2?), isfp (?). One enfp took an interest in me but I kind of brushed him off (he has crazy ex that is enfp or infj I think). I'm still not that interested in him romantically (he probably isn't either because it was long ago) but I really wish I got to know him better. He was really interesting! All the extroverted guys I like didn't even notice me until I gave out signs that I liked them, and I think they eventually liked me back (estp and enfp(?))"
3715,isfp,"Guys who have liked/crushed on me (at least, ones whose types I know): INTP, xSTJ, ExTP, ExFJ. There are some extroverts at work that act like they're into me, but that could be because introverts are less likely to approach and initiate conversation. 
A lot of xNTJs online say they love us, but given how prevalent the intuitive bias is, I have no idea how true that is.
ENFPs seem to like us too."
3716,isfp,"That sounds wonderful. I've dated an intj and have an intj friend and felt super self conscious around them, it's been awkward and comforting with them the same time. Interesting you've had a different experience. "
3717,isfp,Super fascinating. Maybe I just don't understand INTJs well enough or have just known ones not interested enough xD I find them quite selfish and hard to understand. Maybe they are immature..but I don't  sense that from them.
3718,isfp,"Mmm like any type, they come in different nuanced forms, perhaps that turbulent-assertive thing has some validity. There are certainly many arrogant, stubborn INTJs that are convinced they've no need for love and on the flipside there are certainly legitimate INTJs that are very insecure and could do with a caring soul to touch their lives. And then everything in between. Unfortunately, people have the most experience with the former often, I'm sorry if that goes for you as well. I get sick of my fellow INTJs as well. =P 
But yes, the most difficult thing is mutual understanding. We need to figure that out from the get go, and it takes work, otherwise communication might be the only barrier between an otherwise high-potential relationship. "
3719,isfp,"Hm, I don't think this INTJ fits into either in this case. He is very hot and cold and ignores messages and then comes back months later. It's odd and I've made peace with it, but I'm sure I'm not of importance to him. That's why I never considered INTJ as someone who would be attracted to ISFP - there's just too much different. "
3720,isfp,"In your relationships, romantic or otherwise, do you feel it is better to be needed or wanted?
Personally I feel that I could make myself useful in most situations and so I particularly like the feeling of being wanted because my thoughts reach the point of people not always wanting the things they need. "
3721,isfp,"This question digs very deep.
Romantically, the ""wanting"" will evolve to ""needing"", and I believe this is very normal in serious relationships. You start to date someone and keep seeing them, because you want to get to know them; it is a choice you are making. Later, you learn to need them to an extend....in a way that you don't need anyone else for whatever it is that they do for you. If you need help or support, that person is there and should be the first person you go to.
If someone wanted to date you because they just need your financial support or whatever it maybe, it may be because they feel like they have no choice left but to settle. That's just my thoughts!"
3722,isfp,"In familial love, I think it's natural to feel both love out of necessity and love out of genuine interest for your close family and friends. Most people start to realize that they genuinely just want to be around their parents because they love them for who they are at some point, but when they're young, unemployed, and a student, however, there will also be a bit of a codependent sort of love. I'm at the stage of my life where I feel a mix of both companionate and codependent love for my parents as a college student, who's unemployed. I'm growing out of the codependent stage of love for them, and it's been turning more so into companionate love as I've gotten older, but I also have to acknowledge that I do still need them to do what I want in my own life and to pay for things. 
However, I don't think that you should have codependent love for your close family your whole life. You gradually grow out of it, and these days that's usually finally over around the age of 25-30 for most people. Ultimately, you should just feel companionate love for your family when you find independence and stability in your life. 
In romantic relationships, however, codependent love, love out of necessity, would be the LAST thing that I would want, and it's usually majorly unhealthy. I would much rather be loved and wanted for just being who I am in a romantic relationship with another person than being loved because I'm needed, or being someone's whole reason to survive and get up in the morning. I  would not want to be like my lover's mom, and treat them like my baby, who they can't live without. That's a sign of an unhealthy codependent relationship, and that's not what true romantic love is. 
True romantic love is loving someone, simply for just being themselves, and knowing that, though it might greatly upset you to let them go, you'd be able to do it, if they asked you, and you'd be able to ultimately move on with your life and survive without them in it. But if a romantic partner seriously loves their partner because they ""need them"" and ""can't survive without them,"" then it's more like taking care of child than being in love. It's not healthy. "
3723,isfp,"I'm a little late this discussion but I have to say that it's better to feel wanted. I don't want to be kept around out of necessity, to fulfill someone else's arbitrary needs...I want to be kept around because someone genuinely enjoys being with me, and continually chooses to do so. Not to mention that being ""needed"" can be such a burden sometimes."
3724,isfp,"In my relationships I feel its better to be wanted. But at the same time I don't hold it against anyone or demmand from anyone that they have to ""want"" me. If Im close with someone and we drift apart or their life becomes busier or they get a boyfriend, I dont hold it against them or make them feel like shit. 
I cant stand it when friends in the past have gotten super pissed just because we started growing apart. Just because we dont hang out as much or talk as much doesnt mean I dont care all of a sudden. Its just how life works."
3725,isfp,"Man I'm sorry, I know how frustrating it could be. Ultimately you can only help the ones willing to help themselves. Despite trying to help others it's their life, you can only hope they see what your doing for them but realize it's not your life to live and their path is their own...Good luck."
3726,isfp,"I understand your point, the evolution of a relationship can lead to a ""I need you in my life"" mentality of be careful of the codependency it'll breed. I tend to lose myself in relationships typically because i give so much of myself to the other and the thought evolves into ""does this person want me here or do they feel stuck because of how much I made myself useful?"" "
3727,isfp,"Very insightful! I agree with your point of someone should be the entire world of another. I'm a romantic, and I would love for this to be healthy. How perfect would it be if all you needed was another. This type of thinking puts a lot of pressure on the relationship. It doesn't allow for another to grow. 
Familial love is a tricky one. Everyone wants to belong and in a sense a community is needed for that. Often times I find myself believing that once you're  mature enough to choose properly, friends become a family of choice. Of course your not ""stuck"" with them but that's whay makes makes the ""want"" so much stronger. 
Anyways thanks for the input!"
3728,isfp,"I think it's interesting that most people here are answering 'wanted'. Not unusual though, I used to only just want to be wanted (ha!), but I think I was afraid of getting to close, like you mentioned: lose myself in a relationship. So that's pretty normal to have those thoughts....I've been there. I think for me, ever since I allowed myself to feel that way (giving my all to the point where ""I need them in my life""), I can feel the my SO is feeling same way; this is the best I've felt, and I know this is cliche to say, but sometimes you just know when the feeling is mutual in that aspect. Many people are so afraid of being codependent, but that's not what it is and it doesn't always become that way. You just still have to understand yourself and grow with the other person; you guys should be like a team. "
3729,isfp,"I agree, in relationships you either grow apart or grow together. Don't chase or follow don't stand behind me, be next to me when we face whatever it is that comes our way. Codependency isn't necessarily bad. What if it's something we moderate? How does codependency get handled by other personality types?"
3730,isfp,"Now, I‚Äôm aware none of us like compliments really. They‚Äôre awkward and we never really believe them anyway lmao. But, what is the one compliment that really gets you? 
I just got told I‚Äôm really good at helping people who are down, and I would make a great therapist. Boy - that was music to my ears!
I also think it‚Äôs interesting, as the compliments I like are the ones which go directly with who I am. Not ‚Äúoh your hair looks nice‚Äù. But again, the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really making me feel better!‚Äù when that is actively what I try and enjoy doing. Interested to hear yours! "
3731,isfp,"Asked my boss for a raise last year. He said I was the best damn worker he has ever had, and he would have to hire three people to replace me. I went from working 8 dollars an hour to 12. The gesture made the compliment a lot more touching."
3732,isfp,"The best compliment I've received (and I still remember it to this day which says a lot because my memory sucks lol) was by one of my class mates in high school. 
He was one of my friends in 9th grade and out of no where he told me that I'm such a sincerely nice person and that I reminded him of Leigh Ann(sandra bullocks character) from the blindside.
I had never seen the movie so after this comment I decided to watch it. Knowing someone thought that highly of me and saw me as that amazingly nice was awesome."
3733,isfp,"someone once said I was absolute physical perfection. I have a lot of body image issues so it's something I think about every once in a while when I'm not feeling great 
Also a coworker once said I was a unicorn, and when I asked her what she meant she said I was unique. Not really sure what she meant by that either, but it is the most interesting compliment I've gotten"
3734,isfp,"I just recently discovered the beautiful world that is ASMR videos thanks to a friend of mine. For those of you who don't know, the ASMR is that feeling you get when somebody whispers in your ear really closely or taps on glass or something. It's like a tingly feeling that feels fantastic. I had no idea what it was called for the longest time until my friend brought it up, which lead me to do some research on it and eventually finding entire YouTube Channels dedicated to making it.
Since then I've found myself listening to these videos before bed as a way to wind down. This Video by AccidentallyGraceful has been my favorite so far. It makes me feel incredibly relaxed and helps me sink right to sleep within minutes. 
Does anyone else watch these? I've heard it doesn't work for everyone. Make sure to wear headphones if you're going to try it; they make the videos that much better."
3735,isfp,"I just can't get enough of the whispering into individual ears. I have a really good pair of headphones (only the best sounding music for my ears!) so it works perfectly on me. Though, now I'm interested in the more ""natural"" ones. What's your favorite?"
3736,isfp,"Hello, beautiful ISFPs. I ask this question, because, according to my personal history, I have been hopelessly attracted to ISFPs (despite all the failed attempts). Please feel free to say anything. Stereotypes, criticisms, experiences, personal thoughts; everything is welcome! Have an awesome day."
3737,isfp,"I can only comment on a few people so I really hope that my current views will change as I meet more. Thus far, I have found them to be some of the most annoying people I have met in my entire life (not specifically the males).  Intense and overbearing are the two words I would use to describe them. Basically it got to points with all of them where I just wanted to avoid them. And now whenever I meet someone with the same energy as them, I shudder."
3738,isfp,"I haven't met any male INFJs in real life yet but my sister identifies herself as an INFJ so if it's okay with You I'll share my thoughts about her. My sister is an intelligent, understanding, responsible, and a hardworking doctor. She's an eloquent and a creative writer as well. She dances gracefully which I'm kind of jealous (haha) because I have two left feet. She's always ready to lend an ear, a shoulder to cry and to lean on, and being the positive one when things are going tough. 
Sometimes she becomes bossy but I don't know if that is an INFJ trait/stereotype but maybe the reason is because of birth order. She is the eldest and I'm the middle child.
Have an awesome day as well!"
3739,isfp,Usually it's in the stare. And their minds move really fast with lots of things to talk about. Usually faster than their mouths can keep up. I should have really mentioned in my last post that they were all super nice.

3742,isfp,"So, I have an ISFP friend of a friend. We used to be in the same social group that went rock climbing together, but after that group dissolved, we lost touch. She randomly messaged me on Facebook today after 2 years of silence. After a few exchanges, she invited me to ride with her to go rock climbing on a whim. I thought it was going to be a group thing like it usually was, but it was just the two of us. I was surprised. 
Without the group dynamic, I found it much easier to talk to her. I do much better in 1v1 conversations and it was a fun, relaxed time. She mentioned briefly that she didn't have a boyfriend, but I'm not sure if it was a social queue or if she was just stating it because it was a relevant to the conversation at the time. I didn't really read too much into it when she said it, but I'm wondering about it now.
I never really considered her as date-able in the past because 1) she had a boyfriend at the time and 2) I think she is way out of my league i.e. she is more attractive and has her life pretty well together. Our day together has made me consider it, though. I had a lot of fun hanging out with her. I made a few stupid jokes and she laughed at them. This never really happens with me. When she dropped me off at my place, I thanked her for the invite and told her I had a really good time. She said she was really glad and mentioned that she wasn't really doing much schedule wise and to tell her if I wanted to hang out again. 
So now in typical INFP fashion, I'm kinda crushing on her now because a girl is giving me positive attention for once. She might just see me as a good friend, she might not. I have no idea. The next time we hang out, I really want to just ask her outright if she thinks she would be into dating me. My prudent side is telling me to just chill and be her friend for now. If things are meant to progress, they will naturally progress. But I'm impatient. I want to know now. 
What do you all think I should do? "
3743,isfp,IF YOU DON'T ASK HER OUT I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL ASK HER OUT FOR YOU
3744,isfp,There's no need to ask her what she thinks of you. A move like that can imply a lack of confidence on your part. Just ask her to hang out and plan something for you two! She's practically given you the green light. 
3745,isfp,"Admittedly the battery is one I was slightly unsure on including, but I thought it could represent an introverts tendency to slow down and conserve energy - especially when paired with, well, being an introvert. Just as the thought bubble shows the way we consider what we say quite thoroughly before hand - and in general. All in all I was going for something which incorporates our personality preferences.
Introversion - the section at the bottom, with pictures related to this preference.
Sensing - the 5 sections of the heart at the top, one for each sense, with appropriate pictures coming out (also making it extraverted sensing).
Feeling - the whole heart, relating to how we tend to follow our ‚Äúheart over our head‚Äù.
Perceiving - the open book at the bottom, as I believe we are pretty open minded, relaxed people generally.
Anyway thankyou for the question, I appreciate it! :)"
3746,isfp,"u/thechessgoddess and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!
If we count moral obligations out of the equation, 
Question 1: How is murder logically fine?
Question 2: How is murder logically wrong?
NOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded. This is a place to express yourself, after all. "
3747,isfp,"one, because morals have no objective basis in reality. you don't usually kill people because it feels wrong, but if you'd be better off with them dead and are only thinking rationally, there's no issue
other than two, which is that there are typically very harsh punishments for murderers. it's a pretty dumb question though, there's a lot more to discuss about the moral aspects of killing another person"
3748,isfp,"I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion? Thank you!"
3749,isfp,"The best way would to drop a clear hint that you‚Äôre interested, preferably a statement. Then just wait and see how we respond. If we‚Äôre interested we‚Äôll reciprocate, if not we‚Äôll make it obvious with our actions."
3750,isfp,"Be straight up. I hate having to rack my brain into figuring out whether you like me as a friend or not. I'm also kinda dense to hints so make it easier for both of us and be direct as possible.
Edit: You posted the question twice and I read some answers from the previous thread that I want to add. While I do like directness, it's better if it progressed naturally over a mutual hobby, say yoga class or something. We have to be friends or at least acquaintances or else I find it a bit strange."

I think I would be compatible with J types (most of my friends are Js), but I also joke that I‚Äôm going to be single forever. Finding people interested in me usually isn‚Äôt a problem, but finding people I like / am interested in back is the challenging part. Maybe I‚Äôm looking in the wrong places? 
Although, to be fair, I‚Äôm not actively ‚Äúlooking‚Äù either. 
(P.S. Yes, I know every person of every type is different, so there‚Äôs no correct answer, just looking for discussion.)"
3754,isfp,"Undetermined. I‚Äôm married to an ISTP and I love him. We have had a roller coaster of a marriage and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs supposed to be like that.
I didn‚Äôt exactly experience a healthy home environment growing up so I don‚Äôt really know if  I‚Äôd recognize compatibility if I saw it fr. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I also have a history of sabotaging every romantic relationship I‚Äôve ever had, true story."
3755,isfp,"I could never see myself romantically with an ENFP. They are too easily bored / distracted that they would switch the conversation to a different topic before we can reach a conclusion in the first topic. I'd like to drill down more than explore (Ni) and an ENFP would tire me quickly
It also might be because I'm afraid they would get bored of me and move on to explore a newer relationship. I'm not very interesting (a bit routine) when it comes right down to it."
3756,isfp,"I have dated pretty much all the types at some point. üò©üòÇ
The longest ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù I‚Äôve had was an on-again/off-again thing with an ENTJ. We met when we were fourteen and were immediately an item.  We continued to stay close in some capacity (dating, friendly, and in between) for the next twenty something years until we were both married to other people. 
I was married to an INTJ for awhile. Like the ENTJ it could have lasted and was very stable if I hadn‚Äôt picked apart minutiae to overanalyze and deem imperfect.
Close runners up as far as long term boyfriends over the years were ENFJ, ESTP, and another ISFP...all between one and two year relationships.
I found the ENFJ‚Äôs extroverted feeling  made him seem emotionally manipulative, ‚Äúweak‚Äù, and way too social for my tastes. He was kind and supportive though. We broke up because he had to move away for medical school and I didn‚Äôt want to go with him or have a long distance relationship.
The ESTP thing kinda fizzled out. The ISFP shared too many of my own problems to maintain my interest.
My ISTP husband is supportive and extremely loyal and hardworking. He is very invested in me and our kids and selfless in his attempts to be a good husband and father. He is also a lot of fun. Cons are that he has an explosive temper and Fe-outbursts driven by feelings of resentment and being under appreciated. He also led a pretty hedonistic lifestyle before I came along (drinking, gambling, smoking, etc.) and seems to miss that sometimes. Likely blames me for ‚Äúreigning him in‚Äù. He lies about things he thinks aren‚Äôt a big deal and I can‚Äôt fully trust him for that reason. We also experience major problems with communication."
3757,isfp,My friend is isfb and I don't know how to help him. She always says that she can't recognize her own feelings. And often she says that she doesn't feels loved and is not good enough to be in a relationship. I don't know why does she feels this way? She is loved by many people and she doesn't have major depression. How can I help her recognize her feelings better in a healthy way? And make her feel loved? She knows that I love her and her parents and other friends but she still feels this way and I'm worried and sad that she feels this way.
3758,isfp,"As much as you may want to, you can't fix her. I don't know if this is all isfp's, but I have to deal with my feelings and emotions on my own terms. No one can do that for me, and no one can force me to do so. I have to want to. Sometimes I process by journaling, or talking to myself or screaming in my car or by talking to someone I love and trust and getting everything out in the open until it all makes sense. I like to bottle things in for a while until the pressure gets to be too much and I just explode. Releasing the pressure so that it's not all so internal and up in my head helps a great deal.
But basically, just be there for her. If you want to help her, show her that you're there and you're not going to leave. Sometimes there are no right words or actions. Sometimes the best thing and the only thing you can do is to be there and to be present. As simple as that seems, it helps, at least for me it does."
3759,isfp,How do you know she doesn‚Äôt have depression? I‚Äôm not saying she does but only a qualified professional can make that claim. I have the same thoughts but I have depression and have been emotionally abused and neglected my family for most of my life. I see a therapist every week which helps but I also had to recognize what was happening and want to get help and then find it on my own. If she does want help you might be able to help her see a therapist by offering to drive her there or something but she has to want it too. 
3760,isfp,"Yep. Hate it. Sometimes I don't even feel embarassed, but when talking about a naughty subject close to people who I'm not too familiar with will often get this result. I honestly don't know why our bodies betray us this wayyy"
3761,isfp,"Hello fellow ISFPs!
I recently noticed, that I have hard time grasping my memories. Well it's not like I'm forgetful or something. But sometimes I have problem remembering if that particular day I was driving my car or walking to shop. I remember all important stuff. I'm not forgetting how to do my job, but I can not distinguish weeks from months. I can't remember if something happened this year or last one or maybe 3 years ago. Is it my brain just filtering or should I check myself?"
3762,isfp,"Recently I was discussing this with some friends and discovered that my memory is quite a bit better than average. I have friends who can't remember ANYTHING from their childhood and it's a completely foriegn concept to me.
Social interactions stick in my memory the best -  I can remember down to the details of what each person said in conversations even as long as a year ago.
Alternatively, I don't remember facts or dates well."
3763,isfp,"I'm sort of the opposite as I can remember things people did back over 10 years plus. Today I was talking with a friend and noticed something about her personality and thought of something she did 15 years ago that was in line with her personality today. I think it does surprise people though. I think having a good memory makes me prone to dwell on the past.
However, I am not that great at remembering stuff that happens in movies or people's names. "
3764,isfp,"My ex-gf who was INTJ had crazy memory. She was pointing me something out that was like 4-5 years back...
But my ability to forget everything still concerns me. Well I like it because every day I feel full of understanding and forgiveness, but worries me that some day I will forget something important..."
3765,isfp,"I'm the same way about interactions.  I think it's because I usually think about all the interactions I have with people for a few minutes after they've happened and they become ingrained in my head.  Most of the things I do are on total auto-pilot, though, so I don't seem to record a lot of the things I do on a day-to-day basis. "
3766,isfp,"I feel like Isfp‚Äôs are literally the missing link in what makes me a better person. Whenever I find myself in their company, I notice that I am much more comfortable being quiet and in solitude. But to an extent, it makes me feel down and alone. 
I notice that I can think through things much better, but it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm isolated from everyone else in the world. Do y‚Äôall get this feeling? What‚Äôs it like being an introverted Fi/Se user?"
3767,isfp,It is a matter of we are very in tune with our feelings and internalize a lot. For me I've meet only one person that makes feel like a true extrovert and I draw engery being around her. We listen and observe mostly. Depending on the person we are not very judging by our nature. We listen and speak with compassion and honesty that's why you feel. Comfortable 
3768,isfp,"Functionally, ISFPs have PoLR Ne; so essentially, they are kind of disconnected from everyone else in the world. (It doesn't sound as bad to us as it probably does to everyone else. Think of some nature lover living in a hut in the middle of a forest. I personally thought of Aurora. (Also disclaimer, ISFPs are various and for some PoLR Ne might manifest differently than it does for others)) Plus the Si demonstrative offers a lot of comfort in everyday living, despite having adventurous Se in there too. When you're alone and in solitude you can indulge in your individualistic ideas and imagination easier than when you're around others (speaking for myself, at least). I can do simple errands and not get bored, as long as they are done relatively fast or there's not too much to do. I prefer there to freedom while doing stuff/not be overly systematic or organized."
3769,isfp,"I actually do get restless when alone for long periods of time. I used to spend a lot of time alone before, but I decided to change that and now I always try to have people around me. It makes me feel better having others (people I like) around me. Sometimes I do need a break from everyone, but only if I‚Äôm overwhelmed or need to clear my head."
3770,isfp,"I suppose being introverted helps when it comes to being alone. Although I don't see this topic as a Myers-Briggs issue...all humans should learn to live and be completely comfortable in their own company. I think it's extremely healthy to be able to do so. I also think it has nothing to do with the amusement of these ""personality types"". I think most people who take the Myers-Briggs get too wrapped up in them. They are not really scientifically accurate so being comfortable by ones self is just a human trait, not solely for any ""personality type"". I am an isfp when it comes to the test but I'm not that simple. Lol. None of us are. We all share traits, no one is so ridged and clean cut to just act within a single, non scientific ""personality trait"". Just my two cents. "
3771,isfp,"For me, learning that I'm an ISFP was just something I did out of curiosity and boredom. Since then, I have learned a little more about the type, but it hasn't had any impact in the way I perceive things or what I do. 
I know other people use the Myers‚ÄìBriggs Type Indicator to help them with career or relationship advice. What about you? Has learning that you were an ISFP helped you in any part of your life and if it has, how has it helped you?"
3772,isfp,"For me, it's helped me understand that people see things differently and their point of view is not inherently wrong, just different. Before, I wondered why anybody would do X or think Y or think like Z, but now I know it's just that they have a different lens that they peer out into the world with (even if it's not necessarily mbti related and some other phenomena completely)."
3773,isfp,"it gave me understanding that I'm just not the quiet guy and other people aren't just talkative,  some people are different and think and do differently and do so because of their personality. I do x, y, and z and someone else might do a, c , and f"
3774,isfp,"It's helped me to understand the reason I do certain things or the way I think about things. For example, ISFP usually have a hard time grasping abstract concepts...which is something I've always struggled with. Though I don't know the strict neurological cause of this, knowing things about ISFP has helped me to get a general idea. Its also helped me know what I want as far as communication goes. I remember reading about ISFPs and how we communicate and thinking ""This is so me...but I've never been able to articulate this thought"" or ""I've never thought of this...but it totally fits."" I send that kind of stuff to my SO (who loves this kind of thing) and I think overall its really helped our relationship because she understand how I recharge and how I communicate and vice versa.
It has also helped to categorically identify things I'm good at and things I need to work on. By default, I'm mega critical of myself and so its hard to see the good things about me. The stuff I've read points out a lot of general pros to being ISFP, and while not all fit to a tee, enough fit that I am able to recognize that I am good at something."
3775,isfp,"I just learned what type I am and I think it has helped me to understand a lot about myself. 
Before I was kind of insecure about the depth of my relationships w/ friends mostly. I had a lot of trouble accepting that I am a quiet person w/ not a lot to say. And I thought because of that, that people didn't connect with me in a valuable way. Learning about how other types view ISFPs has really helped me to be more secure about those friendships. 
It has also helped show me where my natural box is and to guide me on how to step out of it. Stepping out of your box just a little bit helps show others and yourself that you can try new things. 
Idk its a little scatterbrained but an insight on my short journey."
3776,isfp,"Let me preface this by saying that I didn't know my MBTI-type until recently, and I didn't really care all that much and I still don't, but there have been one or two small revelations. My university recently made the results from our selection tests public, and apart from some formal maths stuff, intelligence and logic tests they apparently also ran a MBTI test, and apparently I'm ISFP, which explains a couple of things or habits that my friends have been pointing out for quite some time now ‚Äì¬†for example the fact that I love to find ""beautiful things"" everywhere I go. Whether we're in the woods or walking through the city I'll often go ""Hey, doesn't that look really nice?"" ‚Äì¬†well, I guess that explains why I tend to see those things more than other people.
More to the point though, music is my life. I have been making music since I was six years old and I listen to everything, but mainly I think Progressive Rock is the best thing in the world. Now, two years ago some friends got me into trying weed and one thing I quickly noticed is that music gets EVEN BETTER. I mean, movies and other forms of art as well, but music is something different when I'm high. I have been told by other people that music is pretty relaxing when they're stoned, but I don't think anyone I know ever ""feels"" the music like I do. Does anyone here have similar experiences?"
3777,isfp,I feel the same as you do about music and stuff. I listen all the time and write and play music. Its weed that doesnt sit right with me. Any time ive gotten high i have a terrible time and one time when i listened to music and it made it sound lifeless and empty and terrible. It was really quite a bad time. Plus it caused me a week of psychosis after i stupidly ate an edible one time knowing that weed doesnt sit right with me. Anyway I stay away from the stuff.
3778,isfp,"Yess!!! Hell yess, music when high takes me to another level completely. Stretches out time as well, like a 4 minute song feels like a lifetime and I can feel the layers of music. I listen to Indie a lot. Bands like The XX."
3779,isfp,"One thing I noticed is that weed really makes me get hung up on certain parts of songs. Like I'll notice something I never noticed before and have to repeat the section 2 or 3 more times. In a way it makes it harder for me to sit back and enjoy the music, but it will also make me appreciate the artists a lot more for the creative and subtle stances they take in the writing process. "
3780,isfp,"It's almost like I give off a different first impression to new people. They seem to think I am more popular and light than I actually am. Once they learn that I'm more serious, moody, and not a fucking socialite - they bounce. 
Are your first impressions usually off? It's pretty annoying because I'm attracting the wrong people and not meeting anyone similar to me."
3781,isfp,"I haven‚Äôt had that issue, in a very chill person in general. Through high school I was known but not popular and mostly stuck to a core group of friends. I graduated almost 10 years ago and I‚Äôm still friends with a few of them, one is still my best friend and was even my best man at my wedding."
3782,isfp,"Yes, people often get very wrong first impressions of me, and I noticed that some people just can‚Äôt let go of those impressions and they get confused when I act in a way that is not in the little box they made to try and put me in. Maybe they see me as undermining their system they use to understand people and too much work to deal with. So as I meet new people I try to emphasize early that it is not easy to understand me."
3783,isfp,"Not sure. In my current school (well, I sort of already graduated but I'll call it my current school) the first friend I got kinda turned on me after a while, ignoring me and acting like a douche if he has to interact with me. I'm certain it's the fault of someone else, though, since some guy who didn't like me from day one started hanging out with him shortly before this happened. They're still big friends.
I do find that in general people are a little more iffy about me after I talk a lot about my views, since some can be a bit controversial. But I guess they usually just forget it after a while since it never turns south."
3784,isfp,"I do find this to be true, strangely... but at the same time, it can be the catalyst for unexpected friendships, when certain people prefer our more serious and emotional interiors over the ""socialite"" exterior we for some reason tend to have around new people.
I've tried to be more relaxed and myself when meeting people, and it really does make a difference because it turns off the wrong people (who would've been turned off anyway once you stop acting popular and fake or whatnot) and gets more like-minded people in your circle."
3785,isfp,Anybody notice that Angela on BB20 is an ISFP? Her business involves making/selling artistic stuff on etsy. She's a former elite gymnast and pole vaulter (athletic). She said she has huge walls/boulders against developing romantic relationships and that whoever can get past them deserves a lot of credit and she hadn't had a boyfriend for years before BB20 (in spite of being beautiful).  
3786,isfp,"I mean they could be an ISFP. Or they could be an ENFJ or ISTP. Lots of types are athletic, lots do arts and crafts, and lots of types are single and attractive. Many ISFPs have these traits, but not all. "
3787,isfp,"I'm particularly interested in knowing your personal opinions because I want to enlarge my data storage about Fi-doms. I will give you some help: How does Se manifest itself in you and not in Ne users? What do you see that the INFPs have that you don't?
‚Äã
I'm probably going to be asking this question in r/INFP too, so stay tuned."
3788,isfp,"I'm good with directions. (Have an internal map and compass).
I notice changes in my surroundings (such as on common routes I take).
I'm pretty good at Where's Waldo.
I rarely think about the past or future, and when I do I have to force myself and I get more tired.
‚Äã
‚Äã"
3789,isfp,"Honestly? I have no idea
Edit - that‚Äôs a terrible answer. I just feel as if I‚Äôve always resonated with ISFP and I‚Äôm happy that way. I went through the types at first, and when I got to ISFP, I just knew. But I will absolutely question whether I could be INFP sometimes. I‚Äôm 95% sure I‚Äôm ISFP, but who knows. I might have to do a bit more research to be sure now! 
I feel like I‚Äôve always been a sensor tho. Yeah of course I can be intuitive - but I‚Äôve always lived in the present and enjoyed it that way. I‚Äôm actually pretty bad when it comes to the future; I can stress and overthink. So I usually just stay in the present. I‚Äôm happy that way. 
But Fi is certainly my dominant function. Se is a close second. I‚Äôve always got that on cognitive function tests, and even with my own research I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what I am. I‚Äôll read into it a bit more - I‚Äôll be sure to let you know if I find out otherwise!"
3790,isfp,"Definitely more down to earth. Maybe a little more practical and less dramatic. I love my INFP friends, and enjoy their conversations and insights. Sometimes they seem quick to turn things that happen into a dramatic emotional narrative when it's unnecessary, kind of like romanticizing? I dunno. Also I'm not as a creative of a writer."
3791,isfp,"Reading the other comments makes me feel like an INFP, lol. Being an autistic ISFP is a pretty weird experience, I guess.
Anyways, Ne is just horrible for me. I make quick assumptions about things without considering alternatives unless someone else points them out, I don't really go off tangents, and I prefer a good end result over an original idea that's not executed that well."
3792,isfp,"It's the Se. One thing I think that makes us different, is that INFPs are more likely to be 'mellow', in their heads-kind of people, while ISFPs are more likely to be direct and forceful. I watched a couple of STPs talk about Se in a youtube video, and they mentioned how they can feel 'a power surge' going through their body. I do tend to feel that 'power surge' at times myself, and it's very enjoyable. Se is supposedly about physical force/power. 
Other thing, and I don't know how accurate this is, but I tend to enjoy EDM. Of course MBTI doesn't necessarily indicate music taste, but I doubt there would be many INxPs who would find it enjoyable. They don't seem that kind of type to me."
3793,isfp,"I think infps are more slow moving in every aspect.
Se manifest itself in that things have to happen right now. Soo it makes you energic, impatient and efficient at ahchiving goals quick. 
No waiting and pondering other possibilities (Ni doesn't see that many options).
And my Ne blindspot is too real. Mix that with weak Ti and you have a resepi for making mistakes."
3794,isfp,"Mostly the way I learn, I can pay attention to what my teacher's saying, looking attentively at them, taking notes, but ask me and my mind will fly away, but I'm doodling, loking to other side, browsing memes, and I can say what's going on in the class, recapitulate what we are talking about, and maybe share a barely related but still related anecdote. that, and the fact that im very stubborn with an idea. "
3795,isfp,"Mostly by knowing so many INFPs. I feel very, very similar to them in terms of how I react to things and what is important to me but much more practical, levelheaded and in touch with reality. I‚Äôm better with directions, more aware of my surroundings, more concerned with my appearance and more hedonistic (lol) than most of my INFP friends. I also have way less of an aptitude for poetry and stories than they do (although I do enjoy those things). 
But I think the biggest difference actually manifests in our senses of humor, at least in my experience. INFPs are more likely to make puns or use reference humor in some way, whereas I‚Äôm much more inclined to use physical comedy in some way. "
3796,isfp,"I find your comment very interesting and I would like to ask you something more about what you said:
‚Äã
I'd like to know more about the hedonism thing. Could you give some examples about the differences about hedonism in you and in your INFP friends?
‚Äã
like quoting movie jokes or funny sentences from series or things like that? 
‚Äã
I wonder what it mean =)  If it's not too much trouble, could you give me an example? "
3797,isfp,"I often think about what can I do right now for the future, but the only time I ever really think about the future itself is near the end of a trip, driving in a car, or sitting in a train for a while, looking at the scenery pass by, and with no one talking."
3798,isfp,"ISFPs I've met in real life are a lot more graceful, fashionable, and physically oriented. I envy that. Massively. You have no idea. They also tend to put more effort into their looks and are more physically appealing. 
I'm all talk and no action most of the time. I'm also horribly unfashionable."
3799,isfp,"I'm much more likely to do something because it feels good than my INFP friends. Like sleeping in, eating certain foods, doing certain activities. My INFP friends are not nearly as pleasure seeking as I am lol. 
Yes, things like that as well as bringing up inside jokes or memes or something like that. 
Sure. I act very clumsy because I think it's funny and it makes the people around me laugh, or I'll make silly facial expressions or something like that. Physical humor is using your body and your surroundings in a humorous way (as opposed to using your words). "
3800,isfp,"I see your point. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm any of that, but I appreciate it! 
And honestly? INFPs are really appealing to me. Believe it or not, you have a brilliant art sense that I adore. I have an INFP friend who just painted a beautiful picture; I‚Äôm genuinely interested in buying and hanging it up! I also have a twin who‚Äôs INFP - her artistic abilities far outweigh mine!
Even your sub is absolutely stunning. Sunsets and lovely colours everywhere. Your style may not seem as appealing to the general world, but I personally have a great interest in it and your fantastic individual style. Let‚Äôs not forget your brilliant way with words! I‚Äôll still be blown away by some of your ability to write in perfect metaphors and deeper meanings. You all have such brilliant energy around you."
3801,isfp,"‚Äã
do you think so? I thought ISFPs write very well metaphors too. "
3802,isfp,"Of course! I don‚Äôt particularly read all that much, but there‚Äôs a reason so many brilliant writers are INFP! You absolutely have great metaphors and understanding of things on a deeper level. I appreciate you think we‚Äôre good also, but you certainly take the cake on that one!"
3803,isfp,"My theory is that ISFPs prefer to arrive to their 'tastes' than be influenced into liking them. But I can't find any good reason for the same. 
Eg. I've noticed that I reject shows for being mainstream, and not because I necessarily dislike the content of the show. Your thoughts? "
3804,isfp,"Generally, I dislike mainstream media (tv shows, music etc.) because they are generally hyped up and lack any real substance. Though if I do enjoy something, e.g. a song, then I will like it regardless of its popularity.
On the flip side, songs especially remind me of certain times or stages in life, of people and emotions. So from time to time I won't listen to a certain song because it reminds me of someone/something I don't want to think about. As a defence mechanism, I've been trying to prevent this by finding more and more music on my own that isn't as popular and not sharing it with friends - this way it's ""my music"" and I can listen to it no matter what. 
Edit: I do not like Star Wars. I'm convinced that most people who grew up watching those films are semantically/emotionally attached to them - they're nostalgic. On the other hand, I did not watch these films but since the release of the latest film, I've watched 3 of the earlier films and I just can't get my head round them. I want to like it but I just can't. I don't have the same nostalgia for them as most people seem to, so I wouldn't say I like the Star Wars films (for example) to fit in with popular opinion, as a previous commenter said. "
3805,isfp,"A lot of mainstream stuff have their place in the pop culture actually because they've earned that spot with quality content.
And then there is stuff that is just being pumped out just for the sake of pumping out money.
I like, what i like :P"
3806,isfp,"i sometimes find i have to watch a popular show a few times before i really get into it. i don't know.. i kind of assume that because something is popular, it's generic and pretty unoriginal? (which, in all fairness it sometimes is) just... authors use the same techniques over and over because it's a product for the masses: what works doesn't need fixed ~~(it does tho)~~. "
3807,isfp,"Thanks for the ramble! And you're right, if it aligns with our passions/ likes I don't think the 'hype' about it really bothers us. 
But are there times when you've contradicted yourself? Made an effort to understand/ enjoy something because of the  positive fame enjoyed by an artist? This is where I'm at right now. I began listening to Bob Dylan and even though I love certain lyrics the music isn't my taste. So I decided to read his lyrics instead, and going through them a lot of it were descriptive of place, his youth, and experience with people. I can't find anything substantial that would make me believe that his music is better than a lot of great artists. I think his music reflected the sorrow felt at the time which led to his fame. "
3808,isfp,"I feel the same way you do about Star Wars, haha. I don't really have anything against it, I just feel like it's one of those things you have to have grown up with - like a party everyone loves to be a part of, but I arrived too late to join.
There is some mainstream stuff I am a fan of, some of which I only probably got into because they're mainstream. On the other hand, though, I feel a bigger sense of pride towards ""undiscovered"" stuff that I like, like what you said about finding music that can be your own."
3809,isfp,"For a long time I used to test and type myself as an ISTP. I think I misconstrued some of the questions or definitions I read online thus developing false notions of my mental process. Like, I used to think the value driven aspect of my character ""was"" principle based, or its entirely possible I just felt a lot of descriptions made feeler types sound mentally deficient. ¬Ø(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø
Any others encounter a similar problem or just have a story to tell?
What defining moment made you consider otherwise on your type?
Thank You,"
3810,isfp,"A few years ago when I first discovered MBTI I got INTJ in a quiz and thought I was INTJ, then I thought I was another type (not sure which one), then I found out the quizzes were bad and checked the cognitive functions, and typed myself as ISFP."
3811,isfp,A year ago I got Intp in a quiz and some of my friends too. But now we all did the same quiz again and we got all different types now. I got Isfp and also checked the functions and I have to admit that it fits really well.
3812,isfp,"How do I make this email appealing and inviting to my ISFP sister?

I'm wanting to show her why her mom treats her the way she does and how to deal with it. She doesn't realize why her mom acts the way she does, and it's hurting her. She also doesn't realize she needs to change her approach to choosing a career. She thinks she wants to be a K-12 teacher but doesn't realize what it's like.
She usually doesn't check nor respond to my emails nor texts, and I seem to bother her for some reason. I'm an INTP IAS. My Fe and Fi are pretty well-developed. I think showing her directly would cause issues."
3813,isfp,"Nope, ESTP, but my subtype is (isfp), so while my cognition follows the ESTP definition, I approach it with behavior and learning style in an (isfp) way. There is the subtype descriptions, but they only go so far as (ip), (ep), (ij), and (ej) so far. So in that way I'm ESTP(ip). More about subtypes here: http://www.alittlebitofpersonality.com/subtypes/"
3814,isfp,"Here's some musicians that (I think) are ISFPs:
David Bowie
Johnny Cash
Chris Cornell (Soundgarden)
Bob Dylan
Eric Clapton
Eminem
Art Garfunkel
Jimi Hendrix
Michael Jackson
Janis Joplin
Lil Wayne
Prince
Rihanna
Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam)
Layne Staley (Alice In Chains)
Kanye West
Neil Young"
3815,isfp,"I've taken the tests again recently and I got INFP and ENFP. The thing is when I got INFP I got like 51% N and 49% S. and when I got ENFP I got 51% on both E and N and 49% on I and S.
Before I would consistently get ISFP/INFP but I feel more of an ISFP.
I saw recently that someone here was mistyped as an ISTP and this made me start to think wether Im mistyped too. "
3816,isfp,"Im the ISTP/ISFP guy. Honestly. I feel like if you go into the test thinking of which type you are. You are gonna get it. This isn't always true though. I get either ISFP or ISTP completely based off of my mood. This is a result of my F to T being closely varied. I shift around 45% to 55%.
At the end of day. It doesn't matter. Its just a personality test online that has a large following. You're you dude. Not every ISFP is exactly like every other ISFP. The same is true for every type. Stop trying to jam yourself in a box. Don't be an ISFP/INFP/ENFP. Be you. Anything else would be bullshit."
3817,isfp,"rant incoming it's a big one:
i'm just fucking sick of friends, bosses, coworkers, people, parents, potential partners trying to control me. like they want to manipulate us into doing what they want when they don't fucking realise that if they just gave us the freedom and respected our autonomy then we might actually WANT to do what they want because SHOCKER we actually do want them them to be happy we just need to take care of ourselves first and WE know better than anyone what WE need. do they even realise that the more they try to cling and control the more they actually push us away?! maybe if you LET us do whatever we want you'd realise that ""whatever we want"" is actually really beautiful and can actually be in your best interests and way more satisfying than the bullshit you try to choke out of us?! maybe you're actually STAMPING OUT the creative potential that you're trying so hard to force out of us and in the process you're actually making us hate you. maybe if you just created a environment where we felt free to explore our potentials and have a great experience without pressure we would actually do something amazing. this has been the narrative my entire life even as a child like STOP MANIPULATING ME AND MAYBE I'LL ACTUALLY RESPECT YOU ENOUGH TO WANT TO DO THIS SHITTY THING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU. THERE'S AN IDEA HEY??!?! THAT I COULD ACTUALLY, SHOCKER, OF MY OWN VOLITION, WANT TO HELP YOU. THAT I'M AN ACTUAL PERSON AND NOT JUST A PAWN IN YOUR LITTLE GAME. it's so weird how we're the selfish ones when the actual pricks that just made us hate them don't realise that they've actually created their own self fulfilling prophecy. my boss was another one, micromanaging the shit out of me and stamping out my flame then complaining why i put such low effort a year later when i started off on such an enthusiastic high - like mate you actually destroyed any desire i had to create something nice for you, it's amazing that you can blame that on me when you just lost an employee that built sick shit that you actually had to beg for months afterwards for me to come back because you realised how difficult it was to replace me. same with friends who start putting pressure on me for this or that, like do you like me as i am or not, because i sure accept you as you are, if you value that in a person then stop trying to force me into your little story and let me make my own decisions. same with romantic partners who just want to take things too quickly when like you just destroyed any chance of me actually wanting to get with you at all, how about that? like fuck off. i'm so over it. from now on i'm just gonna tell people straight up that i'm not gonna abide their subtle attempts at manipulating and pressuring and if they want to enjoy what i have to offer they've actually got to chill the fuck out and let me do my thing. otherwise bye bye let me know when you've learned to stop sabotaging what you have. i'm done.
/rant
edit: and not only that, i'm sick of people just devaluing what i do only to learn later how much they depended on it..like did you think your weird hostile dictatorial environment would actually encourage me to keep producing value?? what the fuck are you on? like do you like ME or do you just like how well i follow your instructions and abide your hints and demands?"
3818,isfp,"It‚Äôs actually amazing how close to home this hits for me. My work has learnt that to get me to perform you literally leave me to it, or I‚Äôll make everything hell. My friends that have gotten too clingy or tried to change me or ignore me in a clingy or unhealthy way, I‚Äôve pushed them all back now, it‚Äôs going to take someone very special to get close to me again. And I‚Äôve been single for so long due to multiple issues that once again, I‚Äôd rather be single than with some toxic person.l that hindered my ability than just lets me live my life. I love my freedom, I love people being themselves and really achieving there goals but I can‚Äôt tolerate the manipulation or the clinginess that some people as you said was suffocating. "
3819,isfp,"Yeah i feel you. I'm totally happy to help someone with their goals at work or whatever situation for the pure satisfaction of helping, and contributing in my own way. But when I feel I'm being controlled or manipulated I will go completely in the opposite way and will completely disengage, turn into a shit employee/friend or just quit altogether "
3820,isfp,"I endorse this rant 100%
I could not have expressed what you just did as well as you did.  I relate to every word in it. 
Fuck those guys with a 10 foot pole.  
You know what?  Fuck them 10 times harder so they have an actual reason to bitch and whine about yourself being assertive.
Had someone INFURIATED and REVOLTED about me making the statement ""Do not nit pick and scold me all time time about petty ridiculous trivialities.""  OH MY GOD.  I WAS SO AUDACIOUS....FOR...WHAT WAS IT   oh ya.  They said my transgression was getting ""DEFENSIVE.""  And furthermore, it was ""EXACTLY WHAT I ALWAYS DO.  SHIT LIKE THIS.""  
Ya.  Well for this ""person,"" there will not be me being ""defensive"" again.  I let her know any attempt whatsoever to contact me in any circumstance will lead me to being ""offensive.""  I will hit her 10 times for the shit she intends to do to me in future, and 10 times for all the shit she has done to me in the last two years.  
You wake me up screaming to do some stupid assed shit like put a couple things in the trash I didn't do out of respect for them?   
You better hope it's not the 80th fucking time you have attempted to emotionally abuse me.  
It's over.
It's never fucking happening again."
3821,isfp,"Lol yeah. I just don't care about them. People that loves you and knows you won't pressure you into doing things you don't feel like doing.
I always welcome contrary thoughts tho. If I only act by impulse I would be a piece of shit."
3822,isfp,"People don't understand just how fucking capable inferior Te is of getting really fucking shitty.  Like way fucking over the top shitty and spiteful.  Just because it can, and just because yes, oh yes, it is so fucking absolutely mandatory and required, as in literally the most appropriate thing in the world to do, to do this thing one can, because damn it it has come to this, and noone ever in a million years would expect you to behaive in this manner, had the ability to do so, or would know exactly why it is so so so so very appropriate."
3823,isfp,"Well, being an Se essentially means we live in the moment, right? For me, it's true, I am very in tuned with my senses. And yes, I'm an artist who enjoys fashion, photography, and dance. I'm also terrible at planning for the future. When I communicate, I usually take my subject matter from what's around me. As an introvert, it usually means I end up constantly making puns and jokes from what people are saying around me, since I'm usually not the one initiating conversations. I think I daydream quite a bit for an Se, though."
3824,isfp,"It just means we are highly aware of what is around us. If you see someone walking in the street while looking at their shoes, he's probably an ISFP. Because Se forces us to be attentive to what is recordable through our senses. 
For example when I'm really hung over I enter Se hell. Everything that exist feels like an aggression. Music is just like information that forces itself into your head, it's horrible. Even a smile feels like an aggression because it's not about what the message is but that there is a message. Being badly hungover for me simply means staying in a dark room without any sound, light, items... just emptiness.
We get uncomfortable when staying in a room with the same person for too long. Because it's just keeps on recording. You just want it to shut up sometimes. And it's not that we need to feel alone but to really be alone. It's not about the feeling it's more that Se thing that keeps recording. It's like being forced to stare at a security camera.
Relationships, we are good with those. Because when we stay with someone it's like observing them none stop. Well it depends on what you do with your Fi of course. But for me, being with someone is being highly aware of that person. And if you know that person well you can guess what's in that person's head at all time almost (well, not like ""I'm in your head"" but more like Im reading the map of who you are through what you do). It's also why we don't commit. Because things that are repetitives really really really feel repetitive.
Some ISTPs think they understand others better than us. But nah there's no way. They might understand the theorical aspect of things a lot better than we do. But we just know people, we know their shit. What they are capable of, what are their blindspots, etc... Because Fi is really about making case by case logic. It's like building people inside of us."
3825,isfp,"My best friend is an ISFP. She seems to use her Se by making gifts and art for those she loves. This makes Christmas her favorite holiday of the year, because it's a chance to pour her Se on everyone.
She also works in an art department at a school, so I don't think she minds coming home to the same scene and same person (her husband - an INTP) every day. Maybe because after so much new Se, it's nice to have the familiar?"
3826,isfp,"This is exactly how I feel in my marriage (the good bits! not the repetitiveness). I know what my INTJ is thinking when he sets his jaw or when he sighs a certain way. I know the signs for when his depression is hitting him particularly hard. It makes it relatively simple for me to separate what is his solo-broody-battle and what he and I actually need to talk out to resolve. 
On the flip side, it is debilitating when my sensors are ""offline"" or when I'm wrong. Sometimes I misread the situation or he's upset about something unexpected. At those times, it feels like I'm an air traffic controller that lost her vision suddenly - all my signals make no sense. I'm overwhelmed and it feels like everything is happening at once. When I'm consciously trying to interpret all the security camera's data, it's significantly more challenging to make sense of it. "
3827,isfp,"For me personally, I connect with people through expression. Most of the time I don't directly engage people. Instead, I share my art to initiate conversation. I'm not into small talk, but I do like to discuss things I value. When it comes to large groups and gatherings, I keep relatively quiet unless I'm the center of attention (e.g. when I'm teaching a dance class). Rather than engaging people, I prefer to attract attention. I do much better in one on one situations and prefer it. I don't like fighting for people's attention in large groups, so one on ones and attracting attention really works for me. "
3828,isfp,"Straight from Thought Catalog:
Inferior Extroverted Thinking:
As an inferior function, Te originally manifests as the inability to set one‚Äôs external desires or plans into motion.
As Te matures, the user finds themselves steadily more able to source the resources they require to make their dreams a reality. They also find themselves developing the ability to express their thoughts to others in a straightforward, logical manner.
The inferior-Te monologue (prior to maturation):¬†‚ÄúI have many goals I want to accomplish but often have trouble tangibly setting them into motion. I fear being perceived as incompetent by others.‚Äù
I guess this means we have trouble executing what our Fi says, and we want others to recognize us when we do execute it."
3829,isfp,"Manifests unconsciously in blunt speech that may offend people. Also, inherent distrust of ‚Äòthe system‚Äô, corporations, red-tape, suits, the way things are run. Will seek help/assistance on technological issues and easily rages when it ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt do what its supposed to do.‚Äô"
3830,isfp,"I just wrote about this here  I'm an INFP so you at least have SE, the NE probably accounts for the more ADHD type behavior."
3831,isfp,"I don't see it as an inability to execute plans, though maybe following through sometimes is related.  I think it's more that we're bad at communicating to the tribe as a whole, like ... I can write as much music as I want and it can be amazing, but I inherently dislike shoving it in peoples' faces (advertising) because it feels ungenuine."
3832,isfp,Its the Extraverted Thinking function and its the 4th one in the isfp functions stack. Its has to do with planning and logic in the outside world rather than introverted thinking Ti which is like internal logic like being really good at solving math problems i guess?? Im not really that familiar with the thinking functions tbh.
3833,isfp,"I can see where you're going. I have fear of that too, I don't want to show my art so much because of that, but I know deep inside I want to be recognized for that, I would love that people would like my art without being inside my circles, and without telling them to like it, because that doesn't feel genuine as you said."
3834,isfp,"ISFP here. Always feel like I'm misunderstood. I feel like I'm broken because I'm not extroverted, I hate over-socializing, I spend 95% of my time alone. I'm just not getting what I want out of life and can't help think it's because of my personality. They even did a study where ISFPs made the least money and were the least satisfied with their jobs. Feeling worthless right now and just wanted to post in here. I've never even met another ISFP or someone I really connect with."
3835,isfp,"A) Don't worry about that study. It's mostly BS anyway.  
B) So you don't like over socializing and spend 95% of your time alone. Why is this a bad thing? If you don't like socializing, spending that much time alone could be nice. Do you simply wish you were more social? If so, you need to make a concerted effort to get out of your comfort zone and try being more social. Don't use your type as a crutch (I can't socialize because, look, I'm an I!). MBTI is a tool to better understand yourself and break free from any limitations you might unknowingly place upon yourself. So, you're an I and want to be more of an E? You now know that being extroverted will probably take more energy from you, but you CAN do it! "
3836,isfp,"Just wanted to say that that one study is complete BS, there are rich and poor, smart and dumb isfp people. don't paint yourself because a cool looking graph told you what you are supposed to be. As for not fitting a group, maybe broaden your circle of interactions with people. say you go to work and just say hi to your coworkers. every once in a while just ask them if they had a good weekend, what they're eating for lunch, it doesn't have to be anything more than something that gives an easy answer. just test the waters to see if you think you can be friends with any of these people. it also goes for school/whatever life position you're in. I say those past few sentences then say this, don't judge people prematurely,  get to know them a little and you will recognize that they aren't what you think they are. I've become friends with a couple of people I'd never thought I'd hang out with because I thought they were so unlike me, what if I never ""gave them a chance""? I would never had become really good friends with them. *it's also okay to be introverted, but I feel good after spending time with my friends (I'm like you, introverted) but I have like four really good friends that I socialize with, now I still like to be alone, but I also enjoy spending time with them.
just some advice"
3837,isfp,"I second dem feels, hippie commune anyone ? :P At 28 ivegrown up to deal with it but thst longing for a few core friends to connect with always gets me down, luckily I have my gf. Like /u/Starburstnova I'm not sure what to right that help but engaging with similar people like in this subreddit is a good move"
3838,isfp,"Don't let those studies get to you. I know a few ISFPs and most of them are quite successful in their careers, in fact one of them is a big time artist and well known in the video game industry. So, all I have to say is that when an ISFP finds and follows their passion you will find your success :D"
3839,isfp,"lol The hell. Go trip on lsd or something to find yourself. Where the hell are you getting your info. Last I check INFP made the least. 
Are you not finding a creative outlet? I'm not a people person, but I have a lot of great friends. Made a lot of friends by just showing off my talent as a designer. 
Found a job where I feel needed. Being a designer/front-end web developer a lot of friends and people ask me for creative advice and critiques. Go do something to change yourself and find people you can relate to. 
Tldr stop being a boring isfp. "
3840,isfp,Lol no one says anything about being an artist. Majority isfp have a creative outlet. You should find yours and work on it. I firmly believe isfp doesn't suck in life. In fact I believe isfp are masters at observations. We just need to find inspiration and find a connection. Enjoy life and take risks. Question what you don't understand and understand your experiences/feelings. Good luck and feel better. To be honest I think the reason why this subreddit is kind of dead is because isfp are way too busy enjoying the present. 
3841,isfp,"I put a post on here a little over a week ago for people to drop their favorite songs. I knew going in that the playlist was going to be an absolute monster. Dozens of peoples musical tastes colliding together to create a beautiful mess. I left off a few songs because I tried to keep it to one song per person. Well here is it. This is what we made.
Ultimate ISFP Playlist
Also feel free to collaborate. I made the thing public. I encourage you to add your own music. Just one or two songs though. I selfishly added a second song to it myself. You can use this link to collaborate on it.

3842,isfp,Is she spending more time than usual around you? Does she participate in group activities more if you‚Äôre included? Does she make an effort to talk to you though it may be awkward? Has her personal style improved? Does she fill you in more on the details of her life and want to know more about yours? Does she ‚Äújust happen‚Äù to be in the same vicinity you are? Do some of your favorite things become some of her favorite things too?
3843,isfp,"For real! If I like someone, I will treat them exactly the same as I would any of my friends (if we‚Äôre friends). If I don‚Äôt know them personally, I will show absolutely no indication of interest; I won‚Äôt stare or approach them or anything, other than glancing at them through my peripheral vision."
3844,isfp,"By definition, successful means achieving the things that you wished for. So it's all relative! For someone it can be a happy, harmonious home. For someone it can be multi-million dollars. For someone it can be the key to the White House. For someone it can be getting humanity to Mars...
For me, I just want to find my place  and add joy to the world. There is still so much negativity in the world. I can help dispel that by being a joyful person who makes people happy.
Edit: So, to answer your question, ""A successful person is someone who achieved what they longed for."""
3845,isfp,I agree but I want to add that sometimes what we want isn't what we actually want. Would you say someone who spent his whole life achieving fame and fortune only to find it meaningless and empty in the end successful? Or on the other end someone who lived a harmonious life only to feel regretful and small in the end successful? To this question do you feel it is possible to try at something with all your effort without on some level knowing if it is what you truely want?
3846,isfp,"I have problem defining word successful. Few days ago I came up with this weird concept of successfulness: ""You just have to convince people that You achieved those goals, You don't have to achieve them fully. What matters is how people perceive You."""
3847,isfp,"Thanks to r/isfp, I was able to do the following things:
-(After being asked out but before we went out) texted the guy several times, Christmas Eve, Christmas, how his day was   
-After waiting for him to make the first move, asked him to coffee   
-Texted him to let him know that if he needed space, he could let me know and I would be ok with it   
-After slow textual responses, asked him to take a walk with me through Ikea, which he really liked   
-Told him that I liked him in the car and that I didn't want to push him, but that I needed some reassurance that he liked me and that I was willing to be patient with him so that we could build up trust   
-He was more open (even texting me first) after I told him that I liked him outright (which was scary), and told me that it was really thoughtful of me to have researched his personality type to better understand him and that he liked feeling more understood. He also told me that he would work on initiating more and being more relational which I am super excited for   
I really like him, so thank you this subreddit!! This place helped me better understand that it was a big freaking deal when he asked me out because it was a big risk on his part! I would have never known that he liked me and even after he asked me, I still wasn't sure because he wasn't very effusive or affectionate, but thanks to this subreddit, it helped me to not be so insecure and just be patient.     
I am excited for what is in store and will probably be back in the future. We haven't gone out on our official official date yet, where he asks me out and sets the time and place, but for now I want to give him that space to do that so he knows that I care that that is what he needs. There's more I want to say, but I don't want to overwhelm, so I'll keep it short (ish)!
PS, sorry for the not conciseness, ISFP's, I ramble :o
Edit: formatting"
3848,isfp,"aw, thank you! i admit, i was nervous, but it was true and i wanted to be honest if it would help him to feel more at ease. i am a bit more vocal so i still get insecure because i never tell if he likes me, but then he'll go and admit that he thinks about me more than he cares to admit, and it'll surprise me! i probably wouldn't have told him if not for this subreddit, since i would have wanted him to tell me first :)"
3849,isfp,"I literally just stabbed myself in the hand and now I can't feel my middle finger. I don't have anyone in my life other than those related to me by blood. I dislike my mom and I feel pretty close to nothing for my dad. I feel kind of shut out by my oldest friend she doesn't talk to me anymore. I'm sorry if I shouldn't have posted this here. 
Edit: Thank you all for the responses and the messages, it means a lot. I'm so proud to be an ISFP and have that to share with you all. As far as my episode last night goes, it appears to be a bad reaction to the bupropion I was prescribed last week. I had an appointment with him this morning, told him about the hand, and he's got me on something new. And now for my hand, I went to the hospital at 5am due to trouble sleeping with the pain. They xrayed it and no serious damage. I just need to keep it clean and it should heal in about a week. Again, thank you all so much. :)"
3850,isfp,You know what helps me feel better? Just going for a walk in the woods with my dog. I have been struggling with clinical depression for a while and I just want to tell you that there are always people who care about you; Even internet strangers! hug 
3851,isfp,"So true about walks... Don't keep walking and stare at your feet, but stop once in a while and appreciate what you see & hear. I even go on a walk if it rains... It sucks in the beginning, but when you are soaking wet you'll realise it's just water and not too bad. This is what happens in life; people worry too much about the future till they arrive at the point where they were worried about and realise it's not too bad.
What happend to your finger? If it's bad you should get it checked out by a doctor. Although it sounds tempting at the moment, you don't want to walk around all your life flipping the bird on everybody.
What do you like to do? Do you have hobbies or passions? Doesn't matter what it is, but you will meet new people through that. Friends will come and go and don't take that personal! People wil grow apart, because of different interests, relocation, different schools/colleges and different group of friends. Sometimes a friendship needs a break and you'll connect later. Just don't keep wasting energy in a broken friendship. Unless she doesn't talk because she feels down or is in trouble ofcourse.
Life is a mixture of sunshine and rain, teardrops and laughter, pleasure and pain. Just remember, there was never a cloud that the sun couldn't shine through."

Scrolling through here I see a lot of people that are struggling, so figured why not start a string of some of our favorite quotes or sayings for those who are struggling to read for motivation.
My personal favorites:
-My past shaped who I am today. Today shapes who I will be tomorrow.

Think more than you speak, know more than you say, notice more then they realize.

-Give it all or give it up.
-I do it for you
-Both the sheep and the wolf are wandering through life."

3854,isfp,"Disney's Tarzan (Takes the place for my favorite disney movie)
The Last Train to Busan (The best zombie movie I have ever seen. No contest.)
Into the Spiderverse (Best spider man movie to date)
Dale and Tucker VS Evil (That movie probably isn't very good, but it is hilarious)
The Star Wars Franchise changed my life.
The Butterfly Effect (Probably my single favorite movie)
The Matrix (A movie that was better upon a second viewing ten years later)
Law Abiding Citizen (I fucking love Gerard Butler)
Watchmen (I don't really understand the depths of the characters, but the movie was good none the less)
Baby Driver (Made me wanna be a get away driver)
Kingsman 1 and 2 (I hope they make ten more)"

Lol. I love movies! "
3856,isfp,"Each ISFP has their internal values that guide their sense of right and wrong. I believe most of you know this. The reason I have felt so conflicted for so long is because I never understood that I need to take a mix and match approach to making decisions with these. The reason I could never stick to one set of values is because each one doesn't apply to everything. In different situations, different things are important. I've never really been able to make sense of my opinions because of this. I have been trying to logically group the world into these categories, but while the values have logical definitions, they have abstract applications. I might be explaining this incoherently, but I just had a big aha moment for myself.
EDIT: Forgot to include how the other 3 functions work in very complex and interesting ways with Fi, but yeah that's a whole other topic"
3857,isfp,"Been thinking this exact thing for a couple months now after l found the Myers briggs test. Before I discovered mbti I though I was a weak person for changing my values so often. Now I feel I'm just constantly sculpting them and adapting as I go, always getting closer to learning what my true values are deep down. I suppose constantly changing values is a value in itself, as were valuing what's best for everyone involved in the current moment while disregarding our personal values held prior. "
3858,isfp,"I just took a personality test, having forgotten what my results were the first time I took it. I was given 4 potential options that fit my answers, but overall, I related most to isfp, by far. My SO and I took the test at the same time(he's intj), and he was reading to me some funny and interesting things posted on that sub.
Looking through this sub, curious as to what other isfp's had to say and wondering how it would relate to the intj sub, I realized how few and far between posts are. 
I came to the conclusion that it absolutely makes sense as to why it's a bit slow. We, as isfp's, enjoy to contribute relevant information to pre-existing conversation. We're not much of conversation starters, but we always rack our brains for things we can contribute. It seems more likely to me that we would comment on threads rather than create our own.
Thoughts, comments, concerns?

3859,isfp,"I totally know what you're talking about lol.  I rarely start threads, and occasionally comment on them.  There are at least two times in this sub where I've written an entire paragraph in response to a question only to delete the whole thing for fear of...something."
3860,isfp,"I just love listening. I'd rather you started the conversation so that I can find our common ground. Tell me your secrets, thoughts and experiences - I'll run them through my own and tell you where I can relate to you so that we can enjoy that connection together. 
I almost didn't post a reply because I didn't have something ""better"" to add to the conversation. :)"
3861,isfp,"Not saying it's a bad thing, but this gets said by newcomers to the isfp subreddit a lot. Usually in the comments, but take comefort in knowing all the other isfp figured out the exact same thing you did, that we just like to contribute what's relevant and unique to out perspective."
3862,isfp,"Completely late to the party, but I just said something like this in a more recent post and I'm just in awe of how much we do think alike. I literally said that I don't usually start conversations but I like to contribute to them. This observation is spot on."
3863,isfp,"I'm an INTJ and my SO is an ISFP. I was wondering if you could comment a little more on your relationship...specifically something he does that you appreciate. I'm curious because our types aren't supposed to mix well. INTJs being overly judgmental and all that. :) We get along swimmingly, don't get me wrong, but this is the first case I've heard of another INTJ/ISFP, and I'm always open to learning ways to improve."
3864,isfp,"For my myself, I could finish that sentence with ""fear of people thinking what I said was stupid, or having someone disagree with me"". Don't get me wrong, I love a good debate, but if I say something that someone else criticizes and thinks I'm unintelligent for, that kills me inside. I am very bad at handling rejection, embarrassment, or anything of that nature. "
3865,isfp,"I think you has something really good to contribute! Thanks for that :) 
I completely agree with you; I love to be a good listener, because I love when people trust me enough to tell me their secrets and experiences. Little gives me more pleasure than hearing about others' stories and being able to either a) contribute my own thoughts and experiences to their own, or b) gain some type of knowledge from their experience that I'll be able to use later on. I also love to feel liked, so when people tell me things about them, it absolutely makes me feel like they like me. "
3866,isfp,"Exactly! I feel the same way. People always say ""you're always so quiet/you don't say much"" and I usually reply with ""it's because I don't have anything to say right now"". I don't contribute thoughts unless it's something important or that can contribute to what others are saying. Also, whenever I do end up saying the first thing that pops into my head, it's usually something really stupid and I just embarrass myself.... "
3867,isfp,"Thanks for commenting with this, I have also yet to see another INTJ/ISFP relationship. Something I appreciate, huh? Well, he's very in tune with the way that I think/the way my mind works, and I always love when he comments about something along those lines. A common example I could give to you would be him saying something along the lines of, ""I know you're about to say..."" or ""I know you're thinking that..."", following up with something that I would actually do, as opposed to something generic that anyone could be thinking. Does that make sense? As an INTJ yourself, I'm sure you're the same in that you're very observant and able to read people.
I don't know if I can speak for all ISFPs on this aspect, but I know that my favorite thing in the world to be complemented on is my intelligence or the way I think. He knows that if he really wants to make me smile like an idiot, he'll call me a genius. I just can't stress enough how much I appreciate him commenting on the way I think.
I'm also curious to hear how your relationship is :) My SO and I are fantastic together, despite our different personalities. We're both very observant and perceptive of others, yet we have fairly difference perspectives of things. We can definitely clash in our ideas of things, but I think we both enjoy bouncing those different ideas off of each other. I love the relationship in regard to our personality differences, because I think it's always exciting to hear a perspective that's completely different from your own. 
I hope I answered your question(plus some more :P), and I hope to hear some more from your point of view."
3868,isfp,"You are so sweet! :D And astute! I totally feel ""special"" when someone confides in me. 
Plus, I would HATE to offend anyone unintentionally so listening first prevents that nasty foot-in-mouth thing that seems to be going around."
3869,isfp,"OP's SO here. To give a little more insight into my perspective - The relationship is quite rewarding on the intellectual level that INTJ's often take as a requisite for a positive relationship. One of the greatest things for an INTJ, like myself, is to have people listen to you like you're the genius you are. But the cool thing about dating OP is that she's not just some fan girl of my cerebral abilities, but she compliments them. For example, if I have an especially stimulating subject to explore, OP will listen with true and unadulterated, undivided attention to every word I say (which is an amazing feeling for any individual), but instead of just remaining silent post-facto, she's really inquisitive and often offers really insightful commentary on the discussion at hand. 
I think one of the best things I can do to show my affections towards her is to go out of typical INTJ comfort zone and be as sincere as possible. That means that when she wows me with her genius, I compliment it. INTJ's tend to be 'cold' or monotone on the surface, but we have pretty colorful thoughts and ideas that we just need to feel comfortable sharing. Just try to keep a goal of inclusion into your mind. 
Love you, babe <3"
3870,isfp,"Thanks so much for the comments, guys. You both put things more eloquently than I could hope to haha.
I was with my fiance when reading your comment, /u/DatSloth, and we couldn't help but laugh on how familiar it sounded, especially the ""I know what you're thinking"" bit. I find that she often surprises me, though!
We also love exactly what you had mentioned, bouncing ideas off of each other...where I'm quick to be critical of someone, she offers insight into why they're acting a certain why, and is very empathetic. She really helps me to be more understanding, and I really need that sometimes.
I love just introducing her to something, for example a character in a video game or a movie, or even just a picture or piece of art, and just gauging her reaction to it. A lot of times she'll pick up on the expression on someone's face, or just their tone of voice, and she'll have a whole backstory thought up and have an emotional attachment to them. I can rarely guess if she's going to feel positively or negatively about a person prior to her meeting them, and I'm just in constant amazement at the things she points out. It really adds depth to things that I might not have appreciated as much before.
I'd say that one of the hardest things that we go through is when she wants to do something that I don't particularly enjoy. I'm more than willing to put my personal preferences aside to make hew happy, because she'll be much sadder about not doing something than I would be doing it, but if she knows that I don't really want to do something, then she gets sad because she thinks I'm sad....it just turns into a loop of both of us being unhappy merely because the other is unhappy haha. I try to be very careful not to elude to the fact that I might just be doing something for her benefit, rather than because I actually want to do it.
Sorry if any of that was difficult to understand. I'm not the greatest at putting my thoughts down into writing. Thanks for the replies, though, and I hope you got something out of it."
3871,isfp,"And unable to explain to people because your original intentions came out wrong and annoyed them and you really want to explain but don't want to bother them and annoy them more than you already have? 
Or maybe it's all in my head? I wish i could just ask her but she'll just think I'm annoying... She just left for work without saying a word "
3872,isfp,"yea i get it, sometimes words cant explain everything. i also hate when i try to explain something i realized to someone and since its usually like incomprehensible ? they look at me like wtf but ya good luck"
3873,isfp,"How do you guys feel about your work-life balance? What do you do? Do you plan on staying the course or considering new options if you‚Äôre not happy?
Me: I feel burnt out and exhausted every day. Even when I have a completely free weekend, long weekend, or I take vacation days; I feel tired. Not sure if that‚Äôs the norm or if my career is just too demanding. (I do Financial Management in the Marine Corps)"
3874,isfp,"I understand how you feel man. I‚Äôm in a service industry as well and sometimes it can be overwhelming. 
I try to think of work-life balance as a pendulum. Sometimes work is going to require a greater portion of your attention, but you just have to make sure the pendulum swings back and you end up with some time where you can recharge and spend time on the things you want to. "
3875,isfp,"I'm a security guard and it's fine, but doesn't pay enough and there is not much respect from other people, so I'm trying to do other stuff. right now graphic design looks good, but we'll see. 
I work almost every day and my schedule is really strange, and have many days where I feel like I don't get enough sleep. I also go to the gym 6x a week so I'm tired from that too. I'm trying to change to just working during the day(rather than at night + day), but I don't know when that'll happen"
3876,isfp,"(ISTP) I work in a junk mail factory making (you guessed it) mail. I run machines that take giant rolls of paper and cut and fold them as needed for the job, and that gets sent to another dept. Pay is based on how much my machine runs in a shift, or $10/hour, whichever is greater. When the machine is running it's great but super boring, if not, it can get extremely stressful because my dept doesn't have a mechanic, so it's up to each operator to know how to fix their machine, and if it's not running, you're not getting paid. Anyways, I work 3 on/3 off, 4 on/4 off, 12 hour shifts. The days off are admittedly quite nice, but then once it's time to go back to work, there is just no free time to even unwind after work, it's literally get home, shower, eat, dishes, pack lunch for the next day, and then it's about time to go to bed. Like I said, the days off are nice, but I really wouldn't mind working an 8 hour day 5 days a week, or even 10 hours 4 days a week, just to have a few more hours to actually relax after work."
3877,isfp,"I‚Äôm very lucky where I am, I work as a charity shop manager (and I‚Äôm a training shop manager). I work between 8-10 hours a day and I get to move around and work in other places quite often. I hate being in the same place for too long as I simply get bored and demotivated. I had this problem last year, but since I spoke to my boss it‚Äôs all turned around and now I‚Äôm very happy with my work.  "
3878,isfp,"I know a lot of ISFPs who have 6 and 9 in their tritype. 6s are known to be security-oriented and correlated with Si. 9 is all about that comfort. I know many Fe users who have 6 and 9 in their tritype too. With all of this, I'd assume some ISFPs appear more like Si users than Se users. If not, I'd assume the 6 and 9 would at least lessen how ""Se"" they are.
So to you ISFPs, how strong is your Se? Do you all love change, physical activities, getting ""lit"", thrill, taking risks, etc? If not, how does your Se work?"
3879,isfp,"My Se is pretty weak. I don't pay attention to my surroundings at all sometimes. I think it's because I'm maturing and focusing on my Ni right now. 
I have to get back focusing on Se. ;)
I am enneagram 4w3."
3880,isfp,"Well I'm still in school so I can't do a lot of outlandish stuff. But I enjoy reading the most and if I have enough money in the future, travel. My family don't have much money and I've rarely been out of state so it would amazing to explore and see different cultures and places. "
3881,isfp,"Frequently. I just need to find time. I want to learn how to play guitar. I've taken a few lessons but I've stopped for a while. Planning to get back on it. I've dabbled in a few hobbies but I always lose interest. I was into writing, then graphic design, editing/filmmaking, maybe something psychology related. But I've always loved reading. "
3882,isfp,"I mean no offense whatsoever, but as an ENFP, I can't stand how the intelligent and creative ISFPs in my life seem to be lacking a sort of emotional/spiritual/ philosophical depth that I am almost certain they are capable of understanding but simply don't possess. It's definitely an N/S clash--""N"" types, especially ""NF""s (idealists) tend to be more abstract in nature than their ""concrete"" S counterparts. 
More specifically, I'm baffled by how many of my ISFP friends have mature taste in literature and film--art that champions deep thought and the more nuanced moments in life--all while being drawn to the most hackneyed and unoriginal, Pinterest-esque, ideals in their own lives that are more reminiscent of an 8 year old girl's daydreams than anything. Some of my 25+ year old ISFP friends Tumble, ""Pin"" and Instagram stock photos of things like puppies in chic NYC lofts, B&W glamour shots of lovers they don't even know holding hands, and, most offensively,misappropriated quotes (e.g.""'One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.""). 
Sorry to be so imprecise, I hope all this rambling is making at least a little bit of sense. Would any of you mind sharing why some of your peers get off on the more conventional and oversimplified ornaments in life despite being capable of at least  understanding the more complex side of things?"
3883,isfp,"Maybe you haven't met the right ISFPs. Many of us are spiritual and philosophical, though personally I am less likely to share my deeper convictions due to a mix of not being socially the quickest and non-confrontational. When I talk about my ideas they are sometimes shot down before I have the time to a. sort out my feelings on not being received well b. formulate a response to clarify/explain."
3884,isfp,"I think you are judging your ISFP friends a little harshly. Maybe these images that you consider conventional are very stimulating to your friends' imaginations. Maybe they evoke powerful memories or desires. Most popular music utilizes very generic lyrics because they are easily related to by a wide range of people; knowing this doesn't keep me or others from finding them meaningful. Personally, I enjoy entertaining my romantic, wishful side in this way.
As for expressing our own depth of thought to someone else, SpaceTigers described it perfectly. I don't like having deep, meaningful conversations with most people, because my words have a tendency to just fall out of my mouth. I can count on one hand the people I've known with whom I could comfortably engage in conversation."
3885,isfp,"I'm curious, what do you consider to be things that have depth or what would you like to see them post?  I have trouble seeing what's wrong with it aside from the fact that its a little boring.  I kinda see the gripe about the quote, but your friends probably just thought it was a cool quote and didn't know where it came from.  Otherwise, I don't really understand what bothers you so much."
3886,isfp,"""When you start a sentence with 'No offense', it usually means you're about to offend someone.""
Emotional/spiritual/philosophical depth:
You have grouped three distinctly different things to embody what you feel is lacking in ISFPs. I think that you may just A) not yet have the type of relationship where the ISFPs in your life will open those doors to you, B) be mistaking Se statements and sum-up/surface understandings as the cutoff for their understanding and depth of thought in that area, and C) not be opening the right doors socially.
I dunno if it's an ISFP trait, but for me once things are out of systems and all up in the air things can become so meaningless to communicate that I end up not talking about it. I had an ENFP once telling me about his spiritual experiences on shrooms and I politely continued the conversation, but what he categorized as spiritual emotions seemed to me very base and primitive emotions. For me spirituality is about understanding my place in things and the forces of the real world, not an ambiguous heightening of emotions and unconscious knowing. 
I often want to discuss things with my ENTP and INTJ friends, though I think they're kinda full of BS when it comes to spirituality. (The INTJ feels like he's had a past life but refuses to research or go further and put limits and talking points to his theory. I have given up, haha.) My mother is an ENFJ and I can't even get on her unsystematic emotional level to understand her value judgements, so I just observe. 
I always feel like I'm on the weaker side of expression itself when it comes to talking about these things, and my non IP friends tend to get bored and want to discuss something new because I've taken a long time to say something little. When I try to make sum-up statements, someone usually misunderstands me. I think the key to being on the receiving end of ISFP spiritual discussion is listening, and listening requires patience."
3887,isfp,"Yeah, people can appear ""shallow"" to you if you've got higher standards for things like music taste, philosophy, or content shared on social media.  I do it too, I hate when someone lists off all of their favourite popular bands or says ""I like all music"" because I've got very ""refined"" taste.  At the end of the day however we're experiencing the same feelings.  Maybe they're even experiencing deeper feelings by not having such a refined taste and not having been exposed to as much music as I have?  "
3888,isfp,"Personally, I'm distracting myself. When I think about the world, how I really feel about it, how it works and how I can't do anything about it, it very deeply upsets me. So I sit on reddit and look at other people's cats or look at cute outfits on Pintrest, or watch Buzzfeed on YouTube. I know I do it too much, but I just really haven't grasped a solid coping mechanism."
3889,isfp,"I find this OP hilariously cringe-worthy.
Hey, OP! It's called the Se function; you probably haven't heard of it or used it once in your damn life! 
Don't pawn your narrow-minded perspectives off on all intuitive types; your particular affliction is one virtually exclusive to Ne-function-dominant types - ENTP and ENFP - and any intuitive type with dominant Ni is going to have no difficulty comprehending an Se-user's appreciation of simple and tangible things, regardless the depth of our interest in the complex and theoretical.
Furthermore, aesthetics are not a universal demonstration of personal philosophy, spirituality, and ideology. Your belief that they are is, yet again, your Ne and Si talking. A lot of people are extremely private and internal about their worldview, they don't enjoy sharing it or exposing it to other people's scrutiny, and when you (an Extravert!!) get judgmental about them (Introverts!!) not baring their entire philosophical attitudes for you to debate them, or for you to have the excuse to blast your own in their faces, it only further justifies their lack of any desire to share those things with you.
TL;DR - You're being a prick about this, mate, and you're using false dichotomies and ignoring cognitive functions in your efforts to justify being a prick."
3890,isfp,"You know, I think you're maybe being a bit condescending about this. As an INFP, I utilize my extroverted iNtuition regularly, but I certainly appreciate beauty and life in the present as well. We all utilize the cognitive functions, we just use some more and in different ways. You should approach your relationships with your ISFP friends with a bit more understanding and flexibility."
3891,isfp,"An explanation for the people who don't understand. Or for the people who are intrigued by your deep thoughts and want more information.
You did bring up a rather interesting point. Y'know, about how iNtuitives probably don't appreciate the magnificence of the now as much as they could or should. Hm... Perhaps I should think about this some more..."
3892,isfp,"Yeah, I'm thinking he just met the wrong ISFP's or something. I used to spend quite a long time contemplating philosophy until I hammered down what I actually believe. It's one of my favorite subjects, even though I wouldn't consider myself to be religious in any way."
3893,isfp,"Can I ask you when you felt like your philosophies suddenly solidified? I am 21 and I am still very much shifting my beliefs, accommodating new bits of info, but not in a bad way, like organized chaos. "
3894,isfp,"Well, I'm fresh out of High School. I was raised Catholic, went to a Catholic high school that actually had good philosophy classes, and was fortunate enough to have a dad that didn't force his beliefs on me. By the end of Junior and Senior year I had taken three semesters of Philosophy with a huge emphasis on morality, justice, and questioning. At the end of my last semester, I had to write a paper about what my current beliefs were. 
Unfortunately, I came to the conclusion that I can never really know anything so I'm not going to let it impact my daily life. After a lot of thought I came to some answers that sounded logical to me, but I think in the end it was more for fun, even if I still stand by those answers today. I don't see any reason to let metaphysics interrupt my daily life if there is no way to prove it.
I kind of just try to live by the ancient proverb, ""Don't be an asshole."" If someone were to ask me why, I'd have an answer for them, but it's not like that answer is in my mind when I try to do good things for people. I still like to think about it for entertainment or to keep my mind busy but it's not a huge part of my life. When it comes to metaphysics, ignorance is bliss, I guess.
Anyway, that's how I am with Philosophy at this point in my life. Sorry if it's too long."
3895,isfp,"That's probably the best explanation for how I feel about my opinions too. Thanks for saying that - I'm sure you understand, being an ISFP, that it's nice having someone put these chaotic feelings into words. 
I always found opinions so strange. I have a few very strong ones (which bring out my shadow INTJ which can be scary lol) but for the most part I refrain from talking about them for fear of insulting someone. I also find that if I speak my mind and somebody calls me out on something I said I get frustrated. Mostly because these opinions are usually not to be taken seriously, like you said. They're answers to things I cannot answer. Therefore everyone's opinion has a level of truth to me since I figure they have come to the same conclusion about their's as I have about mine. "
3896,isfp,"Yep, I know how that is :)
For me it really depends on the situation that I'm in. I'm usually pretty quick to say my opinion unless they said something so incredibly opposite to what I believe that I'll come across as being disrespectful. I like to think that I'm pretty respectful to other people's beliefs but sometimes I can be pretty judging. It's usually when someone says something like, ""Everything happens for a reason"" and I immediately come up with multiple reasons why that doesn't make sense. It bothers me that people don't put nearly as much thought into this sort of stuff as I did. It's usually in this situation where I have to keep my mouth shut."
3897,isfp,"Basically any time I talk to someone of the opposite gender, 99% of the time I get a little crush on them. I usually struggle to be close friends with a guy unless I am not attract d to him in the slightest. I just think people in general are super cute once you get to know them.., are any of you like this?"
3898,isfp,"No. I could count how many crushes I've had on one hand. But I would get ""friend crushes"", like I want to be someone's friend because they seem cool or whatever, but I'm always too nervous to say anything because social anxiety."
3899,isfp,"If you mean crushes as in small infatuations, then I absolutely develop those not only easily but often; I tend to notice little things about certain people that I like and it turns into a vague attraction, but it doesn‚Äôt usually last long. "
3900,isfp,I find them almost impossible to get along with. It annoys me to no end how they think they have me/other people ‚Äúfigured out‚Äù and they usually come off as really disingenuous to me. I also just find it hard to talk to them about things in general unless it‚Äôs super abstract (not interesting) or about me (I‚Äôm very private). They seem to need to control the conversation all the time and if it doesn‚Äôt go their way they start to get weirdly stressed. 
3901,isfp,"Yes, actually! I tend to get along with just about everyone, but INFJs tend to rub me wrong. Usually I‚Äôll try being friends with them, and they‚Äôll end up being kind of cold or rude, so I think it‚Äôs more that INFJs don‚Äôt like me for whatever reason. Usually, the INFJs I‚Äôve known have been kind of loners, so I try to befriend them, and they just do not like me.
I knew an INFJ who‚Äôs family immigrated here illegally, so her family was pretty financially unstable. I became friends with her (or so I thought) and learned that a lot of times, they didn‚Äôt have food in their house, so I started bringing her lunch everyday. I didn‚Äôt make a big deal about it in front of others and she always seemed grateful. At the end of the year, one of my best friends told me that the INFJ said that I was annoying. I don‚Äôt get my feelings hurt super easily but damn that hurt. When I messaged her about it (basically ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm really sorry if I got on your nerves, but I wish you would‚Äôve asked me to back off instead of talking about me behind my back‚Äù.) she was super apologetic and said that ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt think I thought of her as a friend either‚Äù.
Though my experiences with other INFJs haven‚Äôt been as extreme, they‚Äôve been similar. Idk, INFJs tend to seem kind of nice at first but end up being kind of fake and self absorbed. It might just be something about me, too, but I think I‚Äôve had more negative experiences with INFJs than any other type."
3902,isfp,"Yes. They‚Äôre totally self absorbed. I‚Äôm in an ISTP group on Facebook because I border ISFP/ISTP and that personality type, in particular, (along with INTJ‚Äôs) are constantly barging into conversations uninvited to share their opinion. INFJ‚Äôs appear to at least want to contribute to a conversation but they manage to be overly involved and feely. INTJ‚Äôs want to dominate a discussion and make everyone else look inferior. They‚Äôre so fucking annoying. "
3903,isfp,"I've been spending a lot of time on the istp sub and I've been really enjoying myself. I love their similar sense of humor and they have really interesting and relatable ways of thinking. While they can seem hostile or inconsiderate, they're a okay I'm my book.
How do you feel about them? Are they too harsh for you or can you overlook their Ti dom and let them get a laugh out of you?"
3904,isfp,"I truly feel like they‚Äôre the only ones of any other type who ‚Äúget‚Äù me, even though it seems like we are on completely different wavelengths most (if not all) of the time. Ah, that Fi Ti clash.
They are near impossible to read. In the case of my ISTP bf, when we were first getting to know each other, I had no idea he was remotely interested in me. Couldn‚Äôt tell if he wanted to kiss me or kill me. Eventually I got the message ;p 
A concern that popped up later was that I didn‚Äôt feel like he understood me when I came to him with certain problems... like he couldn‚Äôt empathize ‚Äúproperly‚Äù. So frustrating. But I learned he empathizes very much indeed, just in his own practical way.  
One of my favorite places to hang out is in my ISTP cousin‚Äôs auto shop. Sometimes we don‚Äôt even talk to each other, just hang out in a comfortable silence lol.
They are so inherently helpful.
They can certainly come off as harsh and rude to some, but I respect their honesty, even though our views don‚Äôt always jive. We usually come to an amicable disagreement.
Sometimes they are so deadpan and straightforward with their thoughts/opinions it comes off as unintentionally funny and I start laughing. I only laugh harder at their puzzled expressions.
I read somewhere that they are very ‚Äúcatlike‚Äù people - an apt description.
Anyway, those are my scattered thoughts. As for the ISTPs I personally know, I cherish them all :)"
3905,isfp,"My younger brother and one of my friends are both ISTPs. My little brother is one of my best friends, he gets my jokes and odd humor. The other ISTP I know is almost a decade older than my brother and it's really interesting to talk to her. There will be times where we're talking about whatever topic and the stuff she says sounds like it would come from my brother.  Anyways, my opinion on ISTPs is that they're cool people. Definitely can be prickly and rough around the edges, but in a way that's kind of they're allure to me."
3906,isfp,"I've known some pretty cool ISTP's before. During one of my first part time jobs. (when i was like 19)
There was this male ISTP who was a few years older than me, we had jobs where we had to work together. He would lecture me on how to do the job ( in a very freindly manner), and then then we'd have conversations about what i was studying for college and then i'd ask him about what he did and etc..........
Like he'd act genuinely concerned about me and it felt real lol. He kind of seemed like an older brother ( not really, but i had the vibe)
The thing i like about freindships with SP's is that it's a lot more thrilling, like, we don't just talk, we exchange banter and sometimes it can even get a bit aggressive. ( like jokingly aggressive) ( but i like that)
Compared to relationships with XSFJ's, those are more of just completely an passive exchange of deep/superficial words and feelings.
Both can be fun though.( it depends on my mood of course)"
3907,isfp,"With my ISTP friend-
We get each other's humor and enjoy hanging out in a group, but we're both too quiet and chill to keep a conversation going with just us (even though we'd like to). We're both kind of the observers in the group. It's unfortunate, I feel like I'm missing out."
3908,isfp,"I'm generally really attracted to istps. They are really laidback, and it is real easy to just chill out with them. I always try to get any reaction out of them because most of the ones I know try to hide how they are feeling. I really like trying to get them to laugh haha. However, something I don't like is when they are angry. The istps in my life get suuuper passive and turn into ""brats"" when they are mad. It is like they really want you to see how mad they are without having to verbally tell you. I also see them as the type of people who need to be around people and craves being with friends, but also needs to have space and be alone. I think they are very relatable"
3909,isfp,Could you give me an example?
3910,isfp,"Don‚Äôt worry! They are hiding in plain sight ;) 
Although my bf is into outdoorsy stuff like running/hiking/swimming, we didn‚Äôt meet through those activities - it was first in a chemistry class. Anything science-related is not my forte, and as luck would have it, he was my assigned partner for the lab work. In short, he was my savior lol. Actually, that should have been my first clue-in that he was interested; all the time he took out of his work to help me."
3911,isfp,"I took a French class a few semesters ago. The first day of class, our professor started making us have little conversations in French with each other to pick up the language better - which didn‚Äôt make sense, since we had barely learned anything. 
So I turned to my ISTP classmate. He said, ‚ÄúWhy are we doing this?‚Äù. I smiled and shrugged, and said a phrase to start the conversation. He said ‚Äú‚Ä¶what?‚Äù - Like I was speaking some strange alien tongue üòÇ And he just kept asking ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù I kept telling him the meanings and he just replied to my phrases in English. I was almost in tears when we finished."
3912,isfp,i usually listen to how a song sounds rather than looking for good lyrics. sometimes i don't realize that a song i really like also has good lyrics/meaning til weeks later lol. but yeah when i do come across nice lyrics i enjoy them but i don't actively look or listen for it
3913,isfp,I like them for their aesthetic appeal (i.e. where the voice/certain phrases lends some unique taste to a song) but generally the interpretation of the lyrics doesn't really matter to me. More so the beat/melody of the song :) 
3914,isfp,"The people who just instantly say ""its not science so its automatically lies and bullshit"" dont actually take the time to look into the theory behind it which is really detailed and substantive. Nothing like a buzzfeed quiz.
Most humans dont know themselves as well as they think they do most humans lie about themselves to keep up the ideal version of themselves in their head. And thats why the scores are so liable to change. Based on your mood you could decide youre more one way than another if youre not really trying to be as objective about yourself as possible which most people arent.
Its not provable or testable but with the amount of anectdotal evidence it has in its corner you cant just dismiss it as nothing. 
It should only be used for personal self discovery though it should never be a deciding factor on who gets a job or not, that i agree with."
3915,isfp,The author is under the impression that mbti describes behavior when in fact it is used to describe how a person thinks and how their brain operates. Behavior will obviously change as you develop as a person. People with changing results lack the information needed to accurately type themselves. It takes a decent amount of work to be able to type yourself. Just a garbage article based on ignorance like most of the internet.
3916,isfp,"The MBTI, or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, is an instrument designed to assess how an person typically takes in, processes, and makes decisions about information from the world around them. Using a self-report questionnaire, the MBTI measures four psychological dimensions to sort people into 16 types, each with a unique profile of mental processes that drive an individual‚Äôs personality. MBTI type isn‚Äôt meant to predict behavior or label personality traits,however. Its purpose is to look under the surface and find the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. Used correctly, it can provide tremendously useful insight.
How Does It Work?
The core concept behind the MBTI is that we all have innate, individual differences in the ways our minds tend to perceive and utilize information ‚Äî cognitive functions ‚Äî which then influence the way we operate in the world. These differences are viewed as natural preferences, rather than absolutes, and none is considered superior to any other. Much like being left or right-handed, we have naturally dominant ‚Äúdefault‚Äù preferences that we tend to feel more comfortable with and use more often. These cognitive functions are like tools in your mental toolbox. You can use any of them as needed, but there are some you tend to reach for more than others, and those are the ones that feel most familiar. When we engage our non-dominant functions, it can begin to feel awkward, unnatural, or uncomfortable, often leading us to feel psychologically ‚Äúworn out‚Äù over time. The MBTI assesses these cognitive preferences across 4 separate dimensions, each of which is expressed as a dichotomy of two opposites: Extraversion vs. Introversion, Thinking vs. Feeling, Intuition vs. Sensing, and Judging vs. Perceiving. It is important to note that this terminology can be somewhat misleading, as the colloquial meanings are different from their technical definitions within the MBTI model."
3917,isfp,"My biggest problem as a person is that I tend to keep most of my emotions locked away. It's gotten a lot better as I have matured and today I am a very outgoing and polite person but I still keep my strong feelings locked away. I tend to lockup especially when I am tired/frustrated and needing a break from dealing with other people (typically a introvert thing I believe). I had experienced large amounts of sadness and depression in my past due to parental problems. I went to therapy years ago but I never got over my feelings untill my life (through time) got over them for me. I've though about seeing another therapist but my rationale‚Äã tells me that I myself would be the only person able to understand. Whenever bad things happen to me or people say things to me that make me hot headed, I feel like my mind punishes me by recalling bad memories and forcing their emotions back on my body. I'll try to cope with the nuances of the day and sometimes I can mellow out but sometimes I can't hold in my emotions enough and I erupt. I start not thinking before I speak and I generally don't like my demeanor. Am I fucked up? Do I need help? I don't know. All I know is that I love my mind but sometimes I wish it would shut up and let me live."
3918,isfp,"I used to. I used to have emotional outbursts. Usually anger, and it usually ended up exploding on someone who really didn't deserve the full wrath I unleashed. Sometime between high school and college I learned to let things out gradually and not bottle things up. The extreme outbursts caused so many problems and holding things in just made everything worse."
3919,isfp,"I also tend to live in my head and so things build up. I feel that it does help seeing someone, but not talk about your problems. You could try seeing someone to help you develope management stratagies, not to cope but to have a contructive way of letting your frustrations out before they get out of hand. Everyone is diffrent and there are many methods. And if you dont want to see someone, the net is full of info. 
Then also I find it helps having a healthy lifestyle. Its is my best way to let off frustration. "
3920,isfp,"What? Hide my emotions? I'm not hiding, you are! I'm perfectly fine!! /s
Well, in my experience, I also bottled it all up, so deep that now I can't even tell what I really feel anymore. That seemed like a good idea, but now I see it wasn't. I want to be free, I want to be able to feel, even if it is sadness, it is only healthy to feel this way in some situations.
Not even I can understand myself, so obviously no one else can do it better, not even a therapist. But! Going to therapy was the best decision I ever made in my life. It is not someone who will tell you 'oh this is wrong you need to do that' (at least mine is not), but a tool to help you navigate through life, have insights and understand yourself and others way better... really no downsides to it. "
3921,isfp,"Have you also experienced using them and making a shit out of yourself? How did you react? Was it worth it somehow?
Also how about your shadow functions? According to Beebe, for an ISFP, Fe as opposing function will manifest when the ego is hurting or if there is some kind of trauma that the ISFP is experiencing. Ne and Ti will manifest sometimes too, specially during the aftermath of a trauma."
3922,isfp,"For the ESTP (Se-Ti-Fe-Ni), the opposing function will be Si, the 7th and 8th will be Fi and Ne respectively. I haven‚Äôt really thought about it very much about ESTPs so comment will be unpolished, but when your Se is being negated or not allowed to flourish somehow you will dismiss all possibilities, will stick to what is tried and tested. I suspect that once subjected to the trauma for a long time you might stop seeking help at all as pain is now comforting and is known unlike the possibility of being okay and starting all over again from scratch. 
If this approach does not work, Fi and Ni will manifest as a last resort to save the dom. I suspect an ESTP might think that the trauma is something not to get rid of, but rather to be embraced as it is a part of his identity. Addictions that might follow as a response to the trauma might also be seen as a part of his identity perhaps (Along the lines of, ‚ÄúWell, I am an alcoholic! So what? It‚Äôs part of who I am, you just don‚Äôt understand.) An ESTP friend is like that. Still an alcoholic until now. Would post dank memes and funny posts about his addiction, seems to be really proud of himself being an alcoholic. The more people intervene, the more he resists. Ne will look into the future in the worst light, unlike Ni it will focus on a lot of paths in the future. Every possibility imagined is terrible and much worse than the current situation. Probably will say, ‚ÄúI am in pain, but I could be worse.‚Äù
EDIT: Ne instead of Ni"
3923,isfp,"I'm an INTJ and my boyfriend's sister (with whom he is very close) is an ISFP. I can't quite figure out how best to approach her. There's some history, kind of a comedy of errors really, of us just not being able to see eye to eye. My INFJ boyfriend tries to further things, but he can't do everything. His sister and I have a lot of similar interests; the outdoors, photography, and baking, but I've never been very good at striking up relationships. The ones I have I'm not sure how exactly they happened or why they keep happening. So, any advice on good methods of befriending, how you relate to INTJ's and can you elaborate on things they do that drive you crazy, hurt your feelings, or whatever else that makes it difficult to have a relationship with them would be much appreciated. "
3924,isfp,"I'm an INFJ female married to an ISFP male. I've learned that an ISFP requires very gentle and quiet compliments and encouragement, especially encouraging words. Something like ""I really appreciate what you're doing, I wish I could do that."", or ""You're so good at what you do."" This is like starting the boil of water in the pot before you put the pasta in so to speak. You have to start it up, let it simmer and then add the sauce. And never ever expect a verbal reply back that will make you feel acknowledged, an ISFP will reward your recognition in some other way and it will surprise you. But, it will be in their own time. I have found that an ISFP can be very generous with sharing special things to them, you have to wake that up the desire in them to share very slowly though. You can do it because INTJs like you are very patient."
3925,isfp,"I'm an INFP with an ISFP friend. I'd say that finding interests you can enjoy together will bring you closer more than talking about ideas. This is hard for me because as a fellow intuitive type, most of my close friendships are built on long, deep conversations. My ISFP is not ""deep"" in the way that I can relate well to for conversation, so we have a better connection with each other if we experience something together. We love to take long walks, look at people's gardens, etc. 
ISFPs have strong taste in things like music, art, food or whatever they are passionate about. If you can find common ground in these things and experience them together, that's another great bonding activity. 
As an INTJ you may come off to them as overly goal-oriented, overly rational, or overly regimented. These might spark insecurities or discomfort in an ISFP, who values a ""go with the flow"" mentality but may feel some inadequacy regarding it. What I have found is that I am always the one driving the train when it comes to making plans to get together. Don't take it personally. 
They also think with their feelings and how things fit with them, so they may be intimidated if you come off as too logical. The hard part about this is that they often take a very long time to understand what they feel and a longer time to express it. So if something requires a decision, give them a lot of time and space to think about it. For the most part, trying to walk them through it logically will just make them want to push you away. For instance, if you ask your bf's sister what she wants to do for a career, just show a lot of enthusiasm for her ideas and give her affirmation about what you think she would be good at. But don't suddenly start going ""Oh, you want to be a musician? Let me put you in touch with my musician friends tomorrow!"" You have to really ease into it. 
I don't know if this is just my friend, but I think my ISFP friend is kind of ""bad"" at communicating. I put ""bad"" in quotes because it's a judgement based on my values in communication. He is actually very perceptive about my mood, facial experiences, etc. And he is very in tune with the moment. But he is not good at reflecting on experiences/feelings, writing them out, or explaining them. I take great care to make my texts sound cheerful or to show empathy in my emails if we are talking about our personal lives. He'll just say things very bluntly. I used to read into it thinking he was in a bad mood or something, but I realized that he just doesn't ""hear himself"" in written words the way I do. When he writes back to an email or listens to me in conversation, he doesn't acknowledge what I say in a way that shows me that he cares. But I think it's just that ISFPs take a long time to process things, and combined with a disdain for saying something superficial, it keeps them from responding in a way that propels the conversation. "
3926,isfp,"This is some pretty insightful stuff.  I'm an INTJ with an ISFP friend, and I agree that it's easier for us to connect over activities and tactile sensations than abstract ideas.  My friend often comments on how goal-oriented, rational, and regimented I am, and I frequently am the one who has to make the concrete plans to get together, even if my friend vaguely expresses interest in getting together.  My friend takes a long time to ""feel things through"" (as opposed to what I'd do--thinking things through).  She's also kind of ""bad"" at communicating in the ways you've described.  It's kind of reaffirming to see a post like yours so closely mirror my experiences.  Thank you for sharing.  "
3927,isfp,"What types have my fellow ISFPs have formed successful (2+ years) relationships with? I feel so unique, complicated, and dysfunctional that sometimes I don't know who or what could ever work for a happy, healthy long-term love. 
I know there are a million variations within each mbti type, and in the end we're all individuals. With that disclaimer, I'm curious to hear whether other people's experiences can lend insight or guidance to my quest.
I tried an ESTJ, but he was too dominant and insensitive. (But he could be an exception. Thoughts?)
Tried ENFP twice, but in both cases the connection was lacking after the infatuation wore off. 
Dated a possible INFJ, felt a strong connection but our mutual struggle with anxiety and depression accumulated and poisoned the relationship. We were also very young and immature... I suspect INFJ could actually be a good match in healthier circumstances? 
With an INTJ, I felt a strong connection. He was a quiet one, and I liked that he was decisive without dominating, always stable and predictable. He had this beautiful logical computer-brain that would never start drama or read into something I said. Made me calm, eased anxiety. But he had very little social drive and required too much alone time. I felt lonely and neglected. But he loved me as deeply as any robot ever could, with that cold metal heart of his. 
So..... 
TL;DR   What ""type"" has worked for you?"
3928,isfp,"Dated an ENFP for nine months. They were very controlling and I'm really easily manipulated. Took me a super long time to realize I had to break up with them because I couldn't handle the bossiness and emotional control. They flipped their shit and it was really scary lol
Didn't bother testing my other partners for their mbti type.
I can totally see how dating an INTJ would be awesome in a lot of ways."
3929,isfp,"One of my ISFP best friends is married to an ESFJ and I think they're great for each other. Started dating in 2009 and married in 2012. They have two kids now and things are still good.
I have some mini-concept that some of the best relationships are where you share none of the same cognitive functions but the same kinds of functions in the same order (I'll explain this in the next paragraph). It works out in the ""labeling system"" of MBTI that you just keep the two middle letters the same and invert the first and last. So ISFP-ESFJ... ENFJ-INFP... ISTP-ESTJ... etc.
So in the cognitive functions that MBTI is based on, ISFPs will lead with Introverted feeling while ESFJs lead with extraverted feeling. The second function for both types, respectively, are extraverted sensing and introverted sensing. (I believe) that it works out that many times you end up very similar on the surface about many things for completely different reasons.
And based on my relationship with an INFJ (I'm an INFP), we appear very similar on the surface but how we internalize everything is completely different. We agree on many things but for completely different reasons, so it's interesting as long as we are secure in ourselves first and don't see differences as threats. So even if you had the kindred spirit of the ESFJ (an ISFJ) it might work out well as long as you're both able to get outside of yourselves."
3930,isfp,"Not with that attitude!  :p
Okay I know that was the most obnoxious thing I could possibly say, but it's true that something can only happen if you think it's possible and take steps in that direction. Of course then it's still not guaranteed, but at least you don't want to make a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. Of course, if you like being single, then I take back this entire comment XD"
3931,isfp,"I've heard this concept, and I think for most people it sounds right.... The weird thing is I always seem to befriend intuitive types rather than sensing types, and I even tested as an infp up until I was about 20. I'm all confuuuused XD"
3932,isfp,"I kinda think that can be even more meaningful since they're doing something intentionally instead of just what comes naturally.... But my INTJ didn't even try so it's nice that yours did :p  mine bought me a really nice Christmas gift, which I knew was a meaningful gesture since he was broke and hated spending money.... but in the end I would have preferred emotional support XD"
3933,isfp,"Ya, I was being a little extreme. I do hope to one day be in a good relationship, and am currently (hopefully) taking the right steps toward that. I do really enjoy being alone and by myself, so who knows"
3934,isfp,"I seem to befriend SPs and NTs more than NFs. SPs are my ""activity buddies/people to do stuff with"" and NTs are the people I like talking theoretical with because A) they don't get intimidated by abstract interests/we can keep up with each other in theoretical conversations & B) usually social pragmatics are not a focus so I don't feel emotionally exhausted by trying to maintain an emotional undercurrent with NTs.
I think my relationship with NFs is there's too much of a connection that, unless they're in my family [or are my S.O. in my case], it is a bit too emotionally intense for a casual relationship. Too deep, too authentic, too quick lol."
3935,isfp,"So I'm in a relationship right now with a guy (I think he's INTJ?) and although I'm super attracted to him and find him really fun to spend time with, for some reason when we can only communicate through texting or can't see each other for a lengthy period of time I start to get a little... confused? Upset, maybe?
Mostly it comes from me automatically assuming that he's thinking the worst about me if there's not that constant reassurance/word of affirmation. Even then, the effect those have doesn't last very long. I wonder if I just slip into a FiNi loop or something, where I come up with these unfounded hunches and automatically assume they're true. Like, if he doesn't say goodnight or doesn't respond with much enthusiasm (I guess, if I'm giving more than he's giving back) then it really messes with my head, and typically in person I keep my distance and stay reserved until I feel like he's earned my ""trust"" again. Which is so weird, I don't know.
Is this type of thinking in the early stages of a relationship normal? I wonder if ISFP's are the type least likely to thrive in a long-distance type relationship, since we tend to enjoy the physical presence of our partners and communicate affection in terms of actions rather than plain old texts that convey nothing of the sort."
3936,isfp,"INTJ here. I dated an ISFP for two years. I'm not much of a texter and it would freak him out and make him anxious when I forget to say goodnight or am more succinct with my texts‚ÄîI didn't realize it was affecting him that much until he vocalized it to me. 
I would just tell your INTJ that it bothers you. Make sure you explain your feelings clearly. Sometimes, we have a hard time understanding where people are coming from with their emotions but if you can explain it well, chances are that they will be understanding and will adjust accordingly. Just be honest and clear. "
3937,isfp,I‚Äôve been with my partner for almost 2 years and he‚Äôs quite a busy man. If I haven‚Äôt seen him physically for a full week (but still text everyday) I still get somewhat...I wouldn‚Äôt call it shy but I‚Äôm a little more reserved than I would normally be compared to being with him for a few days. I think it‚Äôs an ISFP thing now that you‚Äôve shed some light on this. I thought it was just me. 
3938,isfp,"ISFP here.
I did LD with an INTJ for a few years. It was extremely tough - and he was more balanced than most of them. It didn't work out in the end and he was very cold about it. More than that I would not recommend LD unless you really can't help it. I found the lack of 'real' contact to be a big thing and we Skyped 2-3 times a week to make up for it. It was still no comparison to being together irl which we were able to be once a month. You are astute enough to realise you have these needs, it is not down to you to quash them for him it is up to you to vocalise them and to reach an agreement between the two of you that makes you both happy. The question is if he is mature enough in his type to care. 
-NTJ's will not appreciate having to constantly re-earn your trust if they believe you are already close and you are not talking to them about what you need. That's not a good behaviour and something you should work on no matter who you are with, it's hard work and unnecessary. That's an emotional maturity thing as much as personality type. You're game playing when you do that even though you may not realize it. Imagine how annoying you'd find it if someone you were dating was hot/cold all the time. 
All in all while the LD/very different personality type leant itself to a lot of personal growth, in the end the S/N difference was not easy to ignore - for him who broke it off but also for me who understood why. "
3939,isfp,Tell him what you think. I'm dating an intj (Ldr) we have been texting each other nonstop for about 7 months and talk on the phone every day at least once. It sounds like you're just generally feeling insecure about the situation. Best thing to do is just tell them exactly what you're feeling and hope they understand. INTJs are known for being straight forward and direct with communication and liking th at in return. 
3940,isfp,"Im an isfp dating an intj long distance and we're one year strong. We do see eachother every few weeks tho. 
Idk man the jumping to conclusions thing is just something you have to be conscious of and learn to set aside/ take with a grain of salt. It helps to talk to him about it in a non confrontational way with the disclaimer that youre aware you tend to overthink a lot. If hes a good dude he should be understanding and you can ease your mind. But yea i used to be way worse about that type of thing and ive learned to take a few steps back when i feel paranoia taking hold."
3941,isfp,"Okay :) I always forget that it's important to communicate those feelings. But if it takes an adjustment for the desired level of emotional intensity to be maintained, does that mean that perhaps the relationship isn't the right one in the first place?"
3942,isfp,"Yes!! Shy is the absolute right word for it. I really think it comes down to the fact that texting the person is completely different than seeing them in person, like you lose the human aspect of it (which, I suppose, is fairly important for ISFPs). "
3943,isfp,"This post really helps. Thank you...
I'm in a bit more of a fortunate situation than yours, I get to see him at the very minimum once a week. And I guess I have been communicating my needs more to him now, but I hate stressing him out when I do. He has my trust... it's more so the medium of text that doesn't really allow for us to be as expressive as we'd like and leads to all the misunderstanding (opposing role Fe lol). But I would like to think that the relationship is still possible.
Regardless, it's really nice to know that you felt you grew a lot personally through your relationship. That's what matters!"
3944,isfp,"Not necessarily. The one thing I loved about my ISFP was that he was a steady person and weathered with me through my emotional turmoil.
However, we broke up because we were just not growing individually as a couple. Also because I realized that, for myself, I wanted someone who could share that emotional and mental depth and intimacy with, and someone who could challenge me. It was just something I knew I wanted. "
3945,isfp,"So it looks like you've gotten a lot of good advice on here so far. I guess this is an aspect of the ISFP x INTJ relations. I echo what others have said. I dated one INTJ and I am 'friendly' with another. In the first scenario there were 4 month of the year that we were long distance and this was when I felt really distant from them. It felt awkward to skype/talk on the phone. Texting was a little better with this one as he was more consistent, but still..when we finally reunite it felt like we an awkward reset. Like we had to learn again why were together, like the connection wasn't so obvious and I had to warm up to them again. This was a very strange feeling and it always felt like something wasn't right. It got to the point one summer where we were skyping and had nothing to say to each other despite not having talked for a week or two (of course stuff was going on in our lives...but we weren't sharing). We broke up a few weeks after that. I always felt like they weren't expressing themselves to me. I wanted more emotion, I was sick of guessing how they felt.
The second INTJ, they live a few hours away and I only see them 2-3x a year. Once again, every time I see them there is this awkward reset. Like I don't know where I stand with him because he's so hidden at expression. It's bizarre. I'd really like to fix it but since we are 'friends' and not dating I can't place those expectations on him. It doesn't help that he is very distant with texting and we'll go weeks without talking to each other. He doesn't know it but in those instances I am secretly mad at him - but true to my ISFPness I stifle it in order to keep my cool. Well, I did get mad at him once and he apologized (he went MIA for 6+ months) but it was basically communicated to me that he wouldn't be able to meet my expectations."
3946,isfp,"This. All of this. And i don't know what to do about it, because you can't really force them to change their lack of emotional expression and everything and getting mad at them when they don't just isn't fair. I don't know. I don't want it to end and I hope that isn't how it has to be."
3947,isfp,"I guess one general example would be that I could never talk to him about the nuances and specifics of all the things important to me‚Äîfaith, politics, the academia, culture, etc.
We had a lot in common but we didn't share depth in them. 
Even in life choices, I was always pushing myself and taking risks in different endeavors‚Äîboth personal and work-related. But he was comfortable working part-time jobs after college, and not looking for a career. 
Thus, I always felt like I was moving forward because I was always eager to learn. But he was content with where he was, and it eventually caused a strain in us. It felt like we were growing apart as time went on. 
I realized that emotional and mental depth was what I needed when I had met an ENFx after him, and found myself so attracted to our connection and conversations. Things didn't work out but I knew then that I was looking for that depth this whole time."
3948,isfp,"All I can share is that if they are consistent at communicating - they are committed. I know it's easy to bottle things up but try communicating your thoughts more. Or try translating your feelings into facts. For example, I responded once to INTJ friend and they didn't respond. My response was kind of vague and passive,  but from my end it was an invitation to further go on. I thought they were being careless when they didn't write back. Then I wrote to them a few days later in a more direct way and they were more than on board. It's like they cannot read between the lines but we are all about being understood via metaphors. It's misunderstandings galore. Being direct doesn't feel as romantic to me but I think if this is the type of partner you have, it's something you'll have to bend on in order to get the feedback you're looking for.
Also I'd like to add that I don't think words of affirmation is the things ISFP need most, but physical affection - which is seriously lacking in LD relationships. I think that's a major factor in how ISFP and INTJ connect - their physicality."
3949,isfp,This is a little sad for me to read as I have experienced this as an ISFP. I really want to connect with INTJ but there seems to be a block. Like we like to talk about the same things but in different ways. 
3950,isfp,"That's very interesting... and kind of ironic, since you would think the N/S divide would have them wanting to be understood via metaphors and us wanting to be spoken to more directly. I wouldn't mind translating my feelings more so into facts for him - it's just kind of a strange thing to do. In person you can use more body language and get the message across a lot easier, but over text I suppose that's the best thing we can do. 
He is very consistent with communicating, and has been for quite a while. I just fear that at some point that commitment will go away for one reason or another, whether because he gets tired of the texting or my more reserved nature or whatnot. At this point I'm able to accept that I really want to be with him despite how strained our texting might be (and compromise accordingly), as spending time in person with him more than makes up for it. But it also sucks that I can't really have with him the sorts of conversations I'm having with you guys on here too. It's a strange situation... but thank you so much for sharing what you think :)"
3951,isfp,"I definitely think it's something you guys can work through. That's not necessarily a ""deal breaker."" 
For me, I just knew what I wanted. Your INTJ might be different. 
My only advice regarding that is find ways to go deep. INTJs enjoy theorizing and talking about possibilities. We're a pragmatic and grounded kind but also idealistic. A lot of my core beliefs reflect that, which drive my relationships. "
3952,isfp,"Is there an end game to the long distance? It helps to have an eventual plan to be with each other on a more permanent basis in the future. 
And yes, it's kinda sad when I think about it. I can't be so carefree and silly with them..I wish I could connect with them that way, but I definitely think that's due to the N/S divide."
3953,isfp,"I find this post really weird. Most people I know who are into psychological preferences are considerate, self-aware, analytical types, who are looking to find out more about themselves.
But this comes across as an angry rant from someone who might be lacking a bit of self-awareness, and who doesn't seem considerate of others at all.
If you're getting told not to be rude, it's probably because you're being rude. Whether or not you don't believe in right or wrong, the fact is that society does, and you have to either adjust your views or get used to being called out. That's nothing to do with so-called ""social justice"", just etiquette. 
And, if you do truly believe there's no right or wrong (I don't imagine that's actually the case, if you dig a bit), and you're advocating entirely free, uncensored speech, it's rather hypocritical to get angry when someone says something you don't like. "
3954,isfp,"I would say that I agree, although just a couple of questions...
1) What do you mean by ""no right or wrong?"" 
2) Why are you suspecting INFP? They have a dominant Fi just like you, so wouldn't they fuss just about things that really matter to them? Wouldn't an Fe user be more likely, since they get are more likely to look to societal standards for morality? Why have you narrowed in on INFP/J?
I do agree with you, people need to stop looking to be provoked, because it is pathetic, but where is all the anger coming from?"
3955,isfp,"I hate moralists. And INFP's are a great example of people that cant avoid being just that. Shit yeah they might have Fi but their intuitiveness makes them appear as nothing else matters to them and that its only their beliefs that are correct. I see this in EVERY INFP IVE EVER MET, and it pisses me the fuck off everytime i witness it."
3956,isfp,"I hate SJWs. There I fixed it for you and left MBTI out of it because, well, it has nothing to do with it. In fact, it's possible you've picked out traits you don't like from certain people and assigned a single misused title to anyone with those traits."
3957,isfp,"I believe in morality and doing the ""right thing"", but I never feel like I have to shove it down everyone's thoats.  I certainly don't think that passive aggressively telling someone to be more politically correct is something that should be considered politically correct.  I don't typically get angry about SJWs, but I do think that it's a bad trend that is occurring . "
3958,isfp,"I'm an INFP and I don't like ""SJWs"" either (And I mean those crazy, delusional ""I have 49434 genders and if you don't acknowledge that you're literally a racist transphobic bigot and I will dox you for ever daring to say that"", not people who actually care for social justice).
Maybe you did come off as slightly rude at some point? But I disgress, I actually agree that SJWs are annoying and irritating. I think they are the best examples of what an unhealthy INFP or INFJ looks like. As for me, just don't mess up with my internal values (or my friends) and I'll be chill."
3959,isfp,"Look, I see what you are saying. I'd imagine you believe in the opposite of what I do and that's why you say the things you say.
How do I lack self awareness? Lol. And yes I'll admit I am extremely selfish unless it is for the people I love. This is just my version of Fi.( I don't care if yours is all empathetic, if you are ISFP I highly doubt it anyways.)
No, I don't have to adjust myself to society I'm not a sheep to society unlike Fe's are.
Just for the record the US is known for not having manners and for the people to just not give a fuck and go wild lol. Especially young people in their early 20s like me.
You can call social justice whatever you wanna call it. Things like these are typically called SJW stunts.
Right and Wrong is a human construct, there is no such thing. 
Yes I am a hypocrite but I've accepted he fact that my Fi is very selfish and things only apply to me and the people I love/friends. I am not empathetic rather sympathetic, I cannot feel what others are feeling. I can only see myself in them. 
Also.
I'm not  ""getting angry because they said something I don't like"".
I'm angry because they are imposing their morals on me. "
3960,isfp,"Well look, at first I thought it might be INFJ(Fe) too. But that just doesn't make sense. I think most INFJ's are mistyped INFP's too.
Because of you ever seen Fe in real life, or Internet  how ENFJ's/ESFJ'a communicate  you'd discover that Fe( healthy Fe) actually approaches the problems in a polite manner with the intent on making others get along.
This is not the case for most SJW's. They react in angry tone and gets all sensitive and defensive. This is the the example of an Fi-Ne and Ne-Fi.
Fe users typically don't act this way.
The Ne in their function stacks makes them very empathic which is why they may appear so different. 
Most ISFP's are only sympathetic.
On a pure logical standpoint, right or wrong does not exist.
Btw my dad is an Fe Dom so I know what I'm talking about."
3961,isfp,"From my experience INFP's have been the most sensitive people on the Internet/real life and I believe they are notorious for this trait  among the MBTI community and even their own.
.
That's how I came to my conclusion.
FYI if you don't know the whole basis and idea of SJW's are  based off over sensitive people.
.
Thanks for your post"
3962,isfp,"Why don't you do that in the ""not-real life"" of the internet. Believe it or not there are real people living real-lives behind the screen.
I am no fan of SJWs either. But at the same time am not a fan of people being dicks or rude."
3963,isfp,Logic works for me the same as it does for everyone else and it's clear from your post you lack.  Wtf are stuck up morals btw could you define that?  It seems to me you're the one being stuck up since you're ranting based purely on your own feelings and not considering anything else.  And you have your own morals and your own sense of right or wrong.  I don't have any problem with that but you can't say you believe in Fi things and then right after it say you have no morals or sense of right or wrong.  What the hell are anti-stuck up morals?
3964,isfp,">Just for the record the US is known for not having manners and for the people to just not give a fuck and go wild lol. Especially young people in their early 20s like me.
lolwat? Yeah, no. I can't take anything you say seriously after that, sorry. I'm not normally one to call troll, but...you're setting off my troll sensor. And I normally believe the best in people until the end."
3965,isfp,"You are trying to say that, I'm not considering that fact that I have my own morals? Therefore I am a hypocrite?
Yes, I have my morals too but most of the time unless it is something really personal ( only few things in life that are) I don't get butt hurt. 
I'm a realist man....... It is what it is, and whatever I say isn't going to change somebody's mind. Further more like I said before ""there is no such thing as right or wrong"" so my only excuse for standing up for  what I believe in is simply because ""I believe it"". 
The problem with SJW's is they get into other people's business and violate their freedom of speech/literal freedoms. They start making arguments and getting butt hurt because you said/ did something they didn't like. 
I don't give a fuck about anything unless it directly affects me or my loved ones/friends. I let people be free and do whatever the fuck they want to do in life.
Unlike SJW's they want to call them out and harass them because that's their only ""out"" from their butthurt.
What is ""Fi things""?
quote for quote ""Fi beliefs"" in the OP could be anything. 
I don't believe that right and wrong exist. This is simply according to logic itself and even though I am Fi Dom I cannot deny logic itself.
Right and wrong is an human construct it simply does not exist."
3966,isfp,"Have you seen all the party movies and shit and the media?? Every society is polite to an extent. If you compare the US  to the more formal European/Asian countries you'd find that the US has little regard to manners and shit. 
Anyways I don't care about what you think lol.
EDIT: plus if I wanted to be a troll I'd post this in INFP forums. ( I'm obviously not a troll)
ISFP's like me generally don't give a fuck unless SJW INFP's start imposing their sensitive cry baby shit on me."
3967,isfp,"First of all I can't stand SJW's either.  Second, because right and wrong is not objective and is a concept doesn't mean that it isn't useful.  Society only functions because we have rules and we agree on a certain moral and ethical code.  Those who choose not to follow the ""rules"" have to pay the penalty if they choose to live in society.  Otherwise it would cease to function.  Society is an ancient construct and I would argue a necessity for civilization.  I understand that this requires compromise by individuals and can be a major downside to living in society but what's the alternative?  There is a reason societies evolved and it has a lot to do with human survival.  "
3968,isfp,"What do you think about nerdy/dorky people? I'm ISTP I think, but I act a bit more like xNTP due to social anxiety... do you find people who can talk about random knowledge for days annoying? It's hard to tell when y'all just stand there listening and then just say ""cool""..."
3969,isfp,"Im considered nerd/dork by many people. I dont see why it is linked to certain personality types. I enjoy knowledge. Not always, yes I have to be in the mood for it. So it really depends on many factors and not just personality type. But I will say I do just say ""cool"" when discussing things sometimes, but thats because I would rather avoid confrontations and not because its about things above my 'nerdiness'. "
3970,isfp,"I think most people get a little bored with a one-sided conversation, where one person is talking about their interests or personal life for days and the other person doesn't have anything to contribute. It all depends on whether your interests are interesting to them, and that varies by the individual (not just mbti). 
But nerdy/dorky isn't necessarily bad, I love hanging out with nerds because they're not afraid to be different, and it helps me be my weird self.
Could be helpful to try to engage the other person more, pay attention to them and find out what they're interested in (not in a stalker way though). Although many ISFP don't want to talk much even about their own interests. Sometimes I greatly prefer to let other people talk, it's much easier for me. But if I'm interested, I'll usually say more than just ""Cool."""
3971,isfp,"I‚Äôm a huge nerd/dork (I‚Äôm reminded often), and it all depends on the subject. Talking about computers and tv shows I can go in for days, but talk about cars, politics or sports, I‚Äôm lost. I don‚Äôt know what to say in those situations. Sometimes it is interesting learning something new, but since I don‚Äôt have any more background knowledge, I can‚Äôt talk much about it. 
And also when someone is talking a lot, I find it hard to interject my own thoughts or say I‚Äôm not interested because I don‚Äôt want to seem rude by interrupting them"
3972,isfp,"Just discovered my ""type"" and, although I never put much stock into these personality things, I can't believe how well this describes me. Hadn't been on reddit in awhile but found you guys while googling.
I was wondering about adventuring ISFPs. After studying abroad many places in college, and doing well in school despite my crazy procrastination, I couldn't commit to a real job after graduating and decided to solo backpack central america. 
I loved the independence of it, and also how I could learn so many new ways of living from so many different people. I loved how I never really had to plan, that I would just wake up and decide which city to go to or to stay where I was. 
Finally finished and settled down to work at a field station in a tropical rainforest. I love how each day is different and the environment around me is incredibly beautiful and hands-on; the mud, the rain, the bug bites, and bruises make everything very real. 
To me, this job makes perfect sense with an ISFP- there's beauty and unpredictability, my work environment revolves around teamwork and harmony, not competition or advancement, only commit to 4 month projects. 
Wondering if there are more ISFPs out there who find that working outdoors or traveling is what makes them happiest. "
3973,isfp,"I absolutely love traveling, it's one of the most amazing things to for me. I'm more of an urban traveler (I like to visit different cities) but being out in nature is quite refreshing as well. 
I've always wanted to be a nomad of some sort. "
3974,isfp,"I love traveling but it's important to me to have a home base to feel safe. I work in aviation and am often traveling for weeks at a time and every project I work on is different. I also enjoy the hands on aspect of my work - helping with repairs, fueling and other bush activities. I used to travel more for pleasure but because my job is so active, I like to recharge at home or go on sun vacations. "
3975,isfp,"I'm an ISFP (almost needless to say? hehe) but I'm certainly not a healthy one! There are some aspects in which I seem super healthy, but in the rest, I'm super unhealthy. There is just no middle ground. 
I've been wondering if there are reliable, detailed books or other reading material that'll help me make myself a better person and understand myself in general, at the last. Can you guys help me out? Cheers!
I face issues in these aspects (and more):

sustaining and committing to my work
being empathetic and perceptive of others
anything romantic (!)
mood swings especially when in a social setting
getting past my past (I let things loop infinitely)
learning from mistakes: I tend to repeat my faulty behaviour even when I consciously know it's the wrong thing
being productive on a daily basis, as in, sustaining and committing to a routine over longer times

Thanks a ton in advance, just in case I'm unable to personally thank you in the comments!"
3976,isfp,"Aren't some of the things on your list ISFP super-powers?  Committing to routine isn't necessarily a trait of a healthy person, but fully living in the moment is a gift that not everybody has, why not own and embrace it?  If it's daily tasks like chores or work, maybe see the nuances of said tasks and realize that every day is a new day and doing the dishes isn't the same as washing cups.
Self identify instead of self construct, just be yourself in a way that's beneficial to you :)"
3977,isfp,"Here are the 2 books that helped me a lot with some of the issues you mentioned that I myself struggled with.


The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals by Chris McChesney, Jim Huling, and Sean Covey


The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey

"
3978,isfp,"Try reading Think on These Things by Krishnamurti. He talks a lot about the things in your list, and also about keeping things in perspective and being present. 
Also, just remember, doing these things is more important than reading about them. You can know what you need to do, but just knowing solutions won‚Äôt help you take a step toward a healthier life. "
3979,isfp,"So since we're supposed to be the cool kids who have awesome taste in music, and this sub seems to be pretty quiet, I thought each month maybe we could have a thread where everyone contributes to new music/music they've just discovered to share.

3981,isfp,"Lucky Boys Confusion just came out with their first new album in many years. I have only listened to two songs so far, and I don't think they were their best work, but certainly good enough to get me excited for the rest of the album, which I'll likely listen to on my way home from work.
Other than that, I've actually been listening to a lot of music from the '90s and '00s lately. Not sure why. Guess I've just been feeling nostalgic."
3982,isfp,"Yes!!! My recommendations are, Paprika, tokyo godfathers, chico and rita, wrinkles, millennium actress, the triplets of belleville, waking life, and steam boy off the top of my head. They are all very different but all very good."

Or listening to Coltrane without thinking too heavily about The Sound of Music."
3985,isfp,"First off I want to say, I know I've been posting a lot so if I get annoying please tell me to slow it down a bit. 
Anyways, 
I wanted to know what you all thought about graveyards. I really enjoy walking through them and find them to be very pleasant and I find great pleasure in looking at graves and thinking about the people that they are in memory of. A place that a lot of people find to be sad or spooky I find to be peaceful and enjoyable. 
For instance my first date with my now girlfriend was to a historical site near where we study. Along the main street there is an old church that has been running since the 1700's and a graveyard surrounds it. During our date I took her and walked around it for half an hour just looking the graves and musing about what the people were like and what they had seen as well as the history involved in it. I say we, but it was probably just me. (I'm still trying to get to know how her brain works.) 
So does what do you all think? Do you like Graveyards or is this a side of me that most ISFP's can't relate? "
3986,isfp,"I love them too actually. One of my favourites is a really creepy old one about a half hour outside of my city. It even has those gnarled old trees that are often seen in Halloween themed art. Going out there in the fall is so amazing and it just looks beautiful :)
Edit: Oh and I can totally relate to loving sad dark things. I definitely find that stuff very peaceful like you. "
3987,isfp,"Eh... They don't hold any sort appeal for me, really. Death freaks me out and while I don't actively avoid graveyards, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit one. Every so often the idea of what death is creeps into my head and I don't want or need to go somewhere that would only trigger such thoughts."
3988,isfp,"I don't really particularly like graveyards.  Maybe its because I've only been in ones that have people I knew buried there?  I've come to associate it with sad memories of funerals...I remember having to pick up my grandfather's bones after cremation, which really bothered me as a kid.  I guess death just freaks me out in general."
3989,isfp,I've been a fan of FindAGrave since I was about 9 years old (turning 16 in two months). Those grave sites are pretty neat. Their Facebook page recently posted a photo of a motorcycle-themed grave. It was awesome.
3990,isfp,"ENTP dropping by :D
I really like graveyards. The ones i know are the first thing you would associate with peace. Its so wonderfully quite. The Trees are standing still or lightly swishing in the wind. you see all the flowers on the graves while walking down a  way of earth so smove you dont hear the steps. You have banks at which you can rest, imagine your loved ones to sit next to you, maybe your grandfather with his walking stick? Noone judges you, noone complains, just concerted memory of good times together. Noone visits to say bad things. noone visits to complain, only to care and remember to stand there thinking of better times and to revive the most beautiful of all thoughts."
3991,isfp,"I tend to find graveyards as places of relaxation, reflection, and motivation.
Relaxation: They're usually still, quiet places. Nobody seems to mind if I go for a walk or read a book under a tree. They're pretty clean, too, which is really nice. I feel bad when I see people littering in graveyards, though. Thankfully, I don't see that happen too often.
Reflection: Again, quiet places where you can be left alone for hours on end. That seems like a pretty good thinking environment for me.
Motivation: I suppose its morbid, but graveyards motivate me to make the most of my life. I suppose that having a reminder that my time is limited fills me with a drive to live my life to the fullest."
3992,isfp,"Yep I'm very attracted to graveyards. I'm also quite interested in paranormal stuff so that might be why. I'm just interest in all taboo subjects really. But yes I love looking at gravestones a lot, especially really old ones. 
I have a favorite graveyard. It's in Concord, MA. If you are near there sometime, go. Because Thoreau and Emerson are buried there and people leave pens and paper and other tokens for them at their stones :) it's so cool. But besides that, the land is straight out of a fairytale. It's hilly and mossy and the graves meld into the land. It's the perfect place for an ISFP. "
3993,isfp,They are sad for sure. I can understand that. It's a reminder to us that life on this earth is not forever. But I think that it can also be a reminder that we only have so much time on this earth and that we should live our lives in a way that we can't be ashamed of and have to regrets. We can learn from our failures to make sure that we no longer make those mistakes and be happy about the lessons that we have learned. Don't you think?
3994,isfp,"I suppose I could understand that.  I personally am a Christian and because of my faith, I don't see death as thing to be feared as much as a sign that we live in an imperfect world that will one day be renewed into a place that will no longer be subject to the grave but that of which is life everlasting. 
If I didn't hold to that world view I imagine anything to do with death would freak me out too. "

3997,isfp,"I think my niche genre is likely post rock. So many bands are purely instrumental and create such emotionally overwhelming music...I have always cared 10x more about music over lyrics, and post rock shows how much emotion can be conveyed without needing to ""say"" anything."
3998,isfp,"So I've always been very open with my music taste especially over the past 2-3 years. I pretty much like Anytype of Rock/Metal (so many weird sub-genres so just gonna stick with writing these 2 xD) Hip-Hop, Grime, Kpop, Industrial. pretty much anything.
 I'm going to list some of my favourites/things i'm really digging right now:
XXXTentacion - Legit my favourite artist right now.
Death Grips - From the moment I heard Guillotine about a year and a half ago I fell in love.
K.Flay - very recently discovered her. Great flow, great lyrics.
Nine Inch Nails - I dont think I have to say much, If you havent listened to them I highly recommend them
Deftones, Die Antwoord, Giggs, Babymetal. "
3999,isfp,"I have interests in almost everything musically (only things I can't do are modern country, death metal, and most rap). I gravitate more toward the heavy side of rock, but not too heavy. Lately, I've been on a kick with a couple more electronically produced rock acts from the same label.
More specifically, I've been listening to a lot of Blue Stahli, Celldweller, Circle of Dust (sci-fi industrial), and Scandroid (cyberpunk 80s synthwave) lately."

4002,isfp,"My music taste is all over the place but in general I'd say pop and rock. I love oldies and classic rock. I know people look down upon post-grunge type stuff but I really do like it, even though it's generic as hell. Breaking Benjamin is one of my favorites. Early Lady Gaga, the Police, Hall & Oates, Michael Jackson, Michael Buble, Daft Punk, and Britney Spears are great too."
4003,isfp,"I listen to a wide variety of music, when people ask me what my favorite band or genre or song is, I can never narrow it down. It changes by the day or the week. But it usually is Green Day or Metallica, sometimes it's The Head and the Heart. I like having iHeart radio on shuffle and hearing new stuff in different generes though.. like I said.. it always changes haha"
4004,isfp,"haha listing shit is hard
some artists/bands i like right now: kanye west (x1000), meshuggah, nine inch nails, young thug, travis scott, chief keef, carly rae jepsen, kero kero bonito, korn, death grips, agoraphobic nosebleed, deafheaven, clipping, actually yknow what fuck this here's everything"
4005,isfp,"I would say Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron
Hard to say how it shaped my personality, but it was always my favorite movie throughout my childhood. I even had the computer game!"
4006,isfp,"First off ISFP probably won‚Äôt approach you. No matter how intriguing/beautiful/sexy you are. You will likely have to make the first move.
To answer your question about what types the ISFP is attracted to, it varies (like I see more variation with ISFPs choosing romantic partners than any other type) and I think mostly because ISFPs are content with solitude and only open up to someone who really offers something we‚Äôre needing at the time.
For that reason I tend to be attracted to people who are strong in the areas where I am very weak (so xNTJs, ISTJs, etc.) although many ISFPs I see on here (esp males) tend to migrate toward people who allow them to feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù expressing themselves and their feelings authentically (ExFJs, INFJs, etc.)
The best thing you have going for you is that INFP is probably the type we resemble most so you are already entering the situation with a deep understanding and empathy for ISFP weaknesses and feelings, which gets you past like three stages of the ‚Äúgetting to know ISFP‚Äù process that would normally be potential for a door slam.
Be yourself. That‚Äôs ultimately what I find the most attractive in a person, period. If I get even the slightest whiff of fakeness, superficiality, or an attempt to manipulate me I get unreasonably annoyed.
Also do not insult or ignore, but I don‚Äôt really see INFP doing that anyway. If you reciprocate the ISFP affection equally or slightly greater than that they‚Äôve shown you (not too much though, don‚Äôt want to seem needy) and they are even remotely interested, you should be on your way to a beautiful thing."
4007,isfp,"I have listed and described some things in detail before. Feel free to look at it. https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/ap8na3/how_do_you_become_friends_with_an_isfp/
Personally for me, I find that I like to surround myself with mindful people who are genuine, seem friendly, positive and nice. Someone who is very easy to talk to and get along with, who treats everyone with the same respect and sentiment. Mainly people who have or may share similar qualities or emotions to my own. They are the kinds of people who I feel I can trust not to feel harmful or toxic of being around and are more comfortable being with. On the other hand, people that I tend to stay away from are the ones who would seem to take advantage of me, are negative and controlling, self entitled or bossy, openly judgmental and not aware of others feelings or their actions, are fake and insensitively gossip a lot of false nonsense towards things or others. Being around those types of people makes me very uncomfortable and sensitive. For those reasons, I tend not to associate myself with those kinds of people. (will immediately close the door to anyone who is like this relationships wise)
Though I find that it's much easier to connect with others if we both have similar interests and views. These are just some helpful insights that I can help fill you in on. Some ISFPs may find themselves not worthy enough to be with others, but if you are already showing keen interests in them, that's a good thing. They want people who like them and notice them for who they are individually. Also, they may in turn will do the same if they find that you are a good person or influence to be around. =)  It usually takes a long time to get close to us, but when you do, you will  see just how strong of a bond we can form with another person. Also, we'll freely let you in on our secret world where all our passion, commitment, creativity,  loyalty, compassion, empathy and depth of love that people normally don't openly get to see or know about will be shown. Everything about our life of wonder, peace, fun, and purpose will be shared too. Basically we will reveal to you our real selves.  And if you ever get to that place, you will be considered a very special person in their eyes.

4008,isfp,"We don‚Äôt look for anything in a person. As soon as someone comes up to us, we decide if we like them or not.
If you want to be amenable to us, just live life. I‚Äôm drawn to Europeans. They don‚Äôt give a shit about anything but the finer things in life. Sitting on a patio, smoking a cigarette, enjoying the soft breeze... soft music playing in the background in a beautiful narrow artistic alleyway. Caf√© life. The baguette is around the corner.
Bottom line... you can‚Äôt fake it with true ISFPs. We know what we want. But we can‚Äôt describe it. 
Kinda like Am√©lie."
4009,isfp,"Someone understanding, genuine, kind, and funny - I have a bit of a strange sense of humor, so if they can appreciate it I always like spending time with them. Acting fake or trying to be too nice can seem weird though, like there needs to be a little bit of playful teasing for me, even in a platonic relationship. 
I'm talking to a girl right now and it seems like we get along pretty well. She's really kind, but still playful and teases me without going overboard. We also understand each other when we're messing around, and a lot of what she says just makes me laugh. She also seems very empathetic towards me which is kind of rare in my experience. It may be that I'm a tall, muscular guy, people don't assume I have many feelings, but it feels good to be able to talk to someone about them. She also contacted me first - I'm not really the type of guy to contact people unsolicited, unfortunately for my dating life :P"
4010,isfp,"Oh yeah, and French women are sexy. They exude art, and a carefree lifestyle full of carelessness, but still have the confidence that we lack. If you are a woman who is trying to get an ISFP, study women like Marion Cotillard and Melanie Laurent:"
4011,isfp,"The look of most surreal art stresses me out to be honest, lol. It's not the fact that it's surreal, it's just most pieces have some air that I don't like. Though, I do love it a lot if it has a softer look, maybe with some bright colours. 
I like this but not this."
4012,isfp,"I‚Äôm actually more into realism, unlike other commenters. Surrealism doesn‚Äôt always ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù to me. I value photo-realistic art pieces, the more skillfully executed - the better. Surrealistic pieces that feel ‚Äúreal‚Äù anyway are rare, but these are super cool too. "
4013,isfp,"I love both surrealism and realism, each for different reasons. Surrealism is the art of metaphor, one that can be unrealistic because it sets out to portray dreams and feelings in their most intensive raw forms, which I like a lot!
I enjoy realism because it is the art of effectively portraying things as accurately as possible, every fine line helps to build up the composition as a whole to make it a meaningful labour of love."
4014,isfp,"I tend to dislike surrealism. As ThreeBlackSevens said, it stressed me out. It gives me that vague sense of nausea. I like abstract paintings though, so it doesn't necessarily has to be realistic. I also like impressionism for example. Still ""real"" subject but playing with colours to evoque different sensations and emotions. One of my favourite realist painters is Bouguereau which is able to make me ""feel"" the materialism of the bodies, touches and...let's say anatomy."
4015,isfp,"lol creation has always come pretty naturally to me... every time I try to draw something that actually exists I mess it up... also saying it's a logical assessment and then saying we have different views is the equivalent of calling me illogical... in imo it depends on the artist, for some creation will be the easiest and for some replicating will be the easiest."
4016,isfp,"I have a procrastination problem and I wonder if it is related to type or not. Basically, if I start doing something, I get really into it and don't want to stop (including boring things like office admin stuff) but it's hard to get myself to start things (even things I enjoy like art or going for a walk or something). I'll do whatever I can to avoid starting, but once I start I'm fine. Does anybody else have this issue? If so how did you resolve it?"
4017,isfp,"As an ISFP I absolutely experience this. Sometimes I attribute it to me being too scared of starting something because I'm already concerned that it won't be just the right thing, the right way, that I want it done. So, I get into this cycle of putting it off until it absolutely HAS to happen and then I take the plunge and just go, go, go. Also ADD."
4018,isfp,"No MBTI type is immune to procrastination. I have ISTJ peers who are just as lazy as I am about homework, and I'm in my senior year of university.
The way I get myself out of those kinds of situations is to constantly visualize myself achieving the end-goal of what I'm doing."
4019,isfp,"Yeaaa...I almost flunked out of high school because I procrastinated doing my homework. I did online school and let all my assignments pile up to the last few weeks. My motivation was getting new musical equipment from my parents as a grad present. But I do sometimes procrastinate my music too. The only way I can get past it is picturing myself on the main-stage of a music festival. so, very similar to what /u/CKNW98 said. That pretty much gets me goin every time."
4020,isfp,"Right, exactly. I'm in the middle of this French poetry paper right now and slowing working through it, because I have 5 other papers I need to complete before Tuesday. Grad school, man. The ultimate procrastination.  "
4021,isfp,"I have an ISFP friend that never texts me first, but always responds to my messages and agrees to hang out with me. We've gone to the movies together, been ice skating, gone out for bubble tea, and so on. He seems to enjoy my company, but I feel as if the friendship is often a bit one-sided, considering I'm always the one texting him and recommending what we do. As an INFP, I can understand a lack of interest in texting, but if I consider someone a friend, I will always try to keep in touch with them and text them every so often, which includes asking them to hang out with me or just sending them a song or an article I like. I understand the need for space and always try to gauge the comfort levels of my friends. However, it's nice to have someone acknowledge you first sometimes, even though I try not to always expect it. Even if it was once or twice a month I would be happy. He is also originally a friend of my sister, so that makes me question if he sees hanging out with me as an obligation, which would explain why he always waits for me to text him. What do you guys think? Is this a normal ISFP habit or does it say something more?"
4022,isfp,"Sometimes texting means a conversation or even just communication I'm not in the headspace for.  It's still time and energy, even when I like someone a lot.  Also, people, however important to me, are never at the forefront of my mind unless something's really got my heartstrings.  To that end, I'm aware of my shortcomings as a friend, I'm probably not going to change, and I'm very grateful for the people who make the effort to keep me in their lives."
4023,isfp,honestly most times I forget about texting and leave people on read unconsciously because I truly forget I don‚Äôt think texting first can determine how much a person likes you honestly as long as we‚Äôre willing to spend time with you it means isfps would like you. at least from my personal experience if I decline meeting up that‚Äôs a sign I don‚Äôt really care about the person but everyone is different so just ask your friend next time! good luck
4024,isfp,"this is definitely something that I do and it also drove my INFP friend kinda nuts until we talked about it and I explained why I‚Äôm so bad at texting in general (forgetfulness, distractions, etc) 
So yeah, talk to your friend. Don‚Äôt be confrontational or accusatory about it, but don‚Äôt let it slide under the rug if it really bothers you"
4025,isfp,"Honestly I just fucking hate phones in general. I only have the blasted thing so I can make the two phone calls a month I want to make. I always respond because I don't want people to think I hate them. I wish they would just fucking call me though. I realize texting takes a minute, but it feels like such a laborious task to me. You can never adequately convey emotion through text."
4026,isfp,Honestly I‚Äôm not a big texter. That simple. My friends know that and are okay with it. But if a friend did have an issue with that I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they talked to me about. Just reach out to your friend :D
4027,isfp,"Hi all! :)
So for the past, I don't know, 3 months or so, I've been furiously researching jobs that I might enjoy. As a first-year student at a large public university on a full ride, I was originally going to pursue business, but soon found that was a horrible mismatch. I then focused on actuarial science - but, as an ISFP (MBTI test - Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving), I realized this would only be a sustainable career path for at most a year before I got antsy and wanted to do something more creative and ""hands-on"". Thus, the rapid scramble for major ideas.
So far, I've got it honed down to interior design, exercise science, and nutrition - these three engage some of my biggest interests, and I would undoubtedly be happy pursuing any one of these fields. However, none of them are particularly known for being lucrative or reliable fields to pursue. Therefore, I just wanted to ask you all, based on my desire for a job that provides a creative outlet, a fair amount of autonomy and stability, and decent pay, which of these paths do you think would be the most beneficial?
Sorry about the paragraph, but thank you all so much and any advice helps! A career in writing or art is always a consideration too!"
4028,isfp,I have no clue and now I am confused because I was going to take the Business route... sorry if this was not helpful. Nearly everyone I know is doing something not related to their degree so it may not matter too much... just do the thing you're most interested in.
4029,isfp,"interesting post - I am interested in all of these things(maybe not interior design, but art & design in general). I'm 23 now and have spent a few years on and off at a community college, trying to get an AA degree and study language/linguistics at a university, but I really don't enjoy it and find certain required classes too difficult for me, so I'm going to stop again.
Now I plan on becoming a personal trainer, because I'm interested in exercise & nutrition and find it really fun. I also like helping people and originally wanted to be a foreign language teacher, so being a personal trainer would be sort of similar and feels like it'd have a greater impact on my students. 
If I could go back 4 or 5 years ago, to high school, I would have probably tried to get into an art or design school and not gone to a community college. I just think I'd be a lot happier, even though I'd probably be in debt I might have a job I'd really like, but who knows, I try to not regret things in the past. 
For you I'd just suggest doing whichever one feels the best to you. At the time that was foreign language for me, but I remember friends of mine telling me to pursue art instead and I wish I had done that, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was the right choice. It's hard to say which one to chose - but I think you can have a career using any of those three interests, and even if university doesn't work out for whatever reason you can still pursue them in some form. I don't know how I'll like being a trainer, but I want to be able to move on at some point and work with art as my main focus. "
4030,isfp,"Yeah, it's hard when you're just about to take the plunge to university and don't know exactly where to go, like you don't want to make a choice you'll regret later. But then again, we need to take the plunge at some point so we can actually figure out what we love to do.
But aw, good luck to you on your journey to becoming a personal trainer! That's so exciting :) Hope it's super fulfilling!"
4031,isfp,"Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!
‚Äã
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg
‚Äã"
4032,isfp,"This is a bit long, but it feels wrong not to explain my perspective. Fi run amuck again. Feel free to skip to the questions below. 
‚Äã
PROFESSIONAL: 
Do you worry that you are not a ""professional"" enough person? Professional as in a person/employee/etc. with knowledge they can confidently give people eloquently. I think about professionalism in terms of being the go-to person for assistance. There is a sort of friendliness associated with the term for me in that people approach professionals with the confidence that they will know how to direct them. Great sales people, teachers, public speakers, and so on are typically seen as the caricature of ""professional"" that I often attribute to what I lack. 
‚Äã
Fi BLAH BLAH & THE ASPIRING FUNCTION: 
I personally don't inhabit this sense of professional and it heavily bothers me as it tends to make employment extremely difficult (INFP). I'm often highly aware of how much I don't know and how jumbled my explainations can be. I often say ""I hate working with people,"" but only mean it in terms of strangers. I typically like to chat with coworkers as I do not have to ""perform"" being ""professional"" for them once we are friendly. However, I've often considered that I would be my most highly evolved person once I reached ""professionalism."" I've read that given the 4th slot is the ""aspirational function,"" we may live our lives trying to feed it. To our growth or to our detriment. 
‚Äã
I grew up thinking I would become a Professor, but once given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant in graduate school, I almost passed out from the presentation anxiety several times. Everytime I got up to teach it was a strange mix of fear, empowerment, curiousity, and absolute hate. Naturally, I seriously started doubting my life course to become a Professor, but looking back now I still imagine myself ""evolving"" if I can just white knuckle my anxiety into that ""professional"" career that puts me into the spotlight that INFPs most often hate. In my case, I consider several careers until I find my way back to wanting to be a historian again, which seems like some kind of Si-Te wish fulfillment, although my Fi-Ne is often fired up with the research projects I choose to dive into and thus being a historian isn't just to serve some kind of Pokemon upgrade. (The fact that academic jobs are somewhat unicorns themselves is besides the point. The revolving desire of this professional career from an unprofessional person is what interests me.) 
‚Äã
QUESTIONS:
I'm wondering if this ""professional"" issue has to do with Te in the 4th slot? Maybe 4th slot Fe could bring this on for someone too? I'm not sure whether shadow functions apply here as the ""I'm not professional enough"" is a conscious assertion. 
‚Äã
Any other INFPs or other types with a similar issue? If it's a Te worry, I'd assume maybe ISFPs know the feeling as well? 
‚Äã
For people who do consider themselves professional: What's your type and do you attribute it to a particular function? 
‚Äã
I am cross posting this on other subreddits"
4033,isfp,"I'm an industrial chemist. I find my casual nature helps me excel at work because my managers like me for my down to earth vibe and can tell I dont take myself too seriously. I work in science where getting along with everyone and being likeable are refreshing and admired traits. I can also turn up to work looking like shit, which to me is the best thing ever. I hate the idea of a job where I'd have to wear a suit every day. I would struggle! My work is highly professional in that I needed a science degree and am surrounded by brilliant successful people, but from the outside we seem like a bunch of tradies. I reccomend finding a career like mine, you can still be professional without having to portray bullshit."
4034,isfp,I worry that I‚Äôm not good at my job. I‚Äôm not a very logical person and so when other people point out how inefficient the way I work is I get quite upset. Not because they‚Äôre wrong but because I didn‚Äôt notice it myself and it reminds me of how bad I am at being an efficient worker. Then I start to question whether or not I‚Äôm good enough to be there.
4035,isfp,"running for president of a club, just applied to work at my school‚Äôs women‚Äôs community center next semester as well as a mentoring programming! 
in terms of hobbies, I‚Äôm excited for the weather to get warmer so I can start practicing roller skating again and jumping rope outdoors! "
4036,isfp,"Preparing for a 2-month trip around Europe starting in a few weeks. Having a fairly hard time settling on a route/things to do, though, and my brother hasn't really been particularly prompt about getting a new passport, so some stress is starting to build up. But it should be pretty lit once it starts more properly coming together and we actually leave."
4037,isfp,"I‚Äôm an ISFP, and I‚Äôve done this to my SO. It‚Äôs mostly because I don‚Äôt want to burden them with all of my contemplation and struggling with stuff, but I can see how it might come off as being distant too. I hope it‚Äôs the same for you. "
4038,isfp,"Exactly the same! I mentioned to my SO ISFP that while I understand that he needs to sort his thoughts out, on his own, without any interference, it makes me feel like im not needed and that im alone in the relationship. He listened to what I had to say and said he will get back to me with a feedback in a couple of days. I dont know what it is, the concern that worries him so much, but the more I think about it, I just feel forgotten and ""just a friend"" kind a feeling. He is always polite and friendly, but it is like he is not alive anymore. It is really painful to watch, especially because he does not let me in, in his world, at least to be a listener. It really just makes me want to cry and the feeling of helplessness is never-ending. 
Edit: what would you suggest is the best approach in this case? It has been almost two months now that he is in this state. "
4039,isfp,"Imagine the isfp withdraws to independently solve his thoughts and completely ""forgets"" that he has someone beside him, who offers to listen and/or help.  He focuses only on himself, and is neglecting his SO."
4040,isfp,"That's really tough. It freaks me out whenever I feel like I'm abandoning someone, if anything, I ignore my own needs a lot so I can be there for others, which ends up making me feel really lost within myself. He probably REALLY wants to be mentally healthy so then he can properly be there for you, in a whole way. Problem is, its very hard to do that on your own. If he's really struggling, he needs to be able to talk to someone who is objective, like a therapist, to help him sort through his thoughts without hurting any feelings. I'm sure you're already being supportive and loving, so you're doing everything you can. He's gotta want to be okay, for himself! I'm in the same state currently and I check out and stop taking care of myself for others and it really hurts. I guarantee he loves and appreciates you, even if he struggles to communicate that. <3"
4041,isfp,"I feel you! I know what you mean! I have an ISFP husband who withdraws when he‚Äôs upset, and in the early days of our relationship, it took a lot of getting used to!
On average, he withdraws for four days. No talk, no emotions, no nothing. He‚Äôs still there but not really there.
In the early days, one week was normal.
The worst ever was one-month. -and that was for something I didn‚Äôt even know I said wrong!
But things are getting better now. He hasn‚Äôt had a shutdown in the past three months, and we‚Äôve been going through a ‚Äòhoneymoon‚Äô period of sorts. Total years we‚Äôve been married-four.
ISFP are introverted feelers, and they don‚Äôt need to process their emotions externally. They are not like INFJs who need to share their feelings, to sort it out. Internal processing takes longer, but when they get it sorted, ITS SORTED. As in the issue is done, dealt and dusted.
However if it starts to reach 2 months going on three, it would be cause for concern that probably what he‚Äôs dealing with can‚Äôt be sorted. In that situation maybe I‚Äôd advise to start getting help.
Edit: saw your previous posts and realized we may or may not be in the same situation. I suggest 2-3 months as the ‚Äòred-light‚Äô area, but that‚Äôs for a relationship where you live together and see each other almost 24-7. But depending on your situation and how much personal contact you have with ISFP, the ‚Äòred-light‚Äô area can be more or less. Trust your Ni. It‚Äôll tell you!"
4042,isfp,"Thank you so much...Sincerely...
I have been trying to understand his approach and I know I need my space and time and can become reclusive, but never for this amount of time. I underdstand that if it affects him to this point, it means it hurts him and he is feeling vulnerable and he probably does not want to show this side of him to me and how broken and miserable he may be. I totally agree with you that he may take his time to just recover on his own and for his own sake and this is necessary for our survival for us introverts in general. No matter how much I understand, I struggle with how much he interiorises his emotions. Maybe I just developed feelings for him to the point of ...hurting when he is hurting. Thank you again for your words, it is really helpful. p.s. Happy holidays!"
4043,isfp,"Thank you for such a nice reply!
Truth being said while we dont live together (at least, not yet), we have been friends for 1.5 years (he crushed on me) and now it is almost 3 of dating officially. Before this situation, we actually never stopped having honeymoon phases, with its peaks and smaller peaks, but never lows. This episode never happened before, and the mystery/secrecy I referred to in the other post (you are quite an observer : ) is still related to this. My gut is telling me something is going on, he would not ackowledge it at first, then he does, and now after I told him that it makes me feel like we are not in a relationship with two people, but just with one - me. He said he will soon tell me what it is and asked to give him as well a few days and he will try to gather his thoughts about this feeling of mine and how his approach makes me feel unhappy. I know he takes his time to process emotions, as if converting them into facts. But this emotional distance is a never before experienced situation and it makes me feel helpless. Because it is like seeing a person in pain, who actually keeps you at a distance and refusing any help. 
I think im going to let it be as it is. I wont force anything, but it creates uncertainties no matter how I look at it about the entire relationship.
He still asks me about my day and ongoing problems I may have. We end up talking about ""random"" work things and about me and my concerns. So he does show signs of care and affection. But this is something he was already doing as a friend...and I terribly miss the lover. 
If you have any wisdom on this, I would gladly take it. How do you deal with such situations"
4044,isfp,"You are right about it. The behaviours in relationship should not be excused based on MBTI. I thought I could find some elements of clarity at least from this perspective. I did already tell him that while I understand him, the reverse of this situation is that it makes me feel abandoned. Even if he keep asking routine check ups (how are you, did you do this, that, etc). I dont really feel controlled by him. I guess Im trying to atune my action according to his emotional state, but I speak up when something is bothering me. Im not afraid to tell him how I feel, in a healthy and adult way.  While not necessarily undermining my sense of self-worth, it does make me feel like there is a huge distance between us and just makes me wonder if there is a better way to communicate. 
This is actually what im trying to determine now. If there is something that can be done about it to make it better, to establish some way of making sure that when he needs to have such a time off, that I dont feel as cut off as I do now. I dont want to give up what we have because of this, while this is very frustrating.
It should not bother me, it is true. Maybe it is the fact that we are not physically near, living about 30 miles from each other and hectic schedules, which makes the distance longer."
4045,isfp,"Ahh ok. I get it a little more now. 
Instead of telling him how you don‚Äôt like the behavior, ask him why it takes so long to process thoughts or responses. Does this happen for serious topics or arguments only?  I find most people are just anxious and trying to create a response that does not make the other person upset, or they‚Äôre afraid of saying ‚Äúthe wrong thing.‚Äù And then there are people who are just plain avoidant and hope everyone will just forget about it. Which is the worst. Or maybe he just feels a lot and has trouble collecting his thoughts. 
I‚Äôm typing this on my phone so it‚Äôs probably a mess. But if you explain the situation more about what happens when he‚Äôs upset, and more about how you feel in the moment I can try to help you "
4046,isfp,"Weirdly enough, I feel lonelier when I'm in a group than when I'm alone. I can't click with most people. Even on Tinder, I can hardly find someone I can picture having casual sex with because it just doesn't feel right. I feel lonely on social media too, I feel no one cares about me and just follows me ""because"". They never even reply to my questions widget, it's really void and I just can feel the gap between their ways of being and mine. I only become ""hypersocial"" when I'm manic, but I really hate friend groups. I had one last year. It felt like a constant strain, I was overwhelmed, I was the ""out of place"" one who didn't like Kpop but thought I was able to change, I didn't have anything in common with them and they were always calling me ""overly dramatic"". I didn't get their humour, I found it lame and almost embarrassing. They fucked me over several times and I called it quits by disappearing, and though they later apologized, I was never able to come back.
But once I'm entirely by myself, I don't feel so lonely anymore. Sure, I need social interaction like any human, but my two therapists and the strangers on the street, or my mum (when we have something to talk about), are enough. I have one very close friend who lives in India, and while we can't really talk right now because she's busy af (she's graduating soon, the homestretch is always hard), I know we always have this love for each other and it's just what I need. I sometimes visit my relatives too when I've got money for train tickets, and it ""recharges"" my social meter, so to say. I always feel good around them, and I can never feel unhappy after spending time with them. A few weeks ago I went to visit my great-aunt who lives 2 hours away from me, and I loved every little bit of the weekend. Even the Airbnb host was really good to me. It was great. It's the simplest pleasures of life.
I only need myself, my cats, my family and my friend, whom I feel is possibly the person I want to spend my life with. I don't need all that ""have a group of friends"" garbage, or parties, or ""nights out with the girls"". That stuff is excessive and completely overrated. Simplicity and trust are happiness, in my books."
4047,isfp,Im not very lonely but Im little bit lonely because I dont usually start the convorsation when im talking to the stranger and I dont like to be in a big group. It gives me anxiety somehow meaby because I think too much what people think about me. 
4048,isfp,"Absolutely. When I have good friends I have this horrible feeling that we're in the process of drifting away. Every time I see a good friend I worry that it's going to be the last. When I meet people who I click with, I'm self destructive and don't make any effort as a defence mechanism. So it's self inflicted, and I know I need to shift my perspective because on paper I have a lot of friends and I should be really happy."

4050,isfp,"I see this posted a lot, and it couldn't be more different for me. I'm not sure if it's a confidence thing, but I absolutely hate learning new things or skills, particularly relating to work.
I wonder if it's partly because I enjoy working in a hands-on, visual way, and the things I'm learning at work right now (i.e. programming interfaces or factory pattern methods) are all quite the opposite.
Do you guys enjoy learning new things? Or does it depend (as I think it does in my case) very much on what you're learning, and how you're learning it?"
4051,isfp,"I like to learn new things provided I can do it autonomously, in my own way, and I can choose what it is that I'm learning. I hated school because I wasn't able to learn that way. 
I'm more so a hands on learner than anything but I'm quite visual as well. "
4052,isfp,"I am usually a slow learner, because I over complicate things, and I feel like if I don't understand every infinite detail of something then I don't understand it at all. I like to be thorough, and it's hard when I'm new at something and I only know the basics. I also think slowly in general, because my brain seems more interested in leisurely exploring an idea than in ever coming to conclusions.  It makes a lot of quick-thinking people assume I'm incredibly dumb at first because I'll always be frozen like a deer in the headlights when asked for my thoughts.  But later on, once I've gathered and sorted through all the details, people are surprised to discover that I have a much deeper and more analytical understanding of things than they thought I was capable of. Now that I've been at my job for a year and a half I feel like people trust me with the things I've learned, but they also understand I'm not the best person to dump a complicated new project on because I'll spend way too much time thinking about it without any visible results. "
4053,isfp,"I like starting to learn new things, but I have trouble once things start getting difficult. At first it might come surprisingly easily to me, but once it gets to that point where I start struggling I just can't get myself to keep going. My dad tried teaching me guitar once and he said I was picking it up way faster than he ever did. I was so into it at first, teaching myself simple melodies, learning chords, all that stuff. Then I started having trouble with changing from one chord to another and instead of working at it I just let myself lose interest. I know just doing it enough will build my muscle memory and it'll be easier with time, but I guess having a strong start made it hard for me not to get discouraged when it suddenly wasn't easy for me anymore. I really need to try getting back into it."
4054,isfp,"I usually like learning new things, especially if it's something I'm interested in, but if it gets frustrating or I have trouble understanding it then I won't enjoy it as much. 
I don't always like learning in a group setting because I find there's more pressure than if I'm learning myself. I also learn best hands on and visually, rather than just hearing a bunch of stuff"
4055,isfp,"I think learning things hands-on is a lot of fun, especially if it's the sort of thing that gives me immediate feedback (like an instrument or drawing). It's hard for me to actually get around to start learning something, but once I'm in the groove, I don't want to stop."
4056,isfp,"I dislike vague descriptions like that. Most people do enjoy learning. but learning what?
I like learning things that help me improve myself overall. Currently I'm studying German after dropping it for awhile. Also reading up on homeschooling styles (I'd like to in the future if I have kids), the Protestant Reformation (partly because it's important to my heritage and also for a book I'm working on), and now some realist poets. When I was little I loved dinosaur movies and picture books and made up games with my dino toys. In 3rd grade I started my Greek mythology fixation that lasted a few years.
I think what generally differentiates our motivations for learning from most other types is we want to get something out of it. We don't usually learn for its own sake like xNTPs. Look at Sherlock (ISTP but same Se placement as us). He has a variety of useful skills he's developed over the years, and he refuses to learn/hold onto information he considers ""useless"" like the movement of the sun. He also is a chemistry major- which helps his job in a huge variety of ways. Se wants flexibility.
And LisaPizza made a good point. Some of us are slow learners (at least appear to be) because we want to grasp what it is we're learning carefully then try it ourselves. Se needs experience. Or rather, IS experience."
4057,isfp,This. For a while I questioned whether I was ISFP because of that part of me but here it is. This was one the best descriptions I've read.
4058,isfp,"Could somebody explain this? I don't understand the way this is phrased, perhaps because a reality is something that has already come to fruition. Are they trying to say ISFPs imagine evil things but don't act on them? Or maybe do evil things without realizing how terrible they are?"
4059,isfp,"Haha right?  My girlfriend (ENTP) asked me about this idea about life being a movie because she didn't understand if I was the Protagonist or a by stander to the great picture and what you said sums up what I said to her. 
That I am sometimes the lens in which the film is portrayed and at times I decide to step into that film from off screen and be a character if not fully the protagonist of the story. 
At least I said something to that extent. She's still trying to figure out how I see the world. "
4060,isfp,"The way you phrased it is essentially right. There are times where the worst possible thing comes into my head that would really hurt someone else or is just bad in general, but generally we don't act on those things. I don't think that this is something that is soley ISFP and INFP, but I think it tends to happen to us a bit more and that the after effects are a bit worse (thats just from knowing how I feel after those thoughts, not everyone else so that last sentence could be completely wrong lol)"
4061,isfp,"ISFP here. For me its like...while someone else may say they want someone to get hit bus and have that desire just be a passing feeling, I will be thinking ""I should get a bus and hit this person because I'm feeling X."" Aaand I can actually picture that as a reality. I can imagine all of the foreseeable scenarios that will occur afterwards (who will be affected, what will happen to me, etc.) But then...I know that I just wont do it and that I actually don't feel like I can ever do that to someone."
4062,isfp,"I really enjoyed woodworking, however it doesn't pay very well unless you get to management, which then it is completely different. Dabbled in many careers - mostly feeler type like teaching and previously worked in customer service. I'm moving into coding which feels like a lot of fun. At first thought I wouldn't like ""tech"" because it doesn't seem creative or ""warm"", but actually found it really creative and inspirational. You can create a large impact on people without needing to be in the public spotlight and you can creatively solve problems."
4063,isfp,"Hey there! I LOVE being a musician üòä It fulfils my Introverted Feeling and Extraverted Sensing (Writing music, designing logos and posters, performing), and it satisfies my Extraverted Thinking (Managing bookings and social media, creating marketing plans, and budgeting). 
The money isn‚Äôt great, but it‚Äôs an amazing outlet and it ultimately makes me happy."
4064,isfp,"still in school, but I really like dentistry...so far. you get to use your hands, provide a really important service and the avg dentist works less 40 hrs a week if hobbies/home life are super important to you."
4065,isfp,"Teaching a martial art, and managing a martial arts school, is amazingly well-suited for me.
It's part desk job (which is supposed to be bad for ISFPs) but only a few hours a day, and the rest of the time I am helping people learn an art which I love, and which has helped me tremendously.  I get to be active, do good, spread good vibes.
The ""I"" part of me was afraid to stand in front of a group and teach, but I got over that in instructor training."
4066,isfp,"I'm still in school right now. I'm probably going to sound like a super typical ISFP but I'm currently getting my graphic design degree at the moment and then I will go get my fine arts degree and teaching certification possibly. I love being in a creative program at school it can be stressful at times but I'm always very motivated and excited about what I get to learn. I think I'd like to be a high school art teacher eventually. The only thing I'm worried about is public speaking but I feel like if I'm teaching something that I love it will be easier. Before getting into this program I majored in music which I loved but it was too competitive and I couldn't see myself doing it professionally for the rest of my life. Then I switched to psychology which was interesting at first but I never really felt like I ""fit in"" with the other people in the program and then I switched to political science very briefly. I feel like it can be really difficult to find the right path for ISFP's bc most of the things we love to do don't usually pay the bills "
4067,isfp,"I feel the same way. (ha, funny how I said ‚Äúfeel‚Äù here... guess that‚Äôs just an ISFP for you!) I am trying to stay positive though. I like this quote from Steve Jobs. It has encouraged me when I want to give up. "
4068,isfp,"I have thought about it, but there really isn't a ""bridge program"" or anything, so I would basically be starting over. I am going back to school to become a certified strength and conditioning specialist. I really want to teach continuing education courses for clinicians. "

4070,isfp,"I wish I knew 
jk that thing you're feeling is Si. It's your dumb raw emotions trying to take over. But guess what? Si is not in your main 4 functions, it's a little crap that shouldn't even be there. It's a little joke God put in there.
You don't have to feel it. You are an ISFP like me. We don't have to care, ever. We can swipe left forever and be fine with it. Just stop being anxious and be awesome instead. All it takes is for you to start doing it. Or you can be dumb like me and waste years of your life in depression. But I don't recommand it. I didn't find anything interesting staring in the abyss. "
4071,isfp,"Two things have helped me with anxiety: 1) Never abuse yourself. Would you treat someone you love the way you treat yourself? Learn to accept your flaws. Even if you did something wrong, the past is the past now. Let it go, and be open to failure in the future...which brings me to 2) What's stressing you out is either in your control ( the only thing in your control are your choices for yourself) and you can be productive about it, or like most things in life, completely out of your control. The former, you're wasting time stressing because you can do something about it; the latter, you can relax because you have zero responsibility for what happens next. 
Example: say you're looking for a new friend or mate and you're afraid of rejection. What is in control is your decency to the person/being yourself (with the aforementioned self-love, you'll find more confidence in accepting who you are and mistakes you make); what's out of your control is if that person likes you. Even if they don't like you, its not up to you, so no use stressing over it."
4072,isfp,"I'm ISFP and have general anxiety disorder (GAD, its the most common anxiety disorder since they're so hard to define) and I've found that therapy and breathing exercises have been the most helpful. Definitely find some ways to de-stress yourself. Personally, I like and am triggered by ASMR videos and de-stress that way if I'm feeling particularly wound up or having the crippling kind that hurts my heart. And distracting myself is general is helpful to calming down. Good luck!"
4073,isfp,"I was diagnosed with anxiety literally last night and had the heart jittery anxiety the latter part of the day. Also felt like I wanted to cry/die. This is all anxiety/depression related though, I don't consider this related to type. Anyone can have anxiety or depression.
Edit: I forgot about the advice part. First, therapy. It may take a while to find a good one (my post history will tell my story) but you'll know when you find one that works for you. Second....that's as far as I am now."
4074,isfp,"YEAH me too, i'm not one to complain but i can see it helping. Sometimes it even helps for me to just step outside and focus on my breathing. I didn't think to try to change the cause though, I should try that. I've been obsessing about trying to lessen the anxiety itself instead of thinking what could cause it.. Hm. Thanks for your input :)"
4075,isfp,"I too am pretty sensitive about my physical environment. I noticed that I start to get really anxious if I'm working on a cluttered desk, or if I'm at work and there's a lot of customers yelling. I'm not claustrophobic or OCD or anything, but those two things really bother me."
4076,isfp,"I know i don't have to care.. and i've swiped left to several things in my life that are unhealthy (including my sister). it's just, the things i want to care about are hard to care about. I know i don't need to. It's a mess. I'm trying to get out of that now, out of depression. I guess i'm just not quite where you are yet, you know? Soon, i hope. "
4077,isfp,"Hey y'all,
After thinking I was an ISTP for a long time, I've finally come to the conclusion that I'm actually an ISFP.
After I got diagnosed with Aspergers last week, I wanted to revisit all the types because now I knew some of my traits are actually because of my Aspergers and not because of my personality. And after doing more research, ISFP just made sense to me, more so than ISTP.
Just wanted to say I'm happy to be here!"
4078,isfp,"First reddit post. I got here from a thread from another subreddit. Not sure how to link to that thread but he was in a state of anxiety, like kinda how I am in right now. One of the guys mentioned to take a personality test and find a subreddit to post to. So here I am."
4079,isfp,"FYI, if you want to reply to people hit the ""reply"" button underneath their comment. Don't just type up a new comment :P
How do you feel about the results of your personality test? I got really excited from mine because I thought it was super accurate. I identify myself with it at this point. "
4080,isfp,"Also, check out this video that gives a really good explanation about what Reddit is, since you seem a little confused. Feel free to ask any questions that you may have."
4081,isfp,"To a certain extent, I think that's okay. I know my tendencies, but every now and then I surprise myself. I don't think personhood is a static thing, so even if you have a full understanding of yourself from a particular time, it will change. And that's fine. Some people you know all your life, but you can still find out new things about them. Same with yourself"
4082,isfp,"I have no idea who I am either, but I'm okay with it. I have to say, though, that I ""feel most myself"" when I'm out in nature or looking at/watching/listening to/reading/eperiencing something beautiful."
4083,isfp,"I feel like I spent my first 30 years of life living as I thought I should based on the guidance of others. Then after a bout of depression and 3 years of therapy, I've been discovering myself lately and I love it. 
I also think that Fi's need for deep understanding makes us feel like we don't know ourselves well when other types wouldn't necessarily make this conclusion."
4084,isfp,"Yes! How other people describe me usually catches me off guard. Based on what others have said, I'm a lot quieter, more 'peaceful', more grounded, more serious and more logical than I realize. It's always strange though, because I view myself almost entirely in a different light. I think of myself as pretty talkative and goofy and kind of annoying, almost ditzy. While that side definitely comes out more with close friends, I tend to think that's how I portray myself to the entire world, when typically, I'm simply the 'nice, quiet girl'. I actually thought I was an EXFP for a while, until I realized how often people would mention how quiet or difficult to get to know I was when they first met me. I'm not entirely sure on the ISFP thing either, because I have a difficult time differentiating between whether that is who I truly am or more how I want to be."
4085,isfp,"I have a lot of fragmented thoughts that fly in different directions. They‚Äôre rarely narrative in structure‚Ä¶ which would flow like a journey towards an end goal.
I wish I knew why
One of my theories is that I‚Äôm bombarded with sensations which narrows my scope of attention. Sometimes I get so focused on the micro details of the situation that I lose sight of the bigger picture. A minute ago I spent about 30 seconds re writing the word ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù; something about the conjunction was bothering me. But merely the process of deleting and re-writing that sentence was almost just as captivating as the intention I had to begin writing this. 
It‚Äôs why I have such a hard time sticking to things long term. It‚Äôs so easy to get lost in the moment. 
Is it something I can control? Yeah, with a lot of effort. Do I wish I was different? I guess, but wishing that doesn‚Äôt change the reality. Am I just lacking a long term goal which is important to me? Perhaps, but I haven‚Äôt been able to construct a sustainable goal that extends far into the future. Or maybe my idea of a goal needs to be less objective and more subjective‚Ä¶
Because every time I conceptualize what I seriously want to have accomplished on my deathbed, it‚Äôs less about the accolades and more about the person I became throughout the process. 
I admire people not for their material achievements, but for their personality and values. How authentic was this person in expressing what they truly felt? Whether it was ‚Äúright or wrong‚Äù is less important than sloppily expressing your personal truths. Obviously we‚Äôre all constrained by the environment we‚Äôre in‚Ä¶ we sacrifice our authenticity to maintain order in the social realm. I wouldn‚Äôt joke around in a sexual way in my corporate job nor would I have an unfiltered laugh at a friend‚Äôs funeral for some selfish reason. 
But for some reason this personality trait: authenticity, or congruence, or alignment with thoughts and actions in a genuine way, is what I‚Äôm powerfully drawn to, both in myself and others. Again and again, it appears to be the highest virtue I strive for. And the more my attention is focused on authenticity, the more trivial other things become.  Petty insecurities like how others perceive me become completely subordinate to my pursuit of authentic expression.
It‚Äôs why I respect things like spirituality and religion. Though they‚Äôre not the only mechanisms of inducing a purpose filled life, they limit your focus of attention towards what‚Äôs the most important. I read a book about how the most happy people are the least focused on being happy, the successful companies aren‚Äôt the most focused on profit, and the most creative people don't force themselves to be creative. It‚Äôs as if these achievements and skills arise in an oblique way, indirect rather than direct. And yet these achievements are often percieved to be the result of deliberate systematic technique, it appears they arise as a mere side effect of something more important.
While this doesn‚Äôt extrapolate much about my original point, I think you can see how my thoughts become scattered. I go down vortex‚Äôs of thought‚Ä¶ building and building on an idea as the sensations captivate me through time. But maybe I can string an idea together‚Ä¶
I originally criticized myself for how shortsighted my attention and focus was. But what if that's a mere side effect of authenticity?
...Because how could authenticity be conceptualized in the future, when the very definition of authenticity is ACTING in alignment with your thoughts and feelings? One cannot ACT in the future. So by definition, my highest virtue requires immediate action to feedback whether I‚Äôm being authentic. So my own critique of being shortsighted and bombarded by emotions is perpetuated by my striving to act authentically in the moment. Perhaps, a more sophisticated goal would could be to be as congruent as possible for the longest amount of time; strive for the state of being authentic, and every material accolade and success would arise indirectly.
And that goal feels right to me. 
Until it doesn't."
4086,isfp,"As a type we're known for not planning far into the future, and personally I prefer it that way. I like having my options and don't mind living on impulse, it has never bothered me in the past but I acknowledge that it does not always benefit me especially if I'm working towards a deadline. I find myself at the mercy of my very fickle motivation and everything from the environment to nagging questions in my head distract me while working (I currently do freelance but I plan to switch to a day job soon and see how that works for me) As much I hate it I need to discipline myself a bit :(
My point is, if it doesn't affect the quality of your work or your goals then there's really no problem in being authentic and living in the moment :)"
4087,isfp,"I'll preface this by saying I'm an INFJ and I've been crushing on an ISFP for 3 months (browsing this sub for a week), and I think this was the last piece of the puzzle that helped me 110% understand her. 
She's interested in me because we worked together (catering) and I was 100% myself around everyone. I've been depressed for 10 straight years, and only recently truly started coming out of it last year (just before I met her). I stopped worrying about how people close to me would see me and I just opened up and was completely myself, and it wasn't as bad I'd always thought. People actually liked me better, when I got outside of my head and just really acted like myself. I'm thinking this and 100% confidence in my decision-making skills is what she saw in me. 
If you'll allow me to parallel her and yourself, I would say that she really needs to remind herself to take care of herself and following through with her little hobbies she has, like knitting or watching netflix. But, she feels like that's a waste of time, so she always prefers to be in-the-moment and is hanging out with her friends all the time, but rarely lets herself cut loose and enjoy herself when she's alone and forgets to take care of herself --- in that, she needs to follow through with her hobbies because she chose them for the exact right reasons, but doesn't follow through with them on an everyday/cathartic-basis because she feels like it's not 'productive' or 'conducive' enough for a future, even though those hobbies are the only things that can really take her mind off of herself. 
I would say, the short-attention span is great, because you're always in the moment, but the thing is, you definitely overlook how therapeutic a hobby could be; it's not natural for you guys, but you have to consciously and actively let yourselves relax on a regular basis. Because, the thing is, your hobbies ARE your authentic self, but you keep stressing about ""more important"" things you should be doing than letting yourself breathe and enjoy whatever your hobby is. 
How does that sound?"
4088,isfp,"Are you actually working a corporate job, or were you expressing your point? If you are, it sounds like you should leave corporate behind, it sounds like you need to go do you.
If you were just looking to express yourself here then know someone read this and appreciates it."
4089,isfp,"Pretty much my life up to this point. I took a job for the mere point that I‚Äôd be able to make great money and be independent. I had some success, but you mentioned religion and spirituality. I would consider myself to be a conservative Christian. 
The fact that what had to motivate me to get up each day, and do the things I didn‚Äôt want to do (make sales calls, knock doors, etc) was not only incongruent with my own personality, but also didn‚Äôt feel to authentically align with my faith. My focus was upon gaining more material thing, greater financial success, not providing for the less fortunate and giving away what I don‚Äôt need. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was generous, but to force myself to do the things I didn‚Äôt want to do and were what I now know incongruent with my personality I didn‚Äôt have this alignment of belief and action, and it bothered me tremendously. 
I remembered I would seek counsel from people and try to articulate how I felt like I had to worship money to be able to do my chosen line of work. Often times the folks would give me advice like ‚Äúdo it to help people‚Äù or ‚Äúfocus on doing it as though the work is on behalf of God‚Äù. Which in theory is great and all, but what I‚Äôve come to realize only in the last month is that my work is truly incongruent to its core as to who I am and this is why I struggle so immensely. 
It‚Äôs tough because I feel like we live in a ENTJ or ESTP kind of world, and I had learned to modify my external behavior to mimic these traits, and ultimately it just wasn‚Äôt who I was, although we normally all have some traits of the opposite personalities. 
Anyway, looks like I might have just rambled. This might have been more for me, than you, but your post helped me realize some of these things. Thanks, and I absolutely identify with your struggle. "
4090,isfp,"Solid point. Obviously only living in the moment or only in the future are too extreme, and our type prefers the moment. Whether it‚Äôs good or bad or not really depends on the context of the situation and how you approach discomfort. Will you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm isfp so I won‚Äôt bother with planning‚Äù or will you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm isfp so I‚Äôm naturally more inclined to be impulsive SO it‚Äôs important to think a little more strategically right now, since it will produce a goal I want‚Äù. I obviously think we agree on the latter. "

4096,isfp,"So a while back ago I kinda got dumped by this lass I was with a while, TL;DR she found someone who clicked better with her, I guess. We're still good friends, thankfully, because my personality doesn't allow me to be a major bitch over it. But I still can't help but feel jealous and insignificant, almost like I'm a #2. I did hash it out with her though, it's not my fault or anything wrong, they just seemed better for each other. But my personality is such that I'm... I can be really... Urgh. I value loyalty a lot and I think it's been torn from me and get too emotionally invested (I'm ISFP 6w7, btw) and now I'm just getting too upset at myself (right in the middle of the exams too!) What should I do?"
4097,isfp,It seems like you have a mature understanding of the relationship. I think it's best to realize that it's no ones fault. Break ups suck but it doesn't make you or her a worse person because you didn't click. It might be best just to distance yourself for a while to let the feelings dissipate. 
4098,isfp,"Be realistic with your self and maybe think in terms of 3rd person, tell your self what you would tell someone else in your shoes. 
I think its common for us to be overly harsh when we wouldn't be to anyone else. 
Anyway, good luck dude."
4099,isfp,"You should separate yourself from her for a while. It makes it harder for you to move on if you are around her/ talking to her. And since you value loyalty so much, you need to consider how loyal other people are to you. It's only fair to treat others as you would treat yourself. It's important to realize that you're not obligated to be her friend-- it doesn't make you a ""major bitch"" ;)"
4100,isfp,"Well, maybe not a lot lot, but I noticed that often when I'm called shallow it's by an xNFP. Normally get along with them well, but I get really annoyed when they do this. What does it even mean? Why do I even care?"
4101,isfp,"I can only speak for INFP's. One of my roommates is an INFP. Dude thinks he's deep. Like Mariana Trench deep. We don't insult each other though, so I'm not sure how he would decide to hurt me if he wanted to try.
My roommates are INTJ, ENTP, and INFP (him). I find him the hardest to get along with. I clash with him more than the ENTP and that says a lot. I think that has more to do with him, and not his type though."
4102,isfp,"Are they people who know of MBTI, that they‚Äôre xNFP and you‚Äôre ISFP? I know in MBTI communities there‚Äôs often a bit of an intuitive ego trip going on. If it‚Äôs just people irl then I don‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been called shallow."
4103,isfp,"xnfp here...somewhat nervously wading into the discussion..
I have a close friendship with an isfp and with the chance to observe his wit and depth of emotion I'd certainly never call him (or regard this type) as being shallow. 
He definitely prefers topics I find a bit shallow though like stuff he wants to buy, and has all but banned me from bringing up some topics I prefer.
And considering how well isfps hide their inner thoughts, and how focused they are on the present and doing things with people rather than discussing them, i'm not surprised some xnfp's can be presumptuous. 
But like..how often are you called shallow? I know it's kind of an insult but if it's that common maybe you just do seem a little shallow - which is perfectly fine isn't it? Personally I think it's pretty short-sighted to assume any person is bereft of deeper thought, but there are certainly people who are more concerned with superficial topics and those more concerned with deep philosophical ones, neither is the right way to be, they're just both ways to be. 
An identical (opposite) conversation happens almost daily on r/infp about whether infp's even have the ability to focus up and live in the real world. Sure no one calls us shallow, but we are the starry-eyed indigo babies of the mbti and we're maybe too deep in the forest to ever follow the trees back out."

4106,isfp,"All of this is pretty spot on! 
Since you're courting her, I'll add that in the gift area I'm definitely more of an experience over object kinda gal. Gestures of affection (tickets to a show, doing the dishes for me, or flowers that will bloom over the next week) are usually preferred over knick knacky things that I'll eventually forget (sorry, Mr Husband!). I have a much better memory/appreciation for things my husband does with me than for things he's purchased for me."

4108,isfp,"Just a little rant, maybe you can share some insights with me. 
My isfp crush keeps going for these gossipy shallow but flirty and confident girls. I know one of his previous crushes was on a real bitch who said mean things about me behind my back (called me useless) while another gave me a mean stare. They both act really shallow like I said and I can see them being mean to others too. He got rejected by both. 
I dont think that he is compatible with those girls at all, if they get into a relationship I'm pretty sure he will end up being a pushover. They are not good for someone sensitive and soft hearted like him. However I can see why he would be attracted to girls like that, they display a certain power that he doesnt and they are on the surface very bubbly and happy
He has a history with feeling worthless and sometimes depressed but I think its improved. Sometimes I think that he needs to grow up a bit and choose girls who are more compatible. 
Hes someone Im very attracted to but I prefer to be a good friend to him as he is because thats the best I can do for him. I hope that he is able to find someone to be happy with though and when he does Ill support it. We are both 21 y/o"
4109,isfp,"Can‚Äôt speak for him, but for me, I don‚Äôt really care if a girl I like doesn‚Äôt get along with one of my friends.  It sorta sucks but it‚Äôs hardly a deal breaker.  I also tend to like confident, aggressive girls because I don‚Äôt like being the one making all the moves.  "
4110,isfp,"I feel like feeling worthless is pretty common for 21 years old nowadays. Fresh out of college and most likely unemployed or working a shit job that someone can do with just a high school education would do that. 
Nothing anyone say or do will change them, not until they actually start doing something they are passionate about which might take a few years.  
Also it sounds to me like you want to be his friend just to be close to him. And tbh if the feeling is mutual he wouldnt go out and try to find other girls while you are around. I would suggest you stop worry about his choice in dates and decide if you are actually his friend because you care about him and not because you are infatuated with him, dont become a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù. "
4111,isfp,"Lol he doesnt seem to care much about me getting along with his friends. He said his friends were in the wrong and told me to ignore them and block them. I wouldnt like a guy who lets his friends influence his decisions too much anyways. 
I can take initiative but Im not exactly agressive unless someone hurts me in some way then I'd be an agressive monster. I think its the Te bitchslap? Unsure of my type but I might be an en/sfp. I wont ever be agressive though in other situations, it sounds overbearing and controlling. 
I do have confidence, or rather self esteem but I dont always show it becsuse its best to have quiet confidence, loud confidence tend to be someone arrogant/insecure who needs to express it. Sometimes Im not so confident about my various skills and sometimes I am, depends on my mood. Social situations Im confident depending on my mood and people I am with. "
4112,isfp,"I have no problem with him dating other girls its his life not mine. But his choice of dates just disturbs me a little and I am hesitant to tell him that. In the end its best if he figures it out by himself. 
And his self esteem disturbs me. His career is nice he already got interships down and will find a job and he likes what he does. 
I suppose you are kind of right though. I am not actively dating but I still keep my eye out for potential matches including isfp and some other guys from ok cupid. He isnt really within my friend zone but not exactly out of it either. Just want to consider a lot of possible guys and see what happens I guess"
4113,isfp,"Hey, Yumekawa, just a quick heads-up:
agressive is actually spelled aggressive. You can remember it by two gs.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
4114,isfp,"I guess aggressive wasn‚Äôt the best word for it.  Maybe assertive would have been better lol.  I‚Äôm kind of a hypocrite though because I like it when girls take the initiative and reach out to me, but if they text me all the time/don‚Äôt give me space, then it can be over the top and I lose interest.  In person though I like it when a girl is easy to talk to and isn‚Äôt afraid to joke around or call me out on shit.  Weirdly every relationship I‚Äôve been in the girl tends to put in all the work in terms of reaching out, expressing interest initially etc.  So idk what to tell you, maybe give him space, but also make sure to keep contact with him.  I‚Äôd also say to make it somewhat obvious you like him or at least drop hints"
4115,isfp,"Yeah what‚Äôs with all the cynicism in the comments. Person who wrote them isn‚Äôt even isfp. Op I‚Äôm glad you are supportive of him, and not trying to force anything on him. I think what you are doing right now (being supportive) is the best option.
But also you should take care of yourself. Knowing how you feel about him, you should distance yourself a little and try to stop liking him, because I‚Äôll only make you upset if he starts dating someone (even if the other is a good match)."
4116,isfp,"I take most of the initiative to reach out to him, hes so bad at texting but lately its not one sided and hes been chiming in when I share my ideas with him. I make sure to not text him too much, once I went a month without texting him but that was also when we are both busy. 
I do drop some semi flirtatious hints for him like teasing him, he always acts so awkward embarassed and never responds to those but doesnt hate me for it so its fun for me hahaha. My friends think hes boring on the surface and unsure what I see in him but Im quite attracted to him. 
If he asked me to go out with him though Id say sure Im kinda attracted to you but Im not sure if you are in the friend zone or not. 
As for now I actually hope he doesnt date anyone including me until he can find himself more. "
4117,isfp,"Well everyone does have their own opinion and in a way candypharts is right. But Im not big into dating at the moment so Im just going with the flow. Theres other people that I might want to date other than the isfp but I am definitely quite attracted to him
But I guess Im just concerned about him as a friend and frustrated I cant do anything to help because he really is a kind soul and I wish he would stop falling for those mean flirty girls who seem to break his heart. He kept getting in fights with the last crush he had, I try to compliment him in genuine ways sometimes when I do talk to him which is about once in a week because I can sense its deflating his self esteem. Im suspicious of why they would get into fights because he usually is a very reasonable person and discovered its probably the mean girl. Maybe Im looking too much into it though."
4118,isfp,"Idk it seems like you really like this guy.  The friend zone is bullshit lol, and if you don‚Äôt want him to date other people than obviously you have feelings for him.  I changed my mind, I think you should just flat out ask him to do something and make a move.  At worst you get rejected and can move on.  At best you get the answer you want and can take it from there"
4119,isfp,"There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having physical attraction as a criteria for being attracted to someone. Most people are like that. Also it scientifically makes sense. You sound like you know what you want. Which is good.
That‚Äôs good‚Äî many people don‚Äôt have that kind of support. When he realizes his strengths and gains more confidence he probably won‚Äôt like those people anymore. "
4120,isfp,"Im pretty sure he doesnt like me that way, I think I had my closure. Him dating others might sting but I'll put up with it, it will happen. I want to see him date a girl who isnt a bitch though, it will make me happy. "
4121,isfp,"I heard isfps are not good at recognizing their strengths? Is that true? 
But I dont think external validation will make him 
recognize his strengths, he has to convince himself first so thats why I cant do much. Maybe hes not ready to date someone yet, they say that you should recognize your own strengths and love yourself before getting into a relationship. 
Haha I guess I also want to figure out how he thinks because its fun, I do it with a lot of my friends and thats what got me into mbtis. "
4122,isfp,"I think isfps underestimate their strengths because their strengths aren't looked up to in general-- being polite, easy going, humble, practical etc. Especially, if you look around in mbti forums, N-types are always like ""oh, they are nice but they are boring"", etc. Also it doesn't help that in real life, not the internet, more aggressive types tend to talk over us or disregard our opinions (even some of the more ""nice"" people, like I've had enfjs, enfps, and esfps wanting to tell me what to do). I think that isfps are good at recognizing some strengths, however. But they really do have to trust themselves and their gut instinct of what is right, and what to do.
You make a really good point about external validation. It's especially hard for us growing up because everything is about extrinsic value, not intrinsic value. In high school and college, you suddenly have to worry about your career and money, about material things. Most people, not only Fi-doms, of course, need to work towards intrinsic value too, but Fi-doms are not very good at working towards things that give extrinsic value (unlike Te-doms), so of course, we struggle with both. 
And you are right about learning to love yourself before dating someone. Perhaps he'll have to learn by actually experiencing it. But it's probably something deeper-- he probably has something similar to anxious attachment style if he keeps serial dating. Isfps have a weird thing with wanting to be with people we want to be. He only sees the good in these girls and wants to be like them somehow too, while also having someone to validate him and his worthiness. Everyone wants to be loved. Sadly and obviously, it will backfire.
Yes, I like typing my friends too ;) even people I don't really know like my coworkers."
4123,isfp,"Still, anything can happen in the future but I wouldnt count on the chances of him changing his mind. I will never ask him out though, he'd have to ask me out because it's proven he is capable of asking a girl he really likes anyways but like I said I wont count on that 
Right now Im still working on my studies but do look guys up on ok cupid sometimes. I need to get a degree and not be distracted by dating but if I do meet someone who fits I will not miss the chance"
4124,isfp,"Well I think he has a lot of strengths and never gives himself enough credit. He gets good grades, got internships, is more reasonable than most people, is considerate, realistic, humble, dependable, sensitive, and I can list a lot more. I can see him wanting to be more assertive and outgoing though. In my opinion he is blind to those girls and they clash with what he is. He needs to learn to validate himself, doesnt matter what society expects, he has value as an unique human being. Hopefully two wrong experiences will convince him to look deeper and realize whats important. No chance he will get that mean girl, she got a boyfriend recently. It should be a wake up call to Mr. Isfp. 
Dont always listen to what others tell you what to do or think, they are not you and wont know the full picture, take everything with a grain of salt. I dont completely agree with what candypharts said, he doesnt know Mr. Isfp nor me so its weird to jump to those kinds of conclusions. "
4125,isfp,"I would suggest pitting yourself out there as much as possible and talking to as many dudes as possible.  Based on my experience the more you focus on one person, the less likely it is to happen.  The less you care, the more options you have, the more appealling you‚Äôll be to this one dude.  And if it doesn‚Äôt work... fuck it lol.  I‚Äôd siggest trying out tinder very easy to meet dudes on there whether you‚Äôre looking for a good time or a long time haha"
4126,isfp,"That sounds like a lot of what my friends would say to me as well haha. But actually I keep my friends from knowing how inconsiderate, selfish, and unreasonable I can be. My family members, who take a lot of my crap, are the only ones I show my ugly side to (well, they put a lot of pressure on me to perform well). Maybe the guy has family members who put pressure on him and lower his self-esteem? There are many factors to consider. Every time they say those nice things to me, I would always be like. ""ha ha, but I'm not that _____"". But it's better now. It's improved because the external pressure is not as bad as it used to be. 
I used to struggle with this A LOT. I mean, I still struggle with it a little but it's better now. I know what I want mostly, and I listen to my gut for what's right. Yeah, I find candypharts interpretations pretty negative. I don't even know why he/she is in the isfp forum because he/she likes to talk smack about sensors. "
4127,isfp,"When I go onto Tinder I get way too many messages I have to sort through. Too many players and their biographies are very superficial. Ill start looking after that last horrible semester this fall is over, right now it isnt my priority. 
Its ok eventually things will work out somehow. I have a few options in dating. Ive dated some nice guys but never felt that kind of attraction to them though.
I do sign up for a few hangouts where I know there will be new guys but Id talk to them once and never again so okc is fine right now"
4128,isfp,"Lol I looked at their post history and they frequent just about every mbti subreddit 
I can understand selfishness though, as a Fi user I am quite selfish. He has parents that might be authoratative so that might be part of why. I heard his dad was yelling at him while he was learning how to drive. 
He can get angry at some of his family members too but then he gets over it quickly. Its fine though everyone, their mom, their dog they all have strengths and weaknesses. He rarely gets angry at me, must be because Im not that close to him. Once I got angry at him but then he apologized and I got over it. 
One other weakness he has is that he is terrible at texting. He is way better at talking to someone in person but he usually just texts one liners and not lenthy paragraphs like Ne users do? Is this a Ne vs Se thing? "
4129,isfp,"Hi there‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry I haven‚Äôt been answering. 
I think he‚Äôs probably a type 9 isfp, which is problematic bc it means he stores his anger until he explodes. I know bc I have type 9 sister and ex. Type 9 also depend on group harmony for inner peace. 
I think so. I think it‚Äôs also Ne vs Ni. Ni likes to get to the core while Ne kind of dances around the core. (But still I wish I had Ne instead of Ni bc it seems more practical in many cases.) "
4130,isfp,"Feelings of inferiority and superiority lead to so much pain and suffering in the world. We all possess a thinking intellect, and we all feel emotions, and categorizing individuals in terms of MBTI will often lead to feeling either better or worse off than another person. 
We all perceive with our 5 senses. All of us use intuition. We all think, and we all feel. We are all introverts and extroverts at times, depending on a number of factors, such as how well understood we are by others, and what our goals are in life. All of us are on time at times, and we are all late at times. We are all organized and planning at times, and we are all spontaneous at times. 
The core of all of us ‚Äì our eternal minds ‚Äì share all of the higher feeling emotions and knowledge of reality. Basically, when we die, we all know the same shit, and we all feel incredibly awesome. There is no pain in the spiritual plane. There is only constant humor and constant vitality. Deep down, at our core, we are all immortal and eternal, and we all share the same feelings and the same knowledge.
On the physical plane, we are all playing out roles for the purposes of evolution. We all have a unique purpose that is valuable and serves humanity in some way. We must see it this way ‚Äì the truth ‚Äì in order to evolve quickly. All of the lighter and kinder feelings are in appreciation of one another, and not in competition with each other. 
Some of us are really good at mathematics, others are fantastic doctors, some are excellent poets, and some are mechanically inclined. MBTI can be refined to see unique purpose and specialization in one another as individuals, rather than for purposes of seeing ourselves better or worse off than others in relation to personality typing. 
There is a common belief that NTs, for instance, are superior thinkers, and the NFs are too emotional and do not possess higher thinking capabilities in relation to NTs. This is entirely inaccurate. There are many NFs that engage the intellect just as easily as NTs do. Also, NTs are just as emotionally sensitive as NFs are. All individuals have buttons that can be pushed; we all feel pain from time-to-time that others may cause us. 
It‚Äôs good to see how we are all alike, rather than how we are all different, so that we can grow together psychically.  It is when we try to emotionally dominate each other that more pain is caused. Every time we look down on another human being, or look down on ourselves when we compare ourselves to another human being, we are creating more emotional pain. Our bodies are localized within specific points in space/time, but our thoughts and emotions are not. Our minds, emotional states, and the feelings we all share are NON-LOCAL in nature. When we think about another person, we share feelings with that person. Our attitude towards another person will determine what they feel from us. We must acknowledge this truth so that we can be more aware of how we think about each other. 
There really are no psychopaths or empaths in this reality. There is only expression of pain or expression of joy. When we appreciate one another, we express joy. When we cut ourselves off from other people emotionally, and possess a cold, uncaring and ruthless attitude towards other people, we are often seen as psychopaths. But what this really is, deep down, is the expression of fear, anger, hatred and emotional immaturity.
All of us are empathic and psychic. All of our minds are eternal. We can all communicate telepathically with the deceased. There is no death. We are all immortal. Pay very close attention to your thoughts and emotions, and specifically emotional connectivity, and you will quickly see that we are all telepathic. We all sense the attitudes and thoughts of each other, and when we silence our minds and listen; we can also perceive the thoughts others are having. It is quite amazing. This is all observation here. I have observed these things personally, and so have you.
We are in the midst of a psychic and telepathic revolution. The less phony we are, the more we tell the truth about what we are experiencing, and the more in control we are of our thoughts, the faster we will grow in awareness. When we are kind and honest with each other, there is never a reason to be phony.

4131,isfp,"I'll abstain from commenting on your metaphysics.
MTBI is fundamentally about functional preferences or habits, not capabilities. Just because I prefer to get my energy from internal doesn't mean I'm incapable of getting it from external sources. Similarly, just because I prefer to gather information from facts (s) rather than intuitively doesn't mean that I'm incapable of it. Anyone who thinks that one type is better than another is just being silly at best and an ass at worst.
Similarly, I may tend to make decisions based on values (F) or based primarily on logic (T), this doesn't have to deal with whether I'm ""in touch with my feelings"" or ""analytical"". I can analytically determine that certain actions are in accordance with values, or I can ""trust my gut"" that a certain action isn't coherent or doesn't make sense.
How we relate to others is a very important question, but it's not necessarily tied totally to a tool like MBTI.
""I try to use MBTI for understanding and influencing myself, not for labeling others."""
4132,isfp,"Hey, don't worry about it. MBTI really isn't about superiority and there's a lot out there who recognize that (while yeah, there are others who still don't).
If there's one thing  I'd attempt to contradict though, it's that it's too focused on us being similar and not much recognition/attention on our differences that the whole of it may seem less grounded, and frankly more difficult to take at face value.
Course, if you think otherwise, feel free to disagree."
4133,isfp,"I doubt anyone has a favorite song. I know my favorite music changes based on my mood. I have been loving these playlists that keep being dropped on here.

4140,isfp,"At work. Will listen to this the moment I get home though.
Edit: Home now. Love it! I feel like some of the power is lost when listening to anime music though since I haven't seen the anime.
My favorite anime song might be Full Metal Alchemist Opening 2. That or literally anything in the JoJo's series since it reminds me of the anime.
Edit 2: I was wrong. I Fucking love The King's Plan from No Game No Life. Don't care for the anime, but that song is a masterpiece. I tear up when I listen to it. It just speaks to me somehow."
4141,isfp,"Gotta admit this took me by surprise. Every song I had listened to up till this point was slow. Wasn't prepared for that. I tend to dislike this kind of metal. I think I would like it more if I could make out what each noise was in the background. It just sounds like a dull roar to me.
I do like the roaring kind of singing though. Its unique to this kind of music."
4142,isfp,Thought it was ending. It had two more minutes. This may be the best new song I have listened to from this thread. Granted my mood may just match to this better at the moment than the others. Nonetheless glad I decided to ask this cause it lead me to this.
4143,isfp,"I just didn't want a million songs to have to listen to cause I planned to go through this whole thing if it didn't fucking blow up. You can put more than one if you want to <3

4144,isfp,"Haha that's why I can't just pick one, lemme try do one from each decade:
1960s - Ain't mountain high enough
1970s - Mr Blue Sky
1980s - Human Nature
1990s - Kiss from a rose
2000s - dancing in the moonlight (yes I know it was released in 1999 but oh well)
2010s - Stressed out
2018 - Lucid Dreams
Favourite Rap song - No Role Modelz
Favourite Anime Opening - Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood Opening 2
I still feel like I'm cheating on a lot of songs... "
4145,isfp,"yeah it's a bit different. a big part of black metal is the distortion, IMO it sort of adds an atmosphere to the music. I was never into black metal, but this style works for my tastes and kind of got me more into other black metal bands. not sure if it's my favorite song, but it's one I listen to a lot lately"
4146,isfp,"Listened to all of it. Had already heard most of it though. Just an excuse to listen to them again. Not sure how I hadn't heard stressed out yet. Its got a billion and a half fucking views lol.
Two things: 1: That opening from Brotherhood is amazing. Loved that anime too. 2: This is a dope rap remix you should hear "
4147,isfp,"Hmmm. Upon a second listening. This song is every bit as slow as the others. Maybe slower. I was just too focused on the distortion (or as I said ""Dull Roar"") Its just more intense. The sounds are just heavier. ......I think I understand heavy metal now
Edit: Minds a bit blown right now. Not sure how I hadnt noticed this sooner."
4148,isfp,"Pop music? Alternative Rock I guess. Maybe its called Punk Rock though. Not sure. Blink 182, Three Days Grace, Recently gotten into a lot of electronic music. Im a sucker for anything with a Banjo. Think I have grown tired of Metallica every time a song of theirs starts and then one minute into it im doing an electric guitar and head banging. Listen to some rap (mainly eminem because the mans a rap god, rap god) Is disney music a style? Love covers of older songs. Hard to claim a genre or style when almost genre has a lot of great music. I like country but I think so many country songs lyrics are really fucking stupid. Really like bluegrass (banjos). Dont much care for heavy metal honestly though there are some damn good songs that fall under that classification. Favorite group is Ninja Sex Party. Not sure saying all this will help or hurt. Ill just stop there before I write another paragraph. I dont really have a style :(
Edit: Punk Rock. Go with that. Sorry. I talk too much."
4149,isfp,"For something similar check out Uada, Batushka, and Plaga - I think Batushka or Mgla are the best of those, but they are all a bit unique. 
I listen to a lot of thrash metal too, which is generally faster and as heavy as black metal. Toxic Holocaust - Acid Fuzz is a pretty good one I go back to a lot. I used to listen to calmer ambient stuff, but heavy metal works better for lifting weights and just helps me be more productive in general. Ambient is probably better for reminiscing and overthinking shit like I used to"

4151,isfp,"Alright. I'm pretty good at being my carefree, weird self when I'm in the right mood to socialize or when I've warmed up to someone. BUT for some reason when I have a big crush on someone I kind of shut down when I talk to them and everything feels awkward and like I'm pushing them away or don't like them? This really happens when there are other people around and the person I have feelings for approaches me... does this happen to anyone else? Ugh. I'll send a text like ""hey can we talk after such and such event?"" and then when they approach me at the event asking what I wanted to talk about I'm like ""oh, that was really nothing..."" like ?!? wtf me?! Then, when we hang out alone eventually I warm up to talking to them and everything is fine and I can be myself again and have a great time. I feel like I'm giving really mixed signals and I'm worried I'm going to push them away.
does this happen to anyone else? How did you fix it??"
4152,isfp,You're putting too much pressure on yourself and putting them on a pedestal. You don't know them well enough so obviously you are idealizing a perfect version of them. Realize they have plenty of flaws just like all of us and stop thinking about them too much..in create some weird fantasies in our heads. 
4153,isfp,"Hi ISFP friends I‚Äôm back! Just curious as to what y‚Äôall do in your free time! I‚Äôm back on a self-care kick and am trying to find new things to do to, hobbies to take up, just to switch things up and not be so comfortable!
I bartend and serve for work, spend time hiking, watching tv, and mainly drinking with friends."
4154,isfp,"no one mentioned any sports so far, how come?? I rock climb and boulder a lot.
also, reading books, playing DnD, worldbuilding, currently painting a lot of digital maps for said worldbuilding, haha.
I like to play Marathon games of Civ V. "
4155,isfp,"I play PC games (mostly Dota 2) and watch youtube vids, mostly about new pc/console games that look nice, sport higglights, food preparation. Then I use to do sport but recently moved and still finding a place to do that. But I mean it all depends how I feel. "
4156,isfp,"Lately I‚Äôve been trying to find new hobbies and I‚Äôve been getting into making sweets and jewelry. I also really like makeup/fashion, trying new things & seeing new places, & of course hanging with friends."
4157,isfp,"I'm in gradschool and newly married with a part time job to supplement our income. So not much (any) free time. 
I look forward to the days where I can backpack again, or play videos games, or knit and binge watch the office. "
4158,isfp,"Oh wow, awesome and good on you for getting in some self care!  For me, on weekdays I have work, but after work I go to the gym to do some classes like body combat etc just to feel generally healthier haha!
On the weekends, if I don't have plans with friends, I'm at home relaxing and watching youtube, netflix etc or even exercising if I had missed the gym haha!
Sometimes, I get bored of that and visit my friend who lives quite close to me and play Nintendo Switch with them, or spend time with them by watching movies etc.
Other times, I have moods where I feel like going out, so after work on Friday I go out with workmates for drinks and dancing :)
All in all, not too exciting weekend I would say, but actually love the balance of both being alone and being with friends :)"
4159,isfp,"I travel and like to make short documentaries just for the fun of it, or I like to do photography. I also love food and going to new restaurants for me is amazing, trying out the new food especially in new countries!"

4161,isfp,"I'm developing an MBTI test but to do this I'll need some people to add to a Discord server, mostly to test questions I may add to the test. If anyone would like to participate you can join the Discord server here:
https://discord.gg/Q6zjrTd "
4162,isfp,My job is primarily on the phone and today someone commented that I was speaking 'garbled.' My co-worker said they were likely not listening to me/had no idea what I was talking about but I have had a family member mention I speak to fast/mutter sometimes. I don't see myself as speaking that way and I don't know if it's something that can be corrected? How can I speak to people in a less confusing way without babying them? 
4163,isfp,"I've noticed people very often, if not always, tend to ask ""what?"" after I've said something, I don't know if it's the tone or volume of my voice, there just might be something in the way I speak that I'm not aware of. I've had people get confused, more than once, about the message I'm trying to get across and it tends to be frustrating to me too. It also sounds normal to me when I'm saying it. It often requires conscious effort from me to use my voice louder so that others can hear it. I wonder if it's the side effect of being such a withdrawn person. We're doing voice exercises where I'm studying right now actually, so I hope that helps me with speaking more clearly to others."
4164,isfp,"I'm pretty obsessive in rating stuff, I also keep a list for everything (rateyourmusic for music and movies, anilist for anime, backloggery for games)
I try to cut it a bit back for music, though, since I listen to so much and I change my opinion on music all the time."
4165,isfp,Yes actually my colleague commented that I am very detailed and it's funny for them. If I like or dislike something I'll fully explain why and how that thing could be improved lmao. Makes me think I could be a great critic (food preferably ;) l
4166,isfp,"I used to with films, mostly to get recommendations. But now if someone tells me i'll like something, i'm inclined to not like it! a catch-22. (but there is a part of me that likes sorting things).  
it's easier to just keep track of directors/musicians i like, and let serendipity, forums, whatever, fill in the rest."
4167,isfp,"Yea and the rating kind of goes like this. 
This is so good I wonder what was on their mind when they made this. 
This is pretty great but I have a few ideas how to make it even better. 
I dont dislike it. 
There are a few good parts but the rest are dreadful. 
What the hell were they thinking when they made this?"
4168,isfp,"I feel like I'm too impulsive in almost every aspect, like i live in autopilot. I feel like spend so much time lost inside my head that I'm not really aware of anything. I can't really remember things clearly, like what I said or what i seen and heard, only an abstract idea of what happened.
I feel like I'm acting on impulse all the time. I dont think before I speak or before I buy something or make decisions. Sometimes, it saves me time, effort and some concerns I don't need, but sometimes (lots of them) they also bring me bad consequences. For example, I realized I'm an impulsive liar. Not all the time, but in some situations where I feel pressured or just only on the bad consequences of telling the truth, I just lie. I know that lying will bring worse consequences in the future, but I do it out of impulse to avoid immediate conflict.
Well, that was one example of how my impulsivity is bringing bad consequences to my life right now, but there are many others. I just want to be more aware of what I say, what I think and what I feel, instead on living in autopilot while I hide in the back of my brain.
Do any of you experience the same thing?  Is it just me or is it an ISFP problem? 
And how to deal with it? I think therapy would help, but it's not a viable solution right now.
TL;DR: I am an impulsive liar, procrastinator and money spender. How to be more aware of my actions and think before acting? How to stop living in autopilot?"
4169,isfp,"Lol, are you me. I think exactly like you, except I don't know if I lie that much, I just try to pull out a vague idea that's in the back of my brain whenever someone asks me a question about myself. I live a lot inside my head too, it's just that my thoughts are hard to translate to people (and I don't think they're that much special anyway). I forget a lot of stuff too. There's too much shit going on inside my brain to properly listen to people sometimes. Sometimes when I listen to people, I forget what they said right away as I'm focusing on the next thing then remember it and reflect upon it later when I'm alone. 
Often it's just me living my life, thinking about my thoughts and flaws and trying to find ways to improve, finding them but having no drive to. I do try to be mindful of things but they often slip away, leaving me with the bad consequences. I think scheduling/organizing your life bit by bit can help at least somewhat. But don't get too stressed about it either if it's something outside your control. Enjoy life."
4170,isfp,"yes, and i've also been told my distress tolerance is too high/i ""just let people walk all over me."" i see a grain of truth to this but i think it's more that other (mostly high Je-valuing) people are unnecessarily attached to what they expect/want vs. what happens in reality and they label any sort of momentary lapse in interpersonal paranoia as ""disrespect"""
4171,isfp,"That's the bad side to me being laid back, lol. It's gotten to the point where outside of thinking about the future or social situations with people I hate, I basically never feel stress anymore. Which is nice sometimes but now I'm trying to keep my final English mark from being a 65 when for most of my time in high school 90-95 was my average."
4172,isfp,"How are you doing, ISFPs? Spill your guts, some highs and lows, tell us anything about your day or week or month or whatever. Sometimes I like the idea of us being a little community, since there are so few of us compared to most other mbti groups, but I know that we ISFPs can be very reluctant talkers and I don't want to overwhelm anyone :P
In typical ISFP style, I feel nervous initiating conversation and might delete this sometime in the next 24 hours XD"
4173,isfp,"I feel unhappy and unsatisfied with myself, my friendships and where my life is headed (which is nowhere in particular right now). I don't think the people around me/the people that I'm supposedly closest to quite want the best for me, and a lot of this really messes me up but I'm not one to tell them or anyone how I feel. Showing lots of people how I really feel isn't my thing, but fuck it it's the internet I'll do what I want."
4174,isfp,"Currently going through a tight squeeze as I'm getting ready to transition to my final quarter of classes before graduating university with my BA degree. I may or may not make it out with my minor since I added it on last minute, but regardless I'm so ready to graduate! It's also a bad stretch of time to start a part time job soon since I'll be so busy until graduation, but here's to hoping I won't suffer too badly haha."
4175,isfp,"I'm 22 male in college, this is my spring break. We are putting down my dog tomorrow and then I'm getting knee surgery on Tuesday. It's getting scoped to remove two bone fragments and I'm scared I will die during surgery or will make it and be miserable and in pain for a long night time after. I also have ADHD, anxiety and depression and I'm worried about that flaring up. I'll be at home with my abusive family and am worried about taking care of myself because I probably won't get any help from them. It's going to be a rough week, I'll be mourning my dog while recovering from surgery and will probably be pretty depressed, miserable and upset and frustrated with the whole situation. I'll probably be feeling suicidal again but will try to get through it. Sorry about being a downer but that's me I guess "
4176,isfp,"Lifes been pretty hard recently. I have a job on the other side of the country (USA) from my family and girlfriend (we have been dating 2 years before my move) and she can't move out here because she is getting her masters. Its been about 8 months and her and I seem to argue a lot more than we used to. She has been out here to visit me and I have visited her but its still very hard. We both know I will be proposing fairly soon, but I asked for her fathers blessing and he said ""no, not yet"" to me which has made things extra hard. "
4177,isfp,"Well...where do I start? Life sucks but I'm getting by. The highlights being my best friend and closest confidant died (my dad) so I moved back in with my disabled mom. Then I lost my job (due to the economy) and decided to take an online course to get some formal training (mostly because I've bullshitted my way through life up until now and figure it's about time to get some education) only to have my computer crash. So I'm fatherless, jobless, and computerless all within the last 4 months or so. Go me.
On the bright side - my mom and I have gotten a lot closer. We are better understanding each other which is important for any mother daughter relationship. I didn't like my job much anyways and had been looking into other things for a while now. Being laid off has given me a rare opportunity to do what I want to do for work instead of whatever is availavble at the time. And as for the computer issue, mine was getting old and wasn't what I wanted from the beginning so I went and got a new one with all the specs and features I need/want. 
All in all - things are pretty good. "
4178,isfp,"Well I'm in this weird place of life. I'm finishing my studies (getting diploma probably around june/july). I have strongly mixed feelings about my work, talked with my boss about it and we will see what will happen. Watched a lot of ""stan the moto man"" and I'm jealous of life in Vancouver and wonna get motobike badly. Soon gonna spend a lot of money for my braces. Not happy about spending money, but my teeth need that. Just random stuff."
4179,isfp,"Graduating college was like the greatest moment of my life, only because school was more stressful for me than any job.... it's so nice not having homework anymore, I can just go home from work and not have to think for the rest of the day :D"
4180,isfp,"Oh nooooo!!!!! How did your knee fracture? How old is your dog? Try not to connect your dog's mortality with your own!! 
Maybe you can find some good shows to watch to occupy your recovery time. I know sometimes a funny show is the only way to get my mind off of things when I'm down. Have you watched the Office? Parks and Rec? Scrubs? Psych? Those ones always make me smile. "
4181,isfp,"Something that helped me with motivation was I got a long term membership (like 6 months) to the gym I go to so that I am locked in and feel like I am wasting my money if I don't go there every day. After a while, you start to recognize progress you are making and it becomes addictive. "
4182,isfp,"Yess I can't wait to feel liberated from school worries, at least for a while! Sure there's always the fear of what lies beyond graduation, but I'm a pretty simple person and would be happy just being able to earn a modest income and have time to enjoy my hobbies :)"
4183,isfp,"About four years ago when I was in high school, I was playing indoor soccer on a free day (I could have just sat on a bench but I didn't) I went from standing on my right leg to my left and my knee went sideways and I dislocated my kneecap, partially tore my MCL and fractured my tibia. I did physical therapy and recovered in a few months. I still had pain and the occasional locking up of my knee and saw a orthopedic doctor and she ordered another MRI. We found 2 bone fragments in my knee which were catching and causing sharp pains. Then I met with a surgeon who said we could scope my knee and remove the fragments. I will be doing that on Tuesday, then I will be on crutches for a few days and then I should be able to walk and then I will do physical therapy again to rehab my knee. I should start to notice positive changes in 4-6 weeks. 
My dog is 10 and has a large growth on his face which has made him blind in one eye and it's affecting his other eye now. He also seems to be having trouble breathing and sometimes blood leaks out of his nose. 
My therapist thinks I think I will die because I didn't talk to my mothers for almost a year and then she died before we talked again. So she thinks it's because I will be going under and not making contact with people while I'm out and that I think something really bad will happen because I'm not making contact and am surrendering control. 
I bought groceries for myself for while I'm recovering and have been stockpiling movies to watch while I'm recovering. "
4184,isfp,"I was working for a construction company in the Information Technology department. I handled all of the cell phones and mobile Internet platforms throughout the company (troubleshooting, travel plans, (de)activations, billing, etc.). Dealing with some 1400 individuals and 1900 devices kept me very busy. 
However, they decided that someone else with a full plate already could take over my full plate as well and get rid of me to save money. Excellent strategy if I do say so myself - good way to keep up the already lacking customer service in our team as a whole. Just brilliant rolls eyes"
4185,isfp,I'm one of those people that has a membership I don't often use 
4186,isfp,"A few days of crutches won't be so bad :) at least you will be able to move yourself around! That is the furthest thing from dying, you goof :)
I'm very sorry about your dog and your mother :(  hang in there, man! Time heals all wounds!"
4187,isfp,"I still keep in contact with my mates there and they are beyond pissed at the work load and the new boss is an ass. I honestly couldn't be happier now that I'm gone. Almost exactly a year before my dad passed, the same company laid him off too for no reason other than ""we can give this job to someone else for cheaper"". Where is a 55 year old man supposed to start a new career? Absolutely ridiculous. "
4188,isfp,"Do you find yourself finding practical solutions under stress that you wouldn't have found otherwise? 
Example:
Today I had bought a train ticket to my hometown (I study in another city). Before I left, I recalled that my mother had asked me to bring her glasses and my little brother's coat that they forgot at my sister's place, which is located in another district of the same city.
As I was leaving, I calculated the time that it would take me to take the forgotten things from my sister's place and from there, to the railway station. Well, it wasn't enough so I decided to change the ticket to another one that was 2 hours later (with a small fee). I went back home, ate a bit (I was hungry and I forgot to take some food with me.) I decided to take my time with it. 
When I was ready to leave the second time, I calculated the time again (with a navigator app, I find it pretty reliable), and I found that I wouldn't make it yet again (or I would miss with a few minutes). Then I realized, I could message my sister to ask her to bring the things to the railway station herself! Then it would save me considerable time that way and I wouldn't have to panic. So I did. Thoughts? Have you noticed something like this about yourself (in stress situations) as well? I know we ISFPs are usually spontaneous and in the moment, sometimes without planning things that well, but I think we can sometimes find practical solutions out of nowhere when being under enough stress. "
4189,isfp,"Sup, i'm graduating this semester and i already work at it.
It was really hard when i started, maths was a nightmare. Everyone says ISFP is bad for this type of stuff but i really think that putting some effort into it you can do anything and at some point be better than others.
Let's say, it was hard to me to start and understand new things, but now that i know all that i mastered all the basics i'm pretty good at it, i'm one of the highest notes of my class.
Sorry for the poor english"
4190,isfp,Still haven't gotten to actually take a programming class (going back to school) but I do love me some computers so I'll let you know in a couple of years lol. Good luck fellow ISFP computer sciencey person 
4191,isfp,"I am 17 but I love programming. Doing websites for some time now, few years and it is great. You listen to your music while your brain is @100% thinking, imagining what is actually happening, learning. You can be some-way-creative in your code, there are plenty ways how to do specific thing. Your apps can be small in code and great meaning some people can appreciate your work you are doing. You can apply your ~~aesthetics~~ in UI design. Only ""hobby"" where I found my flow.
This year I am taking computing technologies class - C and fundamentals. Greatest thing for me is that you do not have to hard-learn a lot of things, mostly it is just common sense, logic and a fuckton of Google :-)"
4192,isfp,"I'm an ISFP, and am quite interested in computer science.
Currently planning to study computer science in college, likely going to focus more on the cybersecurity and/or programming side of things.
I've done great in CS related classes, I guess I'm just naturally skilled at that sort of stuff."
4193,isfp,"Computer Science was my intended major for a while in undergrad. It's what my brother did and I liked a lot of similar things so I figured I would give it a shot.
The positives for me where that I really really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. There was a big thrill around working out a bug that I'd been tracking and working on for hours and finally having everything compile appropriately, and I wasn't used to feeling this sense of accomplishment after finishing an assignment in other subjects. I also loved learning the basic principles behind computer logic, encryption, network connections, etc, these were things that I wondered about, but didn't know how to start learning about them. I don't know much, but it satisfied my curiosity. The final thing that made it enjoyable was that I like learning languages, and about how they work. I'm no pro at learning to speak a foreign language, but I always had a thing for linguistics and picking up small details and common traits, and I liked comparing what I knew about human languages to that which speaks to machines. Again, I'm not great at any of this, but I'm describing what I liked.
The downside was that none of it was intuitive to me. I'm an extremely visual and hands on learner, and it was very difficult for me to figure out the math behind it, as well as picturing abstract concepts that are so necessary all around, such as in how the data is stored, how the language communicates to the OS or whatever at lower levels than what I worked with, etc. I ended up having to stalk my Uni for empty classrooms so I could try to draw out my entire program across the chalk boards as I was writing it so I wouldn't get lost. The most difficult part for me came later when they introduced us to GUIs. Being so visual and yet failing so hard at making a visual interface for my program was the most frustrating thing I have experienced in a course.
Ymmv of course, but this was my experience. So while I do not regret taking all those courses thanks to those positive things I did learn, overall I did not enjoy it. I ended up finishing my school in another direction after a while because I simply could not continue"
4194,isfp,"I'm ISFP borderline ISTP.  I started out in Electrical Enginnering, spent almost 4 years there before switching to CS.  Finally graduated after 8 years total in school.  Been in the industry for around 10 years now.  It's great, I love what I do. 
Math was never a problem for me, but calc 2 pushed me beyond what was enjoyable.  Core CS classes were great as long as I got good teachers who didn't micromanage.  Some of the generals were a drag (ethics, technical writing) but some were quite interesting (geology, psychology).
Today I'm a backend developer.  I mostly write APIs.  I used to say, ""My apps are like my woodworking, ugly but very functional"".  But I don't believe that's true anymore.  I really enjoy writing a 'beautiful' well documented API, and I am putting an absurd number of hours into a beautiful new herringbone kitchen table. "
4195,isfp,"I‚Äôm majoring in computer science, and I love it. I took computer science for three years in high school and now this is my second semester taking it in college. To me, Computer Science is my way of expressing myself because I have complete control over what happens in the program. I know it can‚Äôt do what I don‚Äôt tell it to do, and it becomes fun when I try to figure out where I told it the wrong thing to do. "
4196,isfp,"Good to know it. After all we're cousins with INTJ and as both ISFP and INTJ grow older it's quite hard to distinguish them apart so it shouldn't come as surprise if we excelled at it. After all we're given the ""Composer"" archetype
Btw how did you motivate yourself to do start it?"
4197,isfp,"I was already doing websites and started thinking that i don't want to deal with clients any longer and that programmers earn way more money. That plus people telling me i couldn't do it.
I don't know if it's good but anger motivates me a lot, lol. Now i don't even care to be honest"
4198,isfp,"My school had a college of general studies and apparently all of the different subjects and half-assed attempts at graduating under one major were able to be lumped into one sum ""science"" degree. The big ending was that I took an EMT course in my final semester, and it turned me around. EMS is the only thing that I ever really fell in love with, and while it sucks that it took me years at an expensive university to discover that, I'm happy it happened."
4199,isfp,"Like thinking about them All The Time. I took a good year off dating to focus on myself after my last relationship and got to a good place - self sufficient and generally happy. Got back in the game recently and met someone who checks all the boxes.. all of a sudden they're on my mind all the time, next comes the insecurity and self doubt, then the awkwardness that will push them away. 
Anyone have any advice? Trying to trick my brain with distractions and self affirmations but it's a losing battle."
4200,isfp,"Yes this happens a lot to me. Like you idealize that person, it's not even based in reality, it's your fantasy of the perfect partner. I don't know how to stop the obsession but you should understand manifestation and that actively desiring it repels it away. Act/believe/have the attitude that you already have all the things you want. It's kinda crazy but it shifts your mindframe and might make you feel better. Also, if you're feeling doubts/insecure about a romantic interest, I would just leave it alone. Your potential partner should want you just as much as you want them and shouldn't make you feel insecure about it, but reassure you and provide the affection and love us ISFPs can so easily provide."
4201,isfp,"Not even a love interest but a friend interest will take up a lot of my thoughts. I'll go in with such confidence and then worry that I will start pushing them away with my obsessive nature - which in turn can seem stand offish, it's a real struggle to make new, close friends. "
4202,isfp,"Always. Not even that new anymore and im still obsessing. Trick is to find someone that obsesses over you as well. Hahaha. No it helps if you know that they are obsessed and tgus intern want you to feel the same they do, which you do so its all good. Anyway I know its hard and I always just embraced that part of me and if that pushed tge other person away you should reevaluate and decide if it is really worth the emotional effort. Never change! Feel passionate! Its not abnormal. "
4203,isfp,i know i definitely don‚Äôt make a big effort to maintain friendships if they‚Äôre not that big for me but at the same time i don‚Äôt get why people complain that i never contact them because they never contact me either so can people stop making it like it‚Äôs not a 2 people issue
4204,isfp,"It‚Äôs just an obligatory social formality. Something that (fake) people say to ease what they perceive as tension in the moment because they cannot comprehend that some people really, truly have no problem with solitude.
So to keep from feeling awkward about not reaching out more, they say dumb shit like, ‚Äúomg it‚Äôs been FOREVER! We should TOTALLY hang out more, why don‚Äôt you ever call me?!‚Äù and then we nod and smile, knowing we won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs all a dumb charade."
4205,isfp,"True to that! People who do this are playing a dirty game, trying to put us in a guilty position.
I would tell them that next time you miss me, don't wait up for me calling you, you can call me too you know! So why didn't you?"
4206,isfp,"Literally though... Then I go out of the way to make plans but they're never free, they flake, or ghost my messages. 
cool cool cool... fucc me right
These are closer ""friends"" too, not i-ran-into-you-in-the-hallway friends."
4207,isfp,"then you get the old-friends-turned-social-climbers, who will stared blankly past you if  there's someone cooler in the room, yet will come and hug you (and I'm not ok with unwanted contact) and tell you how much they ""miss you"" when there's nobody better to talk to. I haven't had a conversation with you in 6 months! Go away! "
4208,isfp,"So, I know that basing relationships off of type is absolutely incorrect and I can assure you I‚Äôm not too bothered. However I would just like some other experiences to gain a better understanding of what may be right for me.
Basically, I‚Äôm talking to an ESFP rn. Classic ESFP. Super flirty, absolute party animal. Which at first really bothered me as I was like ‚Äúyehh this won‚Äôt really work as anything more than friends‚Äù. However; I‚Äôve felt myself really falling for her and I can tell she‚Äôs interested in me, by the looks of it more than she is in other people. She‚Äôs actively cut things down with people, became much less flirty with others and tried to gain my attention much more.
One of the things which drew me in was her making a super nice personalised birthday gift for a friend. It made me so happy that someone who on the outside may seem superficial and flirty, had such a genuine core and wanted to make someone close so happy. 
My only real worry is of course; them being unable to truly commit and that she‚Äôll get bored and move on. Stereotypically it‚Äôs apparently what they do and even personally, I can kinda see it in her.
Which is why I‚Äôm stuck. In my head I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat if this is just some superficial relationship which won‚Äôt truly mean anything or last‚Äù. However at the same time I do get on really well with her and I can see a lot coming from it. I don‚Äôt know. It feels almost like I know that I could be getting myself into a relationship I‚Äôll regret, but it seems so stupid to get rid of an opportunity based off an assumption with no evidence. Idk whether to go off my instinct or just stop overthinking and enjoy where it takes me. I‚Äôll leave it a bit longer to really understand and I promise I won‚Äôt make a decision based off her type; but any experiences or opinions you have on the matter would be much appreciated!"
4209,isfp,"If you like her then just jump right in and find out for yourself if this will work. The main problem I see will probably be exhaustion on your end, but even that may not happen to you. Worst comes to worst, you break up and you're essentially back where you started."
4210,isfp,My experience with ESFPs is that we fall hard and fast for each other and then eventually burn out and go our own separate ways. Transition happens almost seamlessly and the feelings are mutual. Parting is amicable and left open to interpretation/follow ups which may or may not ever occur.
4211,isfp,"they really aren't meant for us.  and you both will burn out quickly.
it would be hard to keep this up long-term because both types are ""carefree"" types. 
both types are known to be super caring and loyal until they simply don't feel like it and seek their own satisfaction."
4212,isfp,"I would suggest give it a crack. Don't overthink what might happen because yeah it might end up superficial but how do you know for sure without trying? Plus don't read too much into the mbti compatibility stuff, people can have long successful relationships with their least compatible partner type... It's more about personal compatibility over thinking styles."
4213,isfp,"Damn man, can‚Äôt thank you enough for this. It‚Äôs a perfect way to look at it. I did think I should just stop looking into it and do what I feel good with. I‚Äôll be sure to go into it with cautiousness but you‚Äôre right; I don‚Äôt have anything to lose. Would be a learning opportunity at the very least. This was the reassurance I was after - thanks again!"
4214,isfp,"I see - that does make a lot of sense. It‚Äôs already been a very fast, intense thing. But I guess the positive in that is that it isn‚Äôt really a bad thing. Which is why i guess I‚Äôll just go for it. If it ends, whatever. No harm done. I see it as almost a high stakes, with nothing to particularly lose situation. Really appreciate the comment!"
4215,isfp,"Hey, just thought I‚Äôd come back with an update.. on how absolutely spot on you were. Like god damn, to the point. I mean my intuition predicted the same but shhh we spoke about that...
Anyway I‚Äôll keep it quick as to not bother you but yeah it was perfect until she suddenly opened up about how much she likes me and how great she thinks I am, but how she isn‚Äôt a relationship person and doesn‚Äôt want to lead me on and hurt me. Which is very respectable and honest of her, I was very grateful.
It just struck me how well I handled it and how truly mutual it was. Perhaps because I was so prepared. I just managed to control the situation calmly, sort it and we‚Äôve both left feeling much better and honestly not all that hurt. Again, crazy how accurate you were about falling hard and fast but quickly burning out in a calm way. Hey, who knew your intuition was so good it predicted my future?? Thanks again :)"
4216,isfp,"Hmm I can see what you‚Äôre saying, and I‚Äôll keep it in mind. It hasn‚Äôt happened yet tho so there isn‚Äôt really much I can do; would be absurd to end things over type and the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù.
Though I will be more cautious and ready for it. So I appreciate your comment."
4217,isfp,"I appreciate it. I look for this kind of reassurance. Perhaps it‚Äôs kind of selective listening but eh, you‚Äôre exactly right. The only worries I have are it fading, but if I had no idea what mbti was, I probably wouldn‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs as much of a possibility? So making a decision based off it is absurd. It‚Äôs all going amazing so far so I can‚Äôt complain. A lot of people should remember your last sentence too. Thanks again!"
4218,isfp,"That also depends on the person. I'm 100% sure I'll never love an ENTP, because the very thing they are just doesn't work for me.
(I'm a bit more used to them lately now and I realize only the unhealthy ones are bad, but even then I tend to have awkward relations with the healthy ones)"
4219,isfp,"Glad I could help. üòÇ You and the ESFP probably bonded over mutual physical attraction and shared Se preferences but I imagine her flippant attitude about something we take very seriously (love) was enough of a turn-off to keep your disappointment at bay.
Also ESFP can seem like a clownish version of ourselves, at least to me. Like not as ‚Äúdeep‚Äù or serious/intellectual as I‚Äôd prefer. They probably find us too intense. Oh well. Glad you had a mediocre time, lol. Sure beats heartache anyway."
4220,isfp,"No worries, I too love a second opinion just to reassure myself. Also just a quote I love you might find helpful, ""Always expect the best but prepare for the worst"". I don't think you can go too wrong with that attitude with not just relationships but most things in life. However my track record with relationships has been pretty bad so idk lol!!!"
4221,isfp,"Exactly right. Though her carefree, flirty and fun attitude was very charming at first, it very quickly became superficial. I‚Äôd find myself happy in the day, but lie in bed at night just thinking ‚Äúeh, what am I doing‚Äù. Though of course it didn‚Äôt get to anything hugely serious so really no harm done. Not to mention the exhaustion I could already feel creeping up. Can already feel myself coming back. 
Though her honesty in how she handled it all and how much she cared was absolutely admirable. Perhaps we gotta hand the ESFPs something eh..ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I‚Äôm joking. No hard feelings. Thanks again :)"
4222,isfp,"Wow, I should really live my life by more quotes and sayings; that sounds like a great one! I think I sometimes follow that anyway though perhaps not enough. And don‚Äôt worry about it haha, only way to learn is to experience!"
4223,isfp,"I'm really into games so this'll be a long one:


The games I've played most: (I play neither of these anymore)


Garry's Mod - Loved different gamemodes for different reasons.  Lots of potential for freedom/creation/fun.


Or Minecraft - I always loved creative mode.  Messing with redstone, building houses, etc etc...




Singleplayer game I love to play with others: Skyrim - It's super fun to just explore, make moral (or amoral) choices, and goof around


Multiplayer game I love to play alone: Civilization 5 - I can never play it with friends because I like building singular ""cities on a hill"", full of everything awesome and good.  Then the other people take it :(


Game I love to hate: Dark Souls 2 - Really enjoy the atmosphere and the challenge, but can get incredibly frustrated by it.  Can't play it in long sessions or I might have a stroke...


Game I hate to love: Hearthstone - There's so much room to make neat decks with cool themes... then you try to play them and get crushed by a whole lot of the same.  Still addicted to the small amount of fun that gets through.


Favorite ""How do you define a game"" Game: The Stanley Parable


Favorite Game: Portal 2 - Holds a very special place in my heart. 

"
4224,isfp,Mostly anything where I'm given as much free reign as possible... over the story... in the world etc. But a plot has to be well developed and a good art style is welcomed. So titles would include Fallouts/Skyrim/Dishonoured/Anything by Telltale/ GTA on some days/ Heavy Rain (!!!) / La Noir etc
4225,isfp,"Any new telltale game, those are the only that I actually play through.
I think isfp would like Life is strange (maybe) but definetly try Child Of Light. it's amazing, also the first game ive played twice in years"
4226,isfp,"I notice often that I don't truly care when people compliment me for something, unless I personally strongly agree and believe it's right. Like, when I was a kid my drawing skills were highly praised but I thought (and still think) I suck at it so the compliments didn't do much for me.
However, criticism does always get my attention. Whether it's aimed at me or something I like, criticism always gets my attention. Especially when it's very mean-spirited and aimed at something I like, I really can't stand that. It's kinda annoying, I wish I could care less."
4227,isfp,"Yessss that's me! My mom is always showing off my work and I'm like whyyy this is embarrassing and try to be really modest about it. 
Then I might ask for criticism and I get upset by it cause I already probably did my best and thought it was good"
4228,isfp,"Yeah! I usually show people things I‚Äôve created in the hopes of getting something nice said about it but then when I do, I always feel super awkward and wonder why I wanted to hear that in the first place. "
4229,isfp,"It kind of feels like my character is being judged based on that criticism. 
For example, I've just started a new job about 6 months ago. I'm still in the learning stage. However, being in the learning stage means making a lot of mistakes and having all my work criticized...always. Each time, I am well aware that what they have to say is valid and will help improve my craftsmenship but I cant help but take it personally. I am immediately disappointed in myself for not being able to get it on the first try and I automatically believe they assume I'm completely useless and should be terminated. 
I know in my head it will take time to learn this job and my bosses are never mean about it, but I almost burst into tears Every. Single. Time. for not reason and with no explanation. My heart is hurt. My feelings are hurt. I'm sad. And I cant help it. I'm trying...I really am. But I cant seem to figure out how to push aside the feelings and focus on the good that will come out of having a proper attitude. "
4230,isfp,"I think constructive criticism is very valuable and important and I always want feedback on ways in which I can improve. I‚Äôm usually my own worst critic so I usually know what I did wrong or what I want to work on and when people validate my own opinion, I can take it. But regardless how useful or constructive it is, criticism on things I thought went well or criticism I wasn‚Äôt expecting can be absolutely soul crushing. "
4231,isfp,"This sounds like what I've experienced.  Some hurt feeling but maybe  determination to do better.  I accidentally commented that a friend sounded a little flat while she was singing.  There was some immediate negative feedback to me(ouch). But, soon after she tells me she is taking singing lessons.  And now is singing in a band.  Can't help but wonder if I caused all this action."
4232,isfp,I interact with isfps pretty regularly (work in design) and other than work it feels hard for me to connect with them. So I'm trying to understand how I'm viewed and work out some insecurities I have socializing with them
4233,isfp,"I'm ISFP and my boyfriend is INTJ. We are very different, but we work wonderfully together. He always says he has a hard time understanding what I'm thinking at times, and then I would get sad, because he didn't understand what I communicate with him (without words). But we can talk about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING, and that is why we work. Communication is the backbone of any relationship."
4234,isfp,"I find it hard to connect, despite wanting to. They've all ended up in disaster for me. I feel like I do nothing but compromise for them and they do nothing but take (they obviously don't see it that way, but I think the problem is the way they give doesn't resonate with ISFPs, so we don't recognize it).
edit: I'd like to add that I think we are both cautious around each other because our strengths are their weaknesses and vice versa. So it's hard to figure out the compatibility. If you want to feel closer to them, try being more open with your feelings and taking in the present moment vs. the future."
4235,isfp,I dont really connect with most of them at my work. I am strangly enough a scientist and also a ISFP. needless to say...I kinda choose the wrong education and line of work. I think the INTJ's think I am lazy.....and I am...but nobody should even consider thinking it or showing it to me..I take great offence if I find out they have any negative attitude with me being lazy. I'm cool with ppl telling me I'm lazy but they think its cool:) Then I love them:)
4236,isfp,Savage. Every INTJ I've come across has been incredibly blunt. I can tell they really dgaf lol. But I respect their drive and work ethic. They tend to be intelligent. I've never had the opportunity to get close to one though. 
4237,isfp,"About which part?
I get quite moody, and in the beginning, I might get upset if sometimes he doesn't understand my passions or spontaneity. But nonetheless, it is working out for us so far. Will we get married? And have kids? We just moved in together recently, so we have a lot to uncover about each other. We have similar goals and values, but who knows."
4238,isfp,"So, imagine you have a blog. And imagine you have friends, specially irl.
You feel like a part of you is there. Not because it is the most important thing for you, but because you feel comfortable to be who you are there.
Even though there is no big information about your personal life, you write on the blog about lot of things that you like.
IRL, you have no problem on telling your friends ""hey, I really like this or that"".
But... Would you show them your blog and posts? Would you send'em the link? If no, why not? If so, why?"
4239,isfp,"I kind of feel weird about that too. I just don't share it. Some things are really personal you know? Even the phrasing. Maybe you speak in some way in your blog, but another way to your friends. 
What's funny is that I can share shit with complete strangers, but feel weird with friends lol. "
4240,isfp,Not sure if it would be too personal to share or you're giving your friends too much credit that they would be interested in something like that? If someone offered for me to read their personal blog I would feel #1 obligated to do so #2 drained af #3 feel overloaded with that person and need to take a step back for a bit.
4241,isfp,Lol...I have an entire business that could be very relevant for a lot of people and I still don‚Äôt talk about it with my friends or family. I rarely tell anyone. It‚Äôs just awkward and horrible and I feel guilty for whatever reason when I do. 
4242,isfp,"I was just watching iceskating and one of the competitors was skating to music from Dr. Zhivago, and I remembered how when I was younger and that used to be my favorite movie and it made me cry back then. Kind of giggled about that. Then ON CUE when the song started playing tears came up to my eyes and i couldn't believe it, I had to stop putting on my makeup because the Dr. Zhivago theme was still making me cry even today. Is this normal? Do you have a song that gets to you? Not necessarily crying (I'm a cry monster) but that tugs at you? "
4243,isfp,"It doesn't make me cry, but both Soldier Side and Roulette by System Of A Down really get me every time. Soldier Side actually did make me cry a little once. I generally don't listen to sad songs though. The closest thing to a ""sad song"" band I listen to would be Syd Matters or Automatic Loveletter, but even them i wouldn't call sad. Except maybe Black Ink Revenge by AL."
4244,isfp,"I feel that unless I'm in an environment where I know the people and have a subject to talk about, I'm very quiet and awkward. I'm pretty charismatic, but not at first glance like I've seen it be described. I'm almost definitely overthinking this, but is it pretty normal to act like that?"
4245,isfp,"Uh, where did you read that? I guess ISFPs can be charismatic, but not in the same way as Fe users. Fe users can directly charm your pants off, but Fi users have a sort of attractiveness without trying. I swear that the senpai from the ‚Äònotice me senpai‚Äô memes, has got to be ISFP."
4246,isfp,"I'd say it honestly depends on how you grew up, I wasnt charismatic until I joined a fraternity which made me come out of my shell, before then I definitely came across as awkward more often than not. "
4247,isfp,"I wouldn‚Äôt say so. ISFPs charm your pants off by being mysterious. They have a gravitational attraction that pulls you in. It radiates from within. My take on it anyway. Being an Fe user, I‚Äôm just dorky and luckily most people seem to find it endearing üòÖ Got no pantsless charm. "
4248,isfp,"There‚Äôs nothing harder than trying to extricate myself from an ESFJ trying to sell me clothes, or trying to get me to go out with them. I have to seriously put my foot down in order to deny an ESFJ anything -and that not without feeling like a huge meanie after that. An ISFP won‚Äôt do that. I guess there‚Äôs a distinction between active and passive charm. Both are charming, nonetheless."
4249,isfp,"You have one too, OMG OMG üò±
Yeah I totally fangirl so many SP artists, but my ultimate fav is this one ISFP artist in my previous workplace. Totally amazing. He noticed me a couple times, and I went out to lunch with him once. Much excite! So amaze!"
4250,isfp,"I'm often very conscious of the space I'm in, whether it be somebody's home, a hospital, a car, I feel very affected by my environment.  I glance around at objects and features of the environment and sometimes reflect on how everything I see makes me feel. 
If I'm in a historical place I often think about what's gone down there, like who might have previously owned/occupied this space?  How many good memories were created here?  Did this bedroom once belong to a girl who liked to paint (because there wasn't any TV or internet in those days)?  How many adventures has this old car been on?  Has anyone lost their virginity on the back seat?
Perhaps this is something that ties in with our trait of appreciation for aesthetics and awareness of our environment.  Just a thought :)"
4251,isfp,"Definitely! I would go so far as to say that I get a weird feeling, too, that very specifically only happens when I'm in historical places. It's somewhere between being in awe and being creeped out. I call it ""feeling the ghosts"" in the place, although I don't actually think there are any ghosts. This often leads to me lingering for a long time, and if I'm with anyone they have to remind me to move along. I've tried explaining this feeling to others but usually they can't relate. "
4252,isfp,"I also do this. Who walked down this street, just yesterday? What were they doing? Strolling or trying to get somewhere or away from somewhere else? What about five years ago? Ten? Fifty? What did this street look like a hundred years ago? How were the houses, the people? What did they say, in their small, everyday lives that held no meaning except to themselves? Who did the girls have a crush on, who was the unattainable bachelor? Who did the boys like to think about in their 'alone time'? What gossip went on, about who? It comes and goes, but there are times when I get ridiculously sad, not only because I want to know the intricacies of these people's lives, but also because I will be one of them someday. There will be some person, wandering down the street, and they'll wonder who lived in my house. What my day was like, what I did to entertain myself.  "
4253,isfp,"I get really weird chills... I don't know how to describe the feeling. I just felt it last night, actually, when I was over at my friend's house and he was showing me some of his mom's cool antique bottles. I was holding one and thinking about how someone bought it, drank it, enjoyed it, and threw it away. What was that person doing when they were drinking it? What kind of mood were they in? They had a life, and I felt connected to it, however distantly... I got those deep down chills and had to put the bottle down and take a deep breath. Sometimes it hits me really hard. I feel it in historic places, too, sometimes a lot more intense."
4254,isfp,"Most tests I have taken show me as ISFP.  The test at 16personalities.com keeps saying I'm INFP.  
I found this nice comparison: http://www.personality-central.com/distinguishing-INFP-and-ISFP.html
After reading this I would say I lean more toward ISFP.
Here are their 3 points:


INFPs are much dreamier than the ISFPs who are simple and down-to-earth.


INFPs can enjoy theory while ISFPs often dislike the classroom setting.


INFPs are usually engaged in the arts while ISFPs are engaged in craft-related work.


It's an interesting read for anybody who was wondering the differences between INFP and ISFP."
4255,isfp,"Don't confuse the distinguishment between INFP and ISFP dreaminess. Both are profoundly distracted, absent-minded, and generally aloof. ISFP dreaminess, though, is generally focused on the external environment and what IS. For example, an ISFP individual may ruminate upon thoughts of a particular animal they found appealing,  or grow distracted by some flowers across a path. An INFP is more concerned with what could be, as well as the interrelationships between seemingly unrelated concepts. An INFP, then, would likely daze off into thoughts surrounding more abstract philosophies. Perhaps ponder the human impact on that particular bird we discussed earlier, and how that hindered or strengthened it's development. The daziness is similar, but dissonance arises in approach"
4256,isfp,"Thanks for sharing. I'm new here. I have taken the '16 personalities' test afew times and my results switch between ISFP and INFP. Reading your summary above, I identify with ISFP (down to earth, classroom setting isn't natural and I am very into practical creative things; woodwork, textiles etc)."
4257,isfp,"ISFPs are likely to come off slightly more 'agressive'/task oriented/'do-ers' because of their Se. They are much more in tune with the physical world. Like somebody mentioned below, they are also likely to be daydreamers, but are more prone to be thinking about something like a place, or a person, or an animal, or get distracted by something physical, whereas an INFP would be more likely to be exploring philosophies or abstract possibilities. Also, INFPs may come across as more consistent or having a 'theme' in the way they go about life, due to their Ne, whereas an ISFP will seem more likely to change their surroundings based on how they are feeling in the present moment."
4258,isfp,"Seems valid. Though, like all generalizations, there will be exceptions. And the line between arts and crafts gets blurry really fast. But it describes the differences between me and two ISFPs in my life (a mentor and an ex) pretty well."
4259,isfp,I've recently found that I cannot find any new music and wondered if any of you beautiful people have any music that never grows old for you... If would be greatly appreciated. Preferably anything but rap and country. Just whatever connects with you sounds great. I'm thoroughly interested in what you listen to.
4260,isfp,"Hope you don't mind these so long after you posted, and that you like them :)
Blind Melons (90's alt rock)
The Cure (Post Punk)
Type O Negative (Goth/Doom Metal)
Black Sabbath
My Dying Bride (Doom Metal)
The Pixies (Post Punk)
Bauhaus (Goth Rock/Post punk)  "
4261,isfp,"Jimi Hendrix, for albums ""Axis: Bold as Love"", ""Electric Ladyland"", and ""Are You Experienced""
...I would love to add more but he is truly the artist who has never gotten old for me. Pretty sure he is an ISFP also :)"
4262,isfp,"Sia. She's just recently had a breakthrough but I find her earliest work the best. 
Try listening to ""Breathe me"" for example. 
If you like that she's lent her voice out to a group called Zero 7, try out their earlier albums. Songs like In The Waiting Line, Destiny, Somersault. "
4263,isfp,"I‚Äôm curious to know if anyone here took the personality test and got 51% sensing and 49% intuition. I‚Äôm constantly fluttering between the two personalities and don‚Äôt know exactly where I fit or if I even want to fit into one or the other. 
Any advice for someone with an indistinct letter in their MBTI?"
4264,isfp,"Dude, yes! I used to be an INFP for yeaaars, everytime I did the test. About 4 months ago, I did the test again, and apparently I'm an ISFP now? So i assume I'm pretty 50/50 as well. I don't feel very ISFP though, not only because I used to identify as an INFP."
4265,isfp,I pretty much always get infp on the tests i just feel like i relate better to the isfp functions. Also my sister is so intensely infp that i seem wayyy more isfp in comparison. Yeah i think infp and isfp are harder to tell apart and theres more to the isfp personality that the tests dont do justice. I think a lot of people relate to both or waver in between.
4266,isfp,"Me! I was actually just browsing this sub to see if I could find relatable ISFP posts. I was INFP for years, and I have recently started getting ISFP. My N and F have always been very close percentage wise. I feel like I relate to more INFP articles and such, but after knowing both INFPs and ISFPs in person, I definitely seem more like an ISFP. I wish there were more articles and things for people who fall in the middle of these two types--apparently it is fairly common. "
4267,isfp,"I get infp on the tests but I am more like an isfp in reality. Imaginative, dreamy, yeah somewhat, but I have some kind of inherent concreteness, sensuality, simplicity, and acceptance that's isfp-ish at heart."
4268,isfp,"I don't seem to find a lot of intuitives in this area, even when it comes to awesome music few people listen to (symphonic metal). I have this unsettling feeling that a ""normal"" people make ""rare"" music for ""rare"" people, which translates to ""just someone trying to stick out"". But in reality ""normal and rare"" is a very sleazy dichotomy."
4269,isfp,"I‚Äôd probably have a tie for present and future, and past as last, as well. Idk, I think about the future A LOT more than seems stereotypical for ISFPS, however, it‚Äôs usually like within the next 5 or so years at most. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever just sat there and thought about what I‚Äôd be like at 80, or even 30 for that matter. I‚Äôll be 18 in a couple months, so I think about college a lot, and I kind of want to get married young-ish. Other than that, I‚Äôm mostly focused on what‚Äôs going on right now."
4270,isfp,"Present, future, past.  Sometimes I'll get really anxious about the future, usually after waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back to sleep, and sometimes I'll get really triggered about something in the past but for the most part, I'm right here, right now."
4271,isfp,"I think about the future quite a lot when I'm bored, I have plans for the future but I know things may change and these things may not happen however I mostly think about the present. I barely think about the past. "
4272,isfp,"Same! Like, I have some general plans, but I try not to plan stuff too much. It just seems like a waste of time considering you can‚Äôt control every single aspect of your life and have no idea where your life will be 10 years down the line."
4273,isfp,"I was wondering if any of you also had anxiety and how you feel it affects your personality? I feel like an ISFP but my anxiety makes me into a J many days when I'm really stressed out and I get really grumpy and nervous at the same time. It really goes against my go-with-the-flow, hakuna matata nature and it's frustrating. 
Anyone?
Edit: not specifically talking about social anxiety, although I agree that it's more common among introverted feelers. I'm asking about any kind of anxiety. For example, I have generalized anxiety so I get wrapped up in negative thoughts about myself and how other people perceive me. This makes me really critical, grumpy and angry some days even though I am usually a very laid back, loving person. "
4274,isfp,"I really connect with your edit and I think that's pretty much it. Introverted feeling types probably get anxiety really commonly, and I know I do. Even if I have a lot of good friends that I know care about me, I will always think people don't like me. People compliment me on a semi-frequent basis, but after all that I still think negative thoughts and I feel like no one likes me. "
4275,isfp,"I used to have a lot of anxiety, I had 2 forms of self-diagnosed OCD, fuelled by anxiety. 
But then I discovered meditation and mindfulness and have never been so relaxed in my life. It helped so much with OCD and anxiety because it allowed me to see how my mind actually functioned and to react appropriately to it. I highly recommend it if you're struggling with anxiety."
4276,isfp,"Created an account to comment on this! I generally relate to this for sure. It's something I've been learning to overcome. As of late I've just sort of been ignoring those thoughts and doing what I want to do, and a lot of confidence has come out of it. I also find that people are generally more attracted to you when you do what you do without worrying what people think. Even if it's not something you would usually think they would be into."
4277,isfp,"I don't know, sometimes I'll have anxiety and be nervous about seeking and then just try to get around whatever situation without saying anything. I'd say (haha) that it causes me to actually speak less to people or not even at all. I'm guessing you were referring to social anxiety"
4278,isfp,"I'm glad you understand how it feels. I connect a lot with your reply as well... That's exactly how I feel. It's funny because ISFPs are said to be one of the types that could care less what other people think but I'm terrified of being disapproved of. Possibly because I'm scared of making other people uncomfortable; like a twisted way of not wanting to force anyone to deal with my imperfections. It is very anxiety inducing for sure. 
I just hate that it gets so bad once in a while that I find myself criticizing and snapping at people that don't deserve it. "
4279,isfp,"Hey ISFPs
I know someone who tested as an ISFP today. Learning this really helped understand them.
However, a huge problem is that their self confidence is non-existent.
They are very sensitive to others and very critical of themselves.
So my question to you guys is how in the world can I help this person boost their self confidence?
Thanks"
4280,isfp,"Honestly? Agree with their negative assessments. Doing so helps us move on. You may have to agree with a lot at first. But we need affirmation (affirmation of the negative as well--but also affirmation of just who we are), not praise. We know our weaknesses better than anybody else. Recognize that yeah, we may not be perfect, and our stuff may be crap, but that doesn't mean that we can't move on, and do things anyway. Also, like others have said, it helps to do something. 

You should know that there's nothing you can say that will improve how we feel, or make us truly feel worse. If we take criticism hard, it's because we actually believe it already. So, one thing to do is to not criticize something we said or did that was worthy of it. You think we are ignorant of it, or blowing it off, but this is not true. Internally, we are probably seething, but we won't show it, so when you pile on, it reinforces what we already know, hence a negative reaction.
To me, the worst thing someone can say when I feel down is something stupid like, ""It's not so bad."" or, ""What you did is great! You just need to be more confident."" Bleh. It is so insincere to me simply because I can see what I did, and I know it's not what I envisioned. You may be happy with it, but if so.... well... it doesn't say much for you, now, does it? 
Don't offer empty platitudes nor lies, thinking we will believe them. Be harsh, be honest. Be true. That's what we need. Here's another thing. We may actually react negatively at first to that honest critique, but that is the fastest way to get us out of that. When you criticize, it is like a relief valve popping. 
Yeah, it's not pretty. But on the other hand, what that is of any value in this world has ever come easily, or without conflict or pain or suffering? Fe types, however, really suffer with this. Te types are more capable of handling this, as they operate in a similar way, only without depth (my opinion). 
Also, don't ask us to be responsible for your feelings and emotions. Don't blame us for making you feel bad. We don't blame you, and don't ask you to take responsibility for our feelings and emotions, so please, return the favor. BTW, I consider such people to be weak. Don't be weak. 
Lastly, don't take how we are as weakness. Treating us like a hurt puppy is the quickest way to earn our disrespect. We don't need, nor want your help to improve our self-confidence. What we want and need is for you to accept us as we are. When we know you accept us as we are, then we may open a whole, wonderful world to you. "
4281,isfp,"The problem is they are so unconfident about themselves that any type of positivity directed towards them is instantly shot down or turned around into an insult.  
This seems to be the most promising pathway yet. "
4282,isfp,"I agree 100%. What I need, above all else, is understanding and acceptance. Because most times, I don't know how to understand and accept myself. Compliments frustrate me as I don't need to be 'fixed' by your words. I simply just need someone to really listen and understand the problems that I'm going through. "
4283,isfp,They really like to do garden work. They have put a lot of work into sculpting their garden. Perhaps invite them over to create a garden and give them a lot of praise for what they did? 
4284,isfp,"I'm aware. 
I don't believe they are. They seem to have strong Se and a lack of Ne.
They are very attracted to hands on activities and shy away from anything philosophical or abstract that tend to attract Ne."
4285,isfp,"He's a pretty social person and I have no problem with him going out several times a week while I stay home. In fact, it's quite nice to have the house all to myself. He has a friend over about once a week. It makes me anxious, but I put up with it for him. But he will NOT stop trying to shove his friends down my throat.
Today I ran errands and he had a friend over. The friend and I were at the house together for about an hour. Not even ten minutes after his friend left, my husband said he was going to call his other friend (whom I don't care for....more on that later) to come over and watch Game of Thrones with us.
First, every Sunday night we grab a pizza watch Game of Thrones together. It's our thing. I would never invite someone over to watch GoT with us. That's like bringing a friend on a date.
Second, his other friend had JUST left. I can't do back to back social interaction in my home. I just can't.
Third, I don't like this friend. I think he's irresponsible and he's dragging my husband down. I have no desire to meet him or interact with him in any sort of way. My husband knows how I feel about him.
Of course this turned into a big fight about how he's not ""allowed"" to have friends. I will admit, I used to be a brat about his constant need for social interaction, but I've learned to deal with it. I don't care how much he goes out. I don't mind going to the library or a coffee shop for a few hours while he has someone over or even spending the evening in our bedroom with a book.
But none of those compromises are good enough for him. He wants me to be friends with his friends and interact with them the whole time they are here. He'll have people over for 12 hours sometimes. I can't do that. Just thinking about having to entertain someone for that long makes me want to cry. He doesn't understand that I get nothing out of interacting with his friends and most of the time I'm a third wheel. I don't like feeling like a third wheel in my own home.
I have zero interest in his friends. There are two that I like and can take in small doses, but the rest are not at all the type I want to be friends with. I feel that he sometimes has poor judgement in friends, but he is an adult and can make his own choices. I am SO done arguing with him about who he spends his time with.
I don't want to meet them. I don't want to go to their shitty house party. I don't want to hang out with them here. Quit trying to force your friends on me.
tl;dr: Husband keeps trying to force his friends on me."
4286,isfp,"ENFP here. Just started dating an ISFP and we just had that argument last night. He can't MEET any of my friends, which I find sort of bewildering and if I didn't like him so much, a dealbreaker. I'm trying to be understanding, I want you all to know. It's funny because I just wandered into this subreddit to see if anything would make sense, and this is the top post."
4287,isfp,"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. I couldn't do that either. I can't even entertain my friends for that long, nevermind someone I wasn't fond of.
I wish I had some better advice to give you. It sounds like you've already spoken to him about it, so if he's not understanding you then maybe you could involve a third party like a therapist? It may just be a breakdown in communication.
It's possible he feels like you're attacking/questioning his judgement in friends, especially if you mentioned that maybe it was something that you used to communicate poorly with him about?
I would maybe sit down and take a look at how you usually phrase things when you speak to him. I don't know what kind of language you're using, but when you talk to him about it, try to avoid saying things like ""you always do this"" or ""you do that"". Maybe try saying ""Hey, when this happens, it makes me feel like this.""
If you're already using this kind of language and he's still not willing to understand, then I'm not sure how you should proceed. See if you can get him to talk it out, maybe? What I mean by that is try asking him questions until you figure out what's really bothering him. Maybe just ask him in a very neutral and non-confrontational tone ""Hey, I was just curious why it upsets you so much that I'd prefer not to hang out with your friends?"" It may be there's something deeper going on here.
I'm sorry if none of that helped. If you just need to vent, feel free to PM me. I can listen, if nothing else. :)
Best of luck to you."
4288,isfp,"try explaining to him the kind of person you are.  introverted people need to be alone (or with someone they 100% trust, for you, your husband, and for me, my roommates) in order to 'recharge.'  Your husband sounds like an extrovert, obviously, and someone that recharges when around other people. 
As such, just let him know how you work, and that it kinda freaks you out when you're around people for too long.  Worst comes to worst, when they come over try holing up in your room if you start to get too anxious or upset.  Do something that helps you shut the world out-I play video games/listen to music/draw.  Also, as a way of compromising, ask him if he can hang out with his friends without you sometimes-let him go to his parties, etc. by himself sometimes so he doesn't feel like he's being shut away from his friends.  
Also in terms of the Game of Thrones thing, let him know that that situation in particular was a bit over the top as it is something you consider to be your 'couple thing.'  I know what that feels like, I'm pretty possessive of my friends at times.  I would suggest trying to test the waters with some of his friends, but that seems to be something that is out of the question, which also totally makes sense.  
In any case, just let him know that you have a 'home zone' of people that you are very comfortable with, and an 'outside zone' of people that make you uncomfortable if you are around them for too long.  Extroverts don't read that at all, as they start to shut down after they've been alone for too long.  Good luck, sorry about the wall of text, and I definitely think you can get this worked out, as long as you two can understand each other :) Feel free to PM me if you like, us introverts have to stick together :D"
4289,isfp,"I'm new to this sub, so bare with me.
At first I felt like you were kinda whining, but then I could pretty much relate with you. I hate dealing with people too much, too-my sister has a friend that comes all the time to the apartment unannounced, and even though I like her, it friggin annoys the HELL out of me when she comes unannounced, and even more when she stayed the whole weekend. Like, seriously, it's just too much-I need room to breathe, and also not feel rude by not entertaining the guest (and I'm pretty sure she could tell I was being stand-offish after the first day...)
It's a tough situation. He wants to be able to hang out with his friends and be able to invite them to his home when he wants to-who wouldn't want that? It's why I don't tell my sis to only let her friends come over certain days-because I don't wanna sound controlling. But the fact is, it's your home, too-You will have to deal with the friends that come in, and I know how exhausting it is to have someone over for a 12-hour period...maybe if you asked him to go to his friends houses more, rather than always inviting them to his house? I mean, if his friends always want to come over, surely they wouldn't mind having their friend over. 
But I do have to say, you do have to compromise yourself-sometimes, his friends are going to come over, and for long periods of times sometimes. It doesn't have to happen as often as it does right now, but it will sometimes. It sucks, and I know what you mean by that crying feeling. But it's something your husband enjoys-you can't just completely strip him from that. Plus, I agree, you shouldn't have to be friends with his friends...but yeah, you're gonna see them sometimes and, unless the friend is an absolute jerk or an unhealthy person to be around with, you have to deal with them sometimes for the sake of your husband. I'm not saying he's completely right-it's your house, too, and you deserve to be comfortable, and I do think he should probably invite his friends less often as he does now or try to go to other friends' houses more, but he's not completely wrong, too, and this is just something you will have to try to deal with sometimes. 
Hope I made sense. Part of this is rambling, because it is a bit of a tough situation-both partners are not fully wrong or right, just both need different things. It doesn't mean you guys can't find compromise though, and I'm sure you guys can do it. Good luck!"
4290,isfp,"I don't say anything negative about his friends unless he pushes me to tell him what I really think. I do think that he knows he has poor judgement in friends and me pointing it out makes him angry. Again, I don't say anything like that unless I'm directly asked. 
Our finances don't allow for counseling at the moment, but I definitely want to look into it when we can afford it."
4291,isfp,hmmm...people are so tough to communicate with 
4292,isfp,"Also, what differences do you notice between you and other ISFPs?
For me (I have Asperger's), while I do know ISFPs don't really value Fe, I know most ISFPs are still pretty good at actually using it. For me, it's quite stunted. I also don't really do typical Se activities, I generally just stay indoors and spend time behind my PC.
I'm also under the impression that my Fi is even stronger than that of the average ISFP, I can get offended very easily by the right words or actions, but most ISFPs seem to be pretty chill and have a ""live and let live"" attitude. Like, I mean I won't actually confront someone or call them out on something, but it definitely makes me resent people easily."
4293,isfp,"I have really bad anxiety and depression, so I have to take pills. I get offended easily, am scared of picking up the phone, and get extreme anxiety when I am in the presence of a high class person. I could stay home forever as long as I have Wi-Fi. Humans scare me. Dogs and cats are cute. I also have ADD. "
4294,isfp,"I just did the aspie quiz on the beautiful rdos website. apparently i'm a bit more neurodiverse than i was jan of last year!  
Your neurotypical (non-autistic) score: 76 of 200
You are very likely neurodiverse (Aspie)
the diagram thing"
4295,isfp,more-so since i think the other person wouldnt find it engaging. it‚Äôs also just difficult coming up with a response without sounding insincere or not into the topic at all but i‚Äôd like to hear your opinion
4296,isfp,Yes I agree. I really hate small talk and I‚Äôm also terrible at it. It‚Äôs so cringey when people talk about the obvious weather outside or the traffic lol. I always prefer to have more meaningful conversations and get to know others on a deeper level or not talk at all lol 
4297,isfp,"I'm an INFJ who is dating a female ISFP. I also know two other male ISFPs fairly well. I should have made this post ages ago because this has been on my mind for quite some time.
I constantly struggle to understand these ISFPs in my life, but mainly my girlfriend. She doesn't like to conform and is very silent. Her mannerisms are a little like mine and when I first met her I thought she was an intuitive just because of how silent she is and how much she appears to absorb everything with that confused but analytical look she often has. She is in fact an ISFP as I managed to get her interested in taking the test early on, not to mention the descriptions and cognitive functions line up and there's just no other type that she could be.
If I was to summarize my impression of the ISFP I would say the following: Reluctant to conform. Often very modest and self-sacrificing. Unsure of who they really are. Very adept at understanding what needs are being met or not met in a situation. A very strong set of senses. Sometimes prone to outbursts of inappropriate rage or an extreme sensitivity to their own emotions or the emotions of others. Sometimes prone to lying or holding back details (which can be considered lying) if they feel they can get away with something or if it's ""not a big deal"".
I apologize if this doesn't ring true for other ISFPs. This is simply what I have observed from the three that I know. Especially the tendency to tell small lies or react inappropriately. Of course, these people are likely unhealthy in numerous ways as the ISFPs that I know typically made poor decisions early on in life.
My girlfriend truly is an enigma to me. She is so just so silent and to herself, but then the next moment chatty so it's hard to really grasp who she is and how she processes things. She understands emotions greatly and seems to be quite intuitive at times, but it's like she rejects this intuition and the realizations that could follow. 
I've been trying my best to help her understand herself this past week as she claims that she has no interests and no sense of self. I refuse to believe this and so I hope to get some information from other people who share the same functions. The thing with her is that she followed the crowd for years, making very poor decisions while being manipulated and abused by egotistical ESTPs. This has no doubt left scars on her that she doesn't entirely acknowledge. I just get these moments where I desperately wish I could understand her more and it drives me crazy."
4298,isfp,"I'm unsure if ''not understanding'' is supposed to have a negative connotation or not, haha. Anyway.
ISFPs have Tertiary Ni. They can see the hidden implications behind situations, and those with stronger Ni will be able to see them clearly but unable to really respond to it in an appropriate way. (They mainly communicate through actions, not words.) Their thought process will sound somewhat like this: ''Oh, I bet they're feeling this way right now... I wonder what can I do to make them feel better.'', ''I see what you mean, but sorry, I don't know how to respond to it right now.'', ''So they're this kind of person.'', ''What is going on, and how am I supposed to react to this external stimuli?''
They need time to think by themselves. Lots of it. Expression of their deepest thoughts and inner self will be awkward, because they don't exactly know how to do it. And when we do express those, it will be such a big deal for us that we wouldn't know how to exactly handle it. Often it will take a long time to learn how to properly put it in words, and if the other person is even slightly dismissive then we will retreat even more into ourselves.
Not having a clear sense of self is more common in ISFPs (ironically?). We don't readily share our innermost selves as it's quite hard to grasp even for us. We connect to ourselves through solitude. When we are with people, we mostly try to gauge their feelings and moods and act to accommodate so that the other person will feel comfortable with us. If that makes sense."
4299,isfp,"That is me in a nutshell. I didnt go all anti-conformy on people but I've always wanted to be different. All my family are in the military and to me, there is no way in hell I'd ever be able to be told what to do or where to live. I'm an adult now, but I'm pretty independent. I don't like being bossed around or being in charge so the best jobs for me are those where I can do my job and not be hovered over by a boss. College was a struggle. I failed out twice until I moved across the country and went through a major that I'm passionate about and now I have straight As.
How old is she? How long have ya'll been dating? What questions do you have exactly?
About the chatty/ not chatty. Until I am very comfortable with someone, I can get in my head a lot. I don't like going out much (despite being a bartender) and in a group I usually just sit there and think to myself or stare at my phone. Groups are a little intimidating. With newer boyfriends I can get that way too. After a while with them, my full self comes out and I'm weird and often chatty though my SO and I just spend a lot of time doing things together (like video games) silently or just being around each other. 
Really, she will open up if given the chance and time. DO things with her... activities. That gets almost every ISFP I know to open up. As far as hobbies, she needs to take it upon herself to get out there and try stuff. Does she like animals? The outdoors? I find horses are very soothing to me. They give me a goal, something to work on all the time... things to talk about with others, friends are made through it easily, and its outdoors which is nice. I get to (and have to!) use my senses almost constantly and there is no human pressure... just you and a creature communicating through physical and mental connection. It lets me use my intuition in a way no other hobby really lets me do. My other hobby of video games lets me immerse myself in a world told by others. Sort of like a book, but visual. "
4300,isfp,"I'm very against lying which I feel can also be characteristic of ISFPs. We stick to our morals, whatever they may be. I avoid being the center of attention at all costs. I pretty much never end up raging at anything, I avoid conflict (for better or worse), and I prefer to deal with my emotions alone. 
I'm still trying to figure out many things about myself, so I wouldn't be surprised if she's in the same boat. Best of luck and hope this helps. "
4301,isfp,"Thank you for very much for your response. To clarify, I never meant it in a negative way! I am just genuinely lost when it comes to understanding ISFPs on a deeper level, but you've shed light on a lot of things. The thought process bit was very helpful. My girlfriend in particular does seem to go through it that way. It's interesting to learn that expression of their deepest thoughts is awkward. It makes sense. I've seen both of my ISFP male friends break down and really get into some deep stuff one night. They were experimenting with psychedelics. It was such a wild moment to see their true colors like that. For the most part they've always been rather reserved.
I understand now that my girlfriend needs more alone time. Whenever we are apart for long periods of time she appears to be more expressive afterwards. She hates alone time for the most part and will always find somebody to be around. I've tried to recommend being alone more but she doesn't seem interested. "
4302,isfp,"Oh. I'm not sure, but I think ISFPs who are less in touch with their Ni will need a lot less alone time, maybe. Some ISFPs might need a lot of solitude, some probably not. I, for one, am big on alone time."
4303,isfp,"I am afflicted with a sense that i am not the person i want to be. it‚Äôs as though there‚Äôs some way i feel very strongly i should be, but i recognize that i can never be that way. it‚Äôs like my feelings, thoughts and behaviors are not quite right, don‚Äôt line up with something deep inside of myself.
this is not a passing feeling. I‚Äôve felt like this for many years, starting from when i went through adolescence. and in fact, the exact reasons i‚Äôve had for not being satisfied myself have changed over time. there have been months when it‚Äôs been because i felt incapable of relating to other people, days when i‚Äôve been uneasy with my musical abilities, years when i‚Äôve wished i didn‚Äôt have any secrets i was ashamed of. I've always been sensitive--easily hurt and sensitive to other people's emotions--and when i was growing up, no one really knew how i was feeling most of the time. Instead, my intelligence was valued more highly than other qualities i have. maybe that's when the sensitivity got distorted into unease with myself.
it‚Äôs lonely, because no one else can feel how this feels, though who knows, maybe some people can relate. it feels incurable. people have certain qualities and auras about them that make them seem unique and give them a sense of having a soul. I‚Äôve always been very conscious of that, and one of my favorite things is to try to understand what makes people themselves, and how that shapes their experiences and relationships.
so i, like everyone else, have certain qualities and ways of being a part of the world, roles I fit into, an aura, a soul. As I get older, who I am has come into clearer focus. I‚Äôm not creating a person, but just understanding the one i happen to be.
i wish i had the strength to think for myself, to think about the world in  my favorite songwriters, like elliott smith and nick drake, are really fantastic at understanding the human condition, at painting human emotions in all their complexities. I want to make music that moves other people the same way I‚Äôve been moved. but instead, it seems like none of the insights, beauty, and catharsis i find in the songs i love are accessible inside myself. i can only seek them out in the words of others; i can‚Äôt come up with them myself, though i want nothing more than to be able to. that‚Äôs how it feels. like either the things i want to express are locked in my chest and i don‚Äôt know how to unlock them, or they‚Äôre not there at all. it doesn‚Äôt stop me from writing songs or trying to express myself, but it does stop it from being satisfying. 
i‚Äôve associated this sense of not being who i wish i were with the MBTI, for as long as i‚Äôve been exposed to it, which is something like 8 years now. it sounds insane, maybe, that this test, which is only a really rough outline of human personalities, could be a way for me to feel the pain of not being who i want to be, but it gives form to what would otherwise be a totally vague sense. like, i can say ‚ÄúI wish I were N instead of S‚Äù because it gives me a way to explain what i couldn‚Äôt explain otherwise, about who i wish i were but can‚Äôt become because in some ways, deep down, people are just the way they are and there‚Äôs no sense trying to change those fundamentals. fundamentals like how i get too caught up in the moment and don‚Äôt see the big picture a lot of the time, don‚Äôt see opportunities and possibilities and don‚Äôt have the kind of creativity that allows people to create worlds like the ones we lived in when we read our favorite childhood books. I used to wonder a lot about which type I was, as i tried to understand myself. now I definitely identify most with ISFP, but I wish I fit a different type‚Äôs description.
i wish there were a way to fundamentally change who I am. this feeling is the source of most of my sadness, and when i want to die, it‚Äôs only because i don‚Äôt see any other way of not being myself. of course there are solutions like figuring out what my goals in life are and following them, improving myself in the ways that I can, and being the best version of myself I can be, but though i've made a lot of progress in doing all of those, that progress hasn't made me feel much more at ease with who I am. and it's been years of trying (though definitely not as hard as i would if i didn't feel defeated by this whole problem in the first place).
I know this is hella long-winded and might sound defeatist, but i don‚Äôt know where else to discuss this, since it relates to the MBTI for me. I don‚Äôt know if anyone will read this fully, but if you do, thank you for taking the time. It wasn‚Äôt easy to write about this."
4304,isfp,"Hi! I'm in a bit of a rush so couldn't read all of this in great detail but I think I got the gist. Your personality is not set in stone. Life is all about growing and changing as a person. I personally was VERY introverted at one point as well as very, very shy. I always wanted to fit in but never could and sort of sat away from other people. When I was 21, I started working at a bar as a cocktail waitress. I've worked in the public before, but not where I constantly had to go up and develop relationships with people. My first table, I was shaking. Now, 6 years later, I'm a bartender and people argue with me that I'm not introverted and shy... that I'm outgoing and very extroverted. I'm still quite introverted, I get tired being in public, but I've developed myself quite a bit. Now I can go up to people or hold conversations. I have confidence.
Think about all the great things our type is good at. Yea, we aren't overly motivated when we don't want something. But when we do? Watch out! We are super in tune to our senses, can read the feelings of people quite well, usually appreciate the beauty of nature and music. You are comparing yourself to others in your music. But you can create music! My god, how I wish I could do the same. You have a beautiful uniqueness to you, whether you feel that way or not. Everyone feels self-doubt, but part of growing as a person is to accept who you are and grow yourself. Eventually you will find that niche in music or life that you want. You just have to keep growing and trying. Many musicians feel the same way you do, but their music is still loved and appreciated. 
We are a very special kind of person. You have types blindly flailing around, opening their mouths without thinking, running through life without truly experiencing or sensing the world around them. Is that really who you want to be? Or would you rather see all the things you do, feel those things, and grow your character and person throughout life to really be able to truly express yourself? Yea, we are sensitive to criticism... even someone telling me I have something in my teeth nearly ruins my day sometimes lol. But we can grow and channel that weakness into something powerful. 
Put yourself in uncomfortable situations, break out of your comfort zone that we all love so much. Grow yourself in all sort of different ways. But learn to love yourself for the very special talents you do have! You are a very special person and you SHOULD appreciate that. :)"
4305,isfp,"I notice pretty much every person I cross paths with. I'm constantly scanning the crowds for a familiar face. But when I see someone I know, I don't always acknowledge them. If they're someone I don't know well, or don't like, or sort of like ok but I'm not in a great mood, I pretend not to see them and keep walking. I'm not sure if people see me too but don't say anything, or if they just aren't as observant.
Also, this noticing other people thing can be overwhelming. I hate being around tons of people because it's so distracting. There are too many conversations that I want to pay attention to at once. And also, I kind of see people (mainly when I don't know/like them) as a threat a lot of the time, and that adds to it. 
Anyone else relate?"
4306,isfp,"This is so true for me too; everywhere I go  I can recognize most of the people I've met, but I just pretend not to see them unless it's one of my friends because I don't want obligatory greetings or small talks. "
4307,isfp,"Yes, I always see people I know or recognise from somewhere else when I'm walking around my university but 95% of the time I just pretend I didn't see them by pretending to use my phone. What do you mean by seeing them as a threat?I usually pretend not to see then because they are usually with other people while I'm mostly alone so I feel super awkward. "
4308,isfp,"You know how the Terminator is presented with a situation and a list of actions he can take? It's like that for me, only less badass and with the options cut down to ""engage"" and ""escape."" It's partly due to introversion, partly due to anxiety, and partly because I'm terrible at remembering names, but I overuse the ""escape"" option."
4309,isfp,"Sometimes my brain just gets sooo busy and won't shut up. It especially happens if I get super angsty or am sexually frustrated. Than, I feel like I'm reverting into teen form. haha. I think everyone must have their rage moments."
4310,isfp,"This is actually quite normal, humans in general are in constant conversations with ourselves. It seems to be the nature of our minds. 
If you are interested to see just how much you really are thinking I suggest you try mindfulness meditation sometime. It will make you aware of just how often you're talking to yourself. "
4311,isfp,"I read on the 16Personalities page that ISFPs tend to be less traditional and enjoy more modern, innovative music. I grew up with rock music from the 70s and 80s and I love it, but hate a lot of music from the 21st century. "
4312,isfp,"I don‚Äôt know about classical music. Electro-orchestral music, like World‚Äôs End Girlfriend sounds godly to me. Hmm. Listening to hard rock comes as no surprise. Metalheads usually listen a ton of different genres and artists. I mostly dig it for the bass and distortion. "
4313,isfp,"What ms interesting is that I also grew up with hymns and acappella. During my earlier childhood my dad played a lot of rock. Then we began attending a church for some years that only allowed acappella hymns to be sung/played. When we left that church, I was a young teen. My dad began playing rock music again and over time I grew to love it and develop a taste all my own. 
I wonder now if the ISFP in me drew me away from acappella hymns because it was the only music I could listen to up until we left that church setting and towards rock because it felt edgier and more rebellious. Dont get me wrong, I still enjoy acappella hymns and I'm in a choir as well, but for me, there's something about working hard and jamming to Led Zeppelin, Ozzie, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, The Rolling Stones, and Aerosmith. "
4314,isfp,"What's interesting though is that I'm really selective in my music tastes. I dislike rap, hip hop, country, EDM, pop, etc. Ill listen to rock, CCM, some classical, some acappella. I dunno, I'm just picky for some reason. "
4315,isfp,"That is interesting. Come to think of it, I‚Äôve always been surrounded by people who listened to a variety of it. You grew up with your dad‚Äôs rock and church, I grew up with my bro, who always played weird, experimental music around the house. He even had a Mongolian throat humming phase once when he was 15. So uh, that was interesting. Now he‚Äôs moved onto beatboxing.
Also I just read that you‚Äôre 22F. I‚Äôm 16F. Idk why I find this interesting too. Maybe you might?"
4316,isfp,"Haha that's interesting. I'll agree that listening to acappella can get tiring after awhile. I enjoy singing it though, so I guess it depends on which side of the music I'm on.
I tried teaching myself piano when I was about 17 but I didnt get very far since I never took any real lessons. I've always been good at singing, though. "
4317,isfp,"Age does somewhat have an effect on our musical tastes. I read somewhere that the music you listen to in your 20s kind of determines what you'll prefer for the rest of your life. I dont know if that's true or not seeing as I have hopefully another 50+ years to go yet. When I was your age I was listening to a lot of CCM, but just starting to get a feel for rock music and such. I was a lot more influenced by the music around me than I am now as well. Who knows what could happen in the future, but I'll probably still love rock. 
As for our age differences, I dunno. You'll change a lot in the next few years in many ways, because I know I did, and I still am. However, our underlying personalities tend to stay about the same, and as we grow older, we tend to become more set in our ways and more introverted (because we become more comfortable with ouselves). It's kind of cool. "
4318,isfp,"I don't mean poor people I mean people who have money and  think $2 is more important than their dignity. Some people have no money yet they know how to spend it on those wonderful moments. Other people have tons of money and they can't let a cent slip by unaccounted for. It's not about richness in bank account, it's about richness in spirit. 
Imagine your entire life being gridded up by monetary gain, every enjoyment is calculated and it's just.. it's no way to live. I could never be with someone like that, if they ever bought me flowers I'd just wonder what investment they think they're making (sex?) instead of just a gesture because they were thinking of me, etc. In every way it's just icky and takes away from the enjoyment of the moment. It's no way to live.
/vent"
4319,isfp,"No I totally agree. I got my nails done for fun cause I wanted to treat myself. It was my first time ever and people were like ‚Äúwhy would you spend your money on that?????‚Äù It‚Äôs like 1. My money is my business 2. Live a little 
But I dislike a lot of people sooo...yeah "
4320,isfp,"I'm an INFP and I've been good friends with an ISFP for about eight years now, but these days she hardly ever wants to socialize with me face-to-face. Yet she's always texting me and skyping me throughout the day. She can go for months without seeing me, then once in a blue moon, she'll call me up out of the blue and want to do something and then she'll go through a phase of seeing me a lot...but after a few weeks she'll start shutting me out again.
It bothers me because we live pretty close to each other and lately I've been really craving some kind of social connection, but she's been avoiding me, cancelling plans etc. Like I said, she texts me constantly but every time I say 'hey do you wanna go for a drink?' she gets all shady and tells me she's in ""hermit mode"" right now and she just wants to be by herself. But she's lying because there's this other group of friends that she often goes out to bars with and to music gigs etc. I see her mutual friends posting pictures of her online and it makes me wonder why she always says 'no' to me and 'yes' to them.
I tried to be straight with her. I said ""look I'm just feeling a bit lonely these days and I'd love to be able to hang out at the pub or just be in the company of you and few other friends"". She said something like ""yeah we'll have to hang out soon"" but it's always really vague.
Is this usual for an ISFP? Why does she call me her best friend and text me lots but never wants to hang out with me? Is she ashamed of me? Is there a better way to get ISFPs attention?"
4321,isfp,"Here's whats goes through a Fi egos head:
with that in mind its basically anyone's guess
feeling is way too super complex to give some kind of easy answer to
they're usually pretty honest though--if you just ask them they'll probably give you the end result of all this deliberation, so you don't need to try and do it for them"
4322,isfp,"I am like this, but this person seems a little extreme and it comes off to me like maybe they have some social anxiety. As an ISFP, initiating conversation doesn't come naturally to me (but am working on it), so I'd say that's normal. Like I'm the type of person who will go weeks without talking to a close friends until they message me first. It's how a lot of us are because we're so comfy being by ourselves."
4323,isfp,"I've noticed that, while I enjoy hanging out with friends, if I hang out a lot with one group of friends, I will be less willing to hang out with the other one.  It's like if all of your ""hang out with friends"" energy is being expended on one group, and you need to recharge in all the time you're not hanging out with them.  Any time you hang out with your ISFP friend, she may be having to negate time with her other group of friends to recharge.
Texting/chat isn't the same as social interaction and time commitment so it's pretty easy to do that a whole lot."
4324,isfp,"I have a close ISFP friend, and he's got like this uncanny ability to deduce exactly how things will go. 
He'll be like; ""Well the most likely outcome is X "" and he's right! I mean not always, but 90+ percent of the time he's right. He's very gifted at reading people, and knowing their actions often way ahead of time. 
I never thought of an ISFP as a detective. Fiction after all tends to have them all as INTX types.
Now that I've met one though, what sort of combination of functions is he using? Basically I'm asking ""how""? 
I am very curious.
Please, and thank you."
4325,isfp,"Yeah well we have the exact same functions as INTJs and ENTJs so it‚Äôs like that.
Even when I encounter huge problems in my life, they are things I almost always saw coming from a mile away and chose to ignore because I‚Äôm impulsive and like to live in the moment, brushing aside future consequences with kind of a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll cross that bridge when I get there‚Äù approach, or even trying to delude myself into thinking my intuition is wrong (it never is.)"
4326,isfp,ISFP‚Äôs are just really good at reading people‚Äôs intentions as ISFP‚Äôs are hyper aware of others feelings and thus great at putting ourselves in their shoes. Over time we can see the patterns and outcomes. But because of our ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù nature we don‚Äôt tend to judge and end up just saying it for what it is.
4327,isfp,"I'm pretty sure it's the Se/Ni function axis tbh. Se/Ni is reductive, seeing possible outcomes and narrowing down which is most likely to occur. ISTPs are good at it too, take Sherlock Holmes from the books (not to be confused with BBC's portrayed persona, possibly INTJ) for example. Se gathers data/info from the environment while Ni streamlines sequences of events."
4328,isfp,"For the purpose of answering the question I'll assume this ability to deduce future events is centered around people and their social/moral choices. A helpful way to understand how each type works is to break down their cognitive processes and focus on the functions they use. Possessing Gamma Quadra (Socionics reference. Gamma Quadra types: ENTJ, INTJ, ISFP, ESFP) functions(Ni,Fi,Se,Se) will make its users more adept at refining sensory information to make sense of hidden meanings. For an INTJ this process is centered more away from interpersonal relations and more towards deciphering large bodies of data to find the answers hiding in missable patterns (as I understand it). An ISFP is going to use these same functions to prioritize interpersonal relations, taking note of subtle variations in tone of voice, body language, and other forms of social interaction and unconsciously processing it with Ni to deduce hidden meanings. Fi takes these meanings and forms a method of judgement to protect itself and others and also to better understand itself and others. With enough use, this process can become faster and make an ISFP adept at making relatively accurate judgement calls on how certain individuals will behave within social settings and what fuels their motivations. Hope this was helpful."
4329,isfp,"Very good description of exactly how it feels. If you remember responding to my post a couple days ago it‚Äôs kinda the same situation. My intuition tells me that it‚Äôll just fade and move on, but I‚Äôm like pfft shut up you can‚Äôt possibly know that. Hey, at least if it does end up being right I‚Äôll maybe trust it more.
I think the reason we don‚Äôt trust it is because it always seems so silly to avoid something purely off the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù. It just seems like such a wasted opportunity. As if you can only truly know for sure when it happens. Ive had bad genuine bad feelings about things and still gone head first into them just to be sure. Although I think having the expectation in the back of our mind helps when it does come true."
4330,isfp,"This so much. And adding to the detective thing, when I was younger I was really considering studying criminal justice in university to become a private investigator lol"
4331,isfp,"Yeahhh, it‚Äôs a pretty bad habit haha. I like to think I‚Äôm good at planning ahead but when it comes down to it uh yeh, about that.
Interestingly, I wonder whether it‚Äôs also to do with just proving ourselves right? As if our intuition tells us something that will happen and instead of believing it we just go ‚Äúhm, let‚Äôs see if you‚Äôre right then, smartass‚Äù. Whatever the reason, we‚Äôre just never quite able to trust it."
4332,isfp,"Yeah it‚Äôs all fun and games when you‚Äôre under cover, doing surveillance, or pulling some James Bond stealth shit sticking a tracker or hidden camera somewhere.
But when you have to sit in court and testify against someone you manipulated into trusting you, or hustle every day to make a paycheck, or pack heat because people want to kill you for literally ruining their lives...that‚Äôs just no business for Fi, imo. ISTPs thrive in the business though. It seems like all the good PIs are ISTPs."
4333,isfp,"Decided to go through with one of my impulse plans and take a walk. Here I am sat in a new spot I discovered by a small stream. Playing some tame impala.
Which makes me think - whenever I‚Äôve just said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and done what‚Äôs on my mind, I‚Äôve never regretted it. Whatever you‚Äôre second guessing; do it! 
(Within reason of course. Don‚Äôt like, kill someone. Killings bad. Usually.)"
4334,isfp,"I followed my impulse plans a few months ago in regards to an trip to Paris literally the night before (had a layover thereand decided to keep the same first flight but reschedule the second leg to a few days later). Ended up immediately financially fucking myself over on rebooking fees and a taxi scam, losing my tennis shoes and having to walk the whole time in poorly-fitted very blister-causing Crocs, and nearly getting mugged and chased several blocks by a crazy guy shouting death threats. Was the highlight of my year 11/10 0 regrets"
4335,isfp,"We have this link stickied at the top of our ENTJ group - I've linked the ISFP version for discussion... It's very spot-on for my ISFP. 
http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/SEI-ISFp/
Do you ever catch yourselves when you're bottoming out? When work or home life is crashing? When your health is poor and getting worse? When a SO is about to leave you? 
The link mentions reluctance to think about the future - does that ever change?
Even in trying times, when I've had to snap my ISFP out of his coma - he'll slip back into it once all hell stops breaking loose. 
Does the world really need to be falling down around your shoulders to get your attention? Do you worry about your health, your job, your relationships? What would make you do something about it? 
As an ENTJ, I just have to let most things go or I'm seen as harsh, then I look up and my ISFP is completely gone! Why make me the bad guy? I don't want to be! 
SEIs are often highly disinclined to engage in productive tasks, and may be inclined to react to ""responsible"" individuals or environments as overly somber, cold, or dull. They often see the hustle and bustle of working concerns to be insignificant, preferring to focus on their own comfort and friendships.
So, how do you guys not get fired? Mine had his mother take him aside in his late 20's and give him a heads up that he was about to get the ax because (issues)...  He's well old enough not to get this lecture again, but it could happen. 
I don't want to be his mother figure. 
Any insights? 
If not, do you see this in yourselves? 
Thanks!"
4336,isfp,"As another user mentioned you posted socionics for isfj, but I did read esi (for isfp), lie (entj), and their relationship. The socionics entj sounds so carefree compared to mbti entj. I was actually reading dual relationship descriptions with esi and lie, and it sounds really appealing to me. I might seem carefree to my coworkers but I‚Äôm actually worried and serious almost all the time. Socionics says entj is romantic, creative, good at long term planning, not petty, democratic, and appreciative of isfp‚Äôs talents. As isfp, I relate to the description of isfp being pragmatic, loyal, and hardworking/disciplined. But I don‚Äôt think most entjs can handle the emotional outbursts isfps have sometimes. I really like the description of lie and esi though‚Äî it sounds appealing to need someone and to be needed, and lie sounds very attractive to me‚Äî but mbti entj seem more rigid, logical, and demanding especially entjs in the Reddit sub.
As for your isfp guy‚Äî he needs to want to learn how to be disciplined and value being realistic, because, you are right; who is going to pay the bills? He needs to grow up. Thankfully, my parents taught me that hard work is essential to success, and that success is important to surviving. He may need to learn that the hard way, through physical losses. He may need to experience it to truly want to learn it, since he has not absorbed it from a young age."

INTJ:
+I can get along with them rather easily, behavior-wise I'd say I'm way more INTJ than ISFP. Conversations with them are fun and interesting, I also tend to share interests and sense of humor with them.
-Can be a bit too uptight sometimes, immature ones are rather annoying (feelings are for the weak (basically denying their Fi), /r/iamverysmart behavior, etc) and their constant need to be working on something can be exhausting sometimes.
INFJ:
+They have this whole cool ""wise old person"" vibe going on, I enjoy that. Often very wise people. They're not really judgemental. 
-The INFJ doorslam. Are either really nice or really nasty. Can seem rather cold when they ""turn off"" their Fe and rely on their Ti.
INTP:
+Laid-back. Don't really judge you unless you do stupid shit. Will listen to most things you have to say. 
-Rather apathetic and hard to communicate with.
INFP:
+Very friendly and interesting people. Basically the more warm and dreamy INTJs. Very open minded.
-A little prone to fall into the ""woe is me"" mode and fall into a spiral of self-pity. Can be a bit pretentious (too open minded) from a PoLR Ne's perspective. Well, maybe I worded that a bit harsh..
ISTJ:
+Rather laid-back. They're rather relaxing to be around with.
-They tend to hold grudges REALLY badly so I tend to be rather careful around them. A bit too grumpy sometimes.
ISFJ:
+Generally very friendly. Keep their promises and don't forget things like so many other people do. Very helpful.
-Tend to be a bit too selfless sometimes for my tastes, infodump a TON during conversations, can do the ""either jesus or satan"" thing the INFJ does. A bit boring.
ISTP:
+Good sense of humor, laid-back, easy to talk to, pretty friendly (seriously their friendly side is underappreciated).
-A bit hard to have ""deep"" conversations with. Sometimes seem a little oblivious. 
ISFP:
Not sure what to say here because in my eyes it'd be basically reviewing myself. If I have to two things though, ISFP girls are the best and I find some ISFP's attempt at trying to be all artsy and hipster rather cringy.
ENTJ:
+Seem rather cool. Get shit done.
-A bit too focused on getting shit done, it seems like there isn't much more to them than that. Rather intimidating. 
ENFJ:
+Very friendly and understanding. 
-Too selfless and focused on other people for my tastes, can get really annoying (basically most /r/2meirl4meirl posts). 
ENTP: 
+Sometimes funny. Will listen to most things you have to say.
-Tend to be very snarky, sarcastic and intimidating, often attack Fi views in the most aggressive way possible. Nobody can tear someone down harder than an ENTP. 
ENFP:
+Very optimistic, friendly, energetic and fun. 
-Can be a bit tiring to be around after a while. 
ESTJ:
+Goofy sense of humor. 
-A bit too focused on getting shit done, it seems like there isn't much more to them than that. Rather intimidating. 
ESFJ:
+Generally friendly. 
-Very unaccepting of things they deem weird, generally a bit fake, gossip too much and don't really respect alone time. 
ESTP:
+Somewhat cool. Their ability to adapt to any situation is pretty impressive. 
-Can be very intimidating if angry at you or unhealthy. Unhealthy ones are probably the worst people to encounter irl. The douchebro bully stereotype is 100% true for those.
ESFP:
+ESFP girls are hot. Very fun and easy going. Know their friends very well from experiences and go much deeper than people give them credit for. They bring out the best in me.
-Sometimes a bit too energetic, I'm rather lazy so I don't really want to do that much stuff. A bit too focused on the real world, don't really enjoy things like games and anime most of the time. Unhealthy ones can seem a bit like unhealthy ESTPs."

4341,isfp,"lol i guess not. i think istps might want to show off a specific skill or interest of theirs, but that sounds more like a character flaw of your brother than a problem with istps. not trying to sound defensive, i just don't see that as one of our negatives. if i picked one it'd be more along the lines of being standoffish and unintentionally rude, not knowing how to start conversations (or always put our thoughts into words), lazy, detached, emotionally dead, etc. "
4342,isfp,"When summer ends, i'll start my last high school course, then i'll go to the university. I would like to work on something that lets me help other people, my options to physiotherapy or engineering (CS). I will probably end studying engineering because it has more employment opportunities but i think i'll love to study physiotherapy because i really like how the human body works. So I have a full year to choose and that's not enough time for me to decide. Sorry for unnecessary text, i felt bored."
4343,isfp,I am a physio. I enjoy it. I find doing what I enjoy is better than doing what will be the better career choice. What is the point doing something you dont likr. But use the time to maybe shadow both professions. Might help you decide. 
4344,isfp,"Maybe it's an ISFP thing but I find myself giving the same advice to undecided friends: do what you enjoy/ are passionate about and I don't think you'll ever go wrong.
I'm going into elementary education and also interested in cultural studies, animals, and travel. "
4345,isfp,"As I've entered my 30's I have noticed a real shift in my life to a quieter place. In my 20's I was a true idealist and often scored as an Enfj. I had a variety of jobs, string of romantic relationships and traveled around the world. 
These days I've consistently scored as an isfp and I'm really comfortable with it. I'm finally married, live in a quiet rural place and have begun to dabble in painting. Perhaps I was an isfp all along but just had the energy to always be out and about, experiencing all that life has to offer  me. 
Have you shifted from one type to another in life? When did you notice? "
4346,isfp,"I took the test first when I was 16, then 18. I'm now 21 as an isfp, and I began an enfp. I understand the shift to a quieter place, I also learned to shelve my emotions a little better when I needed to. I like who I am now at least.  "
4347,isfp,"The tests gave me all kinds of results. But looking back on how I was and how I am now, I think I've consistently been an isfp. I know as a kid I was an Fi dom, always wondering why people have to act so shitty, and always being kind to others because I know how it feels. I don't think that's ever changed.
The first time I took the test I got ISTJ and was all ""Yeah! I AM a macho man!"" My bf was like no you're not... Then I took it again got ISTP and I was like ""yeah! I'm the most badass type!!"" The tests suck lol"
4348,isfp,"Not always. When I was younger, I think I was an E_FP and in the past few years, I've been fluctuating between ISFP and INFP whenever I take a bunch of tests. 
There was definitely a change between high school and the latter half of college. I'm not sure exactly what happened, but I became a lot more reserved and sensitive in recent years."
4349,isfp,"I've only taken the test throughout the past couple years, and it's been pretty consistently ISFP. Looking back on my childhood, I was definitely an ISFP all while growing up (possibly ISTP). In mid high school, I probably leaned towards an ESFP at points, but became way more withdrawn in my senior year. I've tested INFP a couple times, some tests say I could be an even balance of N/S, but based on my experiences, I definitely have WAY more Se than Ne. "
4350,isfp,"ENFJs when they are young, are masters at leading people, and getting them to work together to get things done. They are also master manipulators. ISFPs, on the other hand, can be outgoing, but they tend to be more loners, but will play with or take along anyone who will go along, but they won't ""lead."" ENFJs also tend to manifest themselves quite young--as young as 3 or 4. Our ENFJ daughter was one of those. At 3, she could get her older brother and sister to do whatever she wanted, and in preschool, she was the shaper of the class's mood and behavior. I can't imagine an ISFP being like this. So, the first question to ask yourself is, which were you as a young child? 
If you were the ISFP, then understanding that as we grow, we manifest ourselves different ways. ISFPs, especially in their teens and 20s need to be on the move. We need to experience, and experiment, often in our minds. I say it's because of our weak intuition coming ""on line"". It, together with our inferior Te, can lead us to new things--including academics or theory or idealism. But our Se is still where we want most to be. What you describe can just as easily be an ISFP thing--and more so than ENFJ, IMO. People are not static. We change and we grow and we mature. And that's a good thing. Wait until you're in your forties or fifties, and you suddenly want to do those things you did in your twenties. That's the weirdest one, IMO. ;-)"
4351,isfp,"Great point! I have actually been doing a lot of reflecting on my youth and agree with what you are saying. Perhaps I wasn't  an ENFJ at all and instead the ISFP that I am so sure of now. I have never wanted to lead others but am more than happy to be with others in a harmonious exchange. I really wish I had given myself an artistic outlet growing up that I could have turned to instead of just working part time job after part time job. Oh well, now is the time to make up for the past. I am learning to paint and the piano in my mid 30's. I can't wait to see what middle age holds for me! "
4352,isfp,"Welcome! I also agree that personality cafe is a good site in which you can talk to many people about whats common between yourself and others. Typefinder is great too and it's very informative! I've used both many times. Also if you want to delve even deeper to learn more about yourself and how to improve then I would say visit http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/dis_sample_36.asp#.UyH-noUVA_c you can read amazing things about personality there, enjoy! :)"
4353,isfp,"My personal favorite is Typefinder. We used it for school because it's really lengthy and informative, but makes you feel really good about yourself while reading. It has a lot of good information like how ISFP's are like in the workplace, as parents, and in relationships and stuff.
Here's the link if you want."
4354,isfp,"I'm a rising senior in high school and I was wondering what sort of factors (size, major, vibe of the place, etc) made you choose the college you did. Are you happy with the college you went to or do you regret it? I'm just a formless blob not knowing what the hell I'm doing and could use a little guidance. "
4355,isfp,"Lmao didn't go. I totally respect the dedication it takes to go to college but, for me personally I'm not going thousands upon thousands of dollars into debt and throwing away 4 years of my life just so I can find out what I don't want to do with the rest of it, y'know? Not saying this is everyone's experience, but I can tell it would be mine. I love learning and I love knowledge but I'm in the ""knowledge should be free or understandably priced"" camp and right now it (university I mean) just isn't."
4356,isfp,"I'm two grades above you, I went to a small liberal arts college called St Olaf for a semester before dropping out. I hated it. Really really make sure that when you pick a school, you take a good a look at the culture of the school. Make sure you like the extracurriculars and the town it's in, cause the vast majority of your time is not gonna be spent in class or studying.  "
4357,isfp,"Absolutely loved my college. I think the most important factor was visiting just to be on campus and get a feel for what it's like there. I was thinking in terms of ""this is where I'm going to live for the next 4 years, I should make sure it feels like home and I'll fit in here."" 
I also didn't have any idea what major I wanted to pursue, so that wasn't a factor for me. If you have something specific in mind that you want to study, that's obviously very important. I chose a school with a wide range of options so I'd be sure they had something I was interested in whenever I did decide.
EDIT: You mentioned in another comment that you're shy (as a lot of us ISFPs probably are). Maybe ask about the schools' orientation programs. Mine was amazing and created an environment where I was super comfortable meeting people. My dorm was really tight-knit as a result and I'm still best friends with some of those people. I think that made a huge difference where I otherwise would've struggled to make friends."
4358,isfp,"I chose my college based on a couple factors. It needed to be well within my range of standards because it costs a lot of time and investment of money once you make the commitment. I had already decided I wanted to go to a top public university within my state anyway, so applying my selection of choices was easy enough. I got rejected by the most prestigious ones, accepted by the ones next in line, and waitlisted by others. At that point I just had to pick out of the ones that accepted me (since waitlisting couldn't guarantee me a spot), and from then on it was a matter of visiting the campuses, seeing what they're like, and then determining which one I felt most comfortable going to.  
A point to make: if you have any specific major or career in mind, make sure they have good programs or departments at the university. I was undecided so it wasn't a particularly big issue for me, but since I had chosen to go to a prestigious research university I ended up closing off possible routes you might have found in other types of higher education (community college, trade school, etc.). Animation was one of the things I was interested in pursuing, but I crossed that possibility off once I decided upon the university I ended up attending.  
As for what my university's like, it's quite big (30,000 students) but it wasn't a big deal for me since I was used to attending a large middle school and high school of an average of 3,000 (I had grown up in a major city). Meeting fresh new people every day made things fun and interesting. The college town is very safe, and I enjoy being able to walk around at night without feeling afraid (again, grew up in a major city so I normally wouldn't do that at all). However, it can be a little boring because it's so safe, so it's up to the students' preferences on what they want the vibe to be like. I personally didn't mind since I usually spend my free time indoors anyway instead of going out lol.  
Lastly: I don't particularly regret going to the school, but I don't particularly find myself attached to it either. It depends on your own view of the college experience: are you treating it more like a business to get it over with and get your degree? Or are you there for the life itself and looking to make lots of good memories? I was initially the latter, but ultimately ended up as the former.  
College is a life changing experience no matter what, so you take away from it what you can. I had good financial aid (with the mistake of deciding to dorm because I personally did not have a good experience with it and am now stuck with loans thanks to that...), so to me overall it was a positive experience. I now made myself more marketable in the job field because I attended a well known college, and I have plenty of relatable/college stories to tell all the new people I meet.  
Sorry for the long post but there's my 2 cents! Hope that helps you out :)"
4359,isfp,I went to the university my dad went to. I wasn't leaning to a particular university (was lost and had no idea what I wanted to do..). The only thing I would change looking back is I would have gone to a university different from my hometown. My uni was full of snobs.
4360,isfp,"My friends and family pressured me to at least take some online classes. I had no idea what I wanted to do at the time and was working full time in a fast food kitchen. I was interested in computers at the time so I went into IT. I think I did 1 lesson realized that this is retarded and just like the bs busy work I had to do in high school and never logged back in. 
So for an entire semester I convinced my parents I was still taking the class. I got some emails from the school asking if I was still attending and just ignored them. I figured I was out a grand and just wouldn't go back next semester. Then one day I got a check in the mail returning the majority of my money. Well my parents were kinda pissed about me lying but they understood not wanting to waste money on something I wasn't 100% sure about. 
So I continued working fast food, became the best grill guy at the busiest of 4 other restaurants in our chain in my city. Then I quit and became a 2nd shift lead at a small local manufacturing plant in less then 4 months. I get to be in charge of run a cnc router. Basically it's like being a computer tech+mechanic. Its fun and has lots of hands on stuff plus troubleshooting. I love it so far. It's kinda weird though because it's just me and 2 other guys at night, and Im new enough still that I generally have zero idea what I'm doing. It's all trial and error. I love it.
TLDR I dropped out cause I didn't have any idea what I wanted to do. Found a job I enjoyed. Better than college."
4361,isfp,"I'm on mobile and don't know how to quote so I'll copy and paste it here.
""are you treating it more like a business to get it over with and get your degree? Or are you there for the life itself and looking to make lots of good memories? I was initially the latter, but ultimately ended up as the former.""
Interesting. I intend to make it the latter but I never thought about it becoming the former. I want to make it to decent college but honestly there's a little devil on my shoulder that is whispering in my ear that I'll never get accepted anywhere and that scares the shit out of me. "
4362,isfp,"So I live in a pretty liberal Jewish community right outside of Boston. I can take a 15min T ride and be downtown, and I don't have any friends who live more than a 20min walk away. So there's always a ton to do. Restaurants, parks, movie theaters, baseball games etc. I don't even have a driver's license cause I simply don't need it.
Now Northfield, Minnesota on the other hand, is a very small, rural, conservative Lutheran town. There's one street with a few restaurants and clothing stores that was like a 20-30 min walk from campus, and a Target and some fast food chains you have to drive to get to. It felt like living in the middle of nowhere. There was just nothing to do. Plus I felt like I had nothing in common with the vast majority of the people there. There were 11 other Jews out of the 3,300 students, and I met people who had never seen a Jew before. There were parties after Trump got elected, which is absolutely unheard of where I'm from. People were just different. And it was really hard. The few friends I made there were from cities outside of the Midwest; they were the only ones I felt like were even remotely similar to me. There was also zero diversity, minus a few international students who pretty much kept to themselves. It was just crazy different from what I was used to.
I really liked my classes, but I couldn't handle feeling like such an outsider. When I applied I didn't pay nearly enough attention to the culture of the school, I had only really looked at the academics. That was a big mistake."
4363,isfp,"Mine was mid-sized (around 20,000), but I don't know what will feel right for you. I don't think big necessarily equates to being harder to meet people. At a bigger school you might not see the same people around campus all the time, but there will probably be more student groups and activities to join. "
4364,isfp,"Honestly? I'd say that's a pretty normal feeling. Nobody knows how their college application results will turn out until it actually happens. Some people will take it harder than others, but I personally didn't have a ""dream school"" or anything like that so I knew I had to get somewhere decent and to me that was enough.  
Just aim for a wide selection of colleges to apply to - ones that are extremely competitive (who knows? You could get accepted on the 1% chance according to my mom) and ones that you know you could qualify for but are still good (they may still have their own worth from strong departments, renowned professors, national sports teams, etc.). I applied to around 7-8 colleges using that range and got accepted into several, so as long as you have that ""backup"" college that's easy to fall back on, you'll be fine. Don't listen to that devil on your shoulder, you WILL get accepted somewhere :) Just make sure to do your research!  
Also, you don't have to take what I said about the former and latter thing too seriously - everyone is a mix of both regardless. People obviously go to college to get that degree, but at the same time they don't want to hate their lives in the process. I personally had gone through a whole lot of ups and downs throughout my time there (hence, the ""life changing experience no matter what"") and after 5 years, I was really tired and ready to graduate. Call it senioritis, if you will. I know a lot of people on the other hand who weren't ready to leave and had anxiety transitioning into the real world. I don't doubt that when that time comes for you, you'll look back upon your current worries and think they weren't so bad after all. After all, look how far you've come to begin with!"
4365,isfp,"Ah I see now. I feel you, my parents keep wanting me to check out this prestigious state college but it's just not for me. Everyone is rich and preppy. I've heard some racist scandals there too. I wouldn't fit in at all. "
4366,isfp,"Whenever I read ISFP descriptions, they almost always mention that we're all very prone to be passive-aggressive or react badly to any criticism. Then there's also the thing about being impulsive and stuff, and while I've definitely had my share of being impulsive, there's always some thought to justify that action. I don't know. I think I do have all of those traits, but they were never given a chance to manifest because I had a lot of adult figures that helped me manage those traits.
¬†
When I looked beyond those MBTI websites and more at actual ISFPs who describe their own experiences in life and stuff, I always manage to feel such a deep sense of connection that I find it's almost impossible that I could be typed otherwise. Some types came close to I can be like, but I never intrinsically felt that those descriptions were what I was actually like. 
¬†
There's still definitely issues in how I how I fit as an ISFP though, like how we're described as 'kind' and 'gentle' and 'sensitive'. That doesn't sit well with me. I think what those websites forget to mention is that ISFPs won't cater to all the needs of everyone to make sure they're all happy and shit. I'll definitely take the time to be polite and make sure you aren't breaking down into crying fits, but other than that, I can't say I'll be bothered if people are having a bit of a bad time?  Like if they're feeling bad about getting a terrible score on their test or they had a spat with their friends.
¬†
I'd rather let them sort through their own stuff first, unless it's imperative that they need some support. I normally don't go out of my way to be a great or kind person. 
¬†
I'm also unsure about what my value system is. I have some vague notions that I am able to describe to you if you asked, but other than that, I'm not sure what these values specifically are. What anything really is to me, honestly. I must have some value system, because there are definitely moralistic boundaries that I can't cross and will never allow myself to. 
¬†
Maybe the reason I don't know much about what my value system is because I don't get enough situations in life to test it because I'm pretty young. And also the fact that people are mostly respectful and accommodating, so I never get a chance to define what values I have and don't have. I also don't know what a 'hands-on approach' really means to me for probably the same reasons I just stated.
¬†
I've always been well-organised which I've heard is unusual? I will occasionally leave stuff untidy, but only because those things didn't matter to me. It happens to be that almost everything matters to me. 
¬†
I also have a healthy ego. I don't trust myself to underplay or overplay whatever abilities that I have. I always keep in mind that I have a share of good and bad traits, and I'm okay with that. When someone compliments my art, I get a little spark of joy. I will raise an eyebrow if someone compliments an artwork I don't find that well-drawn or put much effort in, but I don't downplay it or deflect the compliment. Maybe I will if there's a whole bunch of compliments, because then it's overly much and I get sheepish. 
¬†
Criticism I can take well, because I've learnt that in most cases it will actually help. Sometimes when some harsh comment is said about me without any explanation whatsoever, I can't help but feel a prick of hurt and anger. That will quickly die out when I assess the person the comment was from and what I may have done to have warranted it.
¬†
Other than that, I'd say that most descriptions fit pretty well with me and I've just discovered that ISFPs can WILDLY differ from each other which I think is cool and reassuring. "
4367,isfp,"That's the funny thing about the value system for an ISFP. We're not always fully aware of it, but we always know once the line has been crossed.
I'm carefree and laid back and friendly, but I am sonetimes prone to being insensitive to others without realizing it. That's something that I've been working on and I have become more sensitive in the past few years. Did this turn me into the stereotype you find in descriptions? Hell no. 
There are a lot of misconceptions about the mbti system and somehow weakness always gets dumped on the feeling types."
4368,isfp,"Not everyone fits the description of their type to a T. As much as the MBTI works towards encompassing personalities, it's not infallible. An INTJ can be warm and compassionate, while an ENFP could be calculating and even cruel.
I am an ISFP as well, and while I don't really care for conflict there is few things that bother me more than passive-aggressive tension. Whenever an issue arises in a social situation, I prefer to work towards an upfront and even diplomatic solution. In the long run there's going to be more trouble running from problems or covering them up, so the best solution in my eyes is to work towards compromise.
Don't let it get you down because you don't fit the archetype completely. If anything it makes you a little more interesting and varied as a person."
4369,isfp,"Seems like every year or so I repeat the cycle of hating my current career and wanting to end it. By the time I‚Äôm able to quit I‚Äôd be at 11 years towards my retirement. 
I have to admit I‚Äôm almost never happy with what I do but I stay because:
1) it‚Äôs a career that forces me to be stable 
2) it‚Äôs a comfortable life when it comes to pay 
I just feel really miserable. I‚Äôm at a point where I thought I loved it and I wanted to deploy etc but now that all of that is upon me, I‚Äôm thinking about the time I‚Äôll miss with my son and the constant stress and anxiety.
What would y‚Äôall choose? Stability or a perceived chance at happiness? "
4370,isfp,"I just left my second grade. I came to realize that I want a stable life without worrying about my fucking job. I was trying to put my passion into a job, but that vanished my passion. I don't like to create a product, I like to create art.
So this september I'm gonna start a new grade in Administration so I can work from 7 to 3 and do my passion in lovely afternoons. 
I'm with you, buddy. We all live in the same planet afterall ü§ó"
4371,isfp,"Right there with you and my resume shows it.  I have about 1-2 years experience at each job.  It‚Äôs pretty wild,  but I finally found a great job and great company.  I‚Äôm approaching 2 years and don‚Äôt have the COMPLETE urge to quit... move to the mountains... work at a small grocery store... read a lot of books and go hiking... UGH.  It sounds so appealing but I know I need to stick with a good thing and set myself up for a graceful retirement.
The big thing for me is to continue pursuing my passions/projects.  This job gives me peace knowing I can still do that and not feel like I gave up.  Plus, it‚Äôs a fantastic work life balance.  I‚Äôm pretty much my own boss and spend a lot of time alone with little splashes of human interaction throughout the day."
4372,isfp,"Suggestion:
Get a stable job that is stable, but has fixed working hours!
I personally work a day job from 8am to 5pm, Monday to Friday, and when I'm home, I practice my art (I write).
This way, I get to practice my art without it being tainted by the pressures of money
~ISFP"
4373,isfp,"The only things I require from my job are:
1: They let me work at my own pace. I'll get the work done. I only cut corners on things that don't matter to me. My well being that comes with my paycheck matters to me.
2: They ask me instead of tell me to do extra work. I will fucking quit on the spot. Im irrational when Im mad. I ain't about to be someones bitch.
and 3: I get paid on the same schedule without fail. If its gonna get delayed thats fine. Just let me know.
Choose happiness dude. Its a harder life, but its a happier life."
4374,isfp,"Lmao I swear I have that same urge ALL the time. I think I could be happy off the grid without the pressures of society, but I do have a child to take care of. Hopefully your current job stays healthy for you! "
4375,isfp,"Kill. I did the buddy program in the Marines. Ended up in the fucking infantry though. I was young and stupid and signed an open contract. Let a recruiter sweet talk me. Military service is fucking torture. I couldn't fucking stand being micromanaged.  The retirement plan is so fucking good, but I don't think its worth it personally. You're basically giving your entire life to an organization that only sees you as a pair of boots."
4376,isfp,"i read about almost all loops.but i have never dug into the fi-ni loop that you isfps have.anyways,as isfps,what does an fi-ni loop look like?what happens inside your head when you in this loop.explain in detail,also im taking it,it has to be very abstract since ni and fi are the most abstract functions.do you ever get to points were you cant verbalize your ideas at all because of this,anyways just describe there whole thing to me pls,thanks,:)"
4377,isfp,"Fi is that unique feeling things have all the time that you can‚Äôt really explain with words, and then sometimes you go to ‚ÄúI want what I want when I want it,‚Äù which is Se, and then really sometimes you go to Ni, which is thinking in pictures, metaphors, randomly knowing how someone will react or what someone is going to say, and when you do things like, ‚ÄúI was seeing it, but I wasn‚Äôt seeing it.‚Äù Fi-Ni is only Fi and then only Ni and then only Fi and then only Ni. Basically don‚Äôt be anal about being anxious for those of you with stronger metacognition. If you don‚Äôt get what I mean don‚Äôt worry about it. 
I‚Äôm an ENFP though."
4378,isfp,"Hey guys! This is my first post on r/isfp and I just have to say it's really cool hearing from so many people like me! Mbti is such an amazing tool and just really interesting in general. 
So I was wondering- do you guys cry in books and movies? I rarely do, in fact I can only remember 3 times that I have openly cried in a book or movie. Usually I find that I am not very affected. I view myself as an emotional person, but a lot of times I find that many people have stronger emotional reactions than me. 
Does anyone else relate to this? I am assuming it's because isfps have dominant Fi which isn't really influenced by others.  Do you think that since isfps are extremely familiar with their own feelings it takes really strong emotions to get them to cry or show an outward response? "
4379,isfp,"I do cry in movies but only with seemingly random things. If something is very touching and Ive bonded with the characters, then tears. Futurama can consistently make me cry, I don't know why. Something about it really touches me.
In my relationships I've only been brought to tears twice once during a break-up and now we're back together because she is literally perfecy. But when I argue with her I prefer to leave my emotions to myself and become fairly cold. I think it's a little off putting, but I think staying rational is most important with serious matters. Emotions are better left to appreciate things which are particularly beautiful not for when things get ugly. So if I'm angry I don't show it. If I'm sad I usually bottle it up. If I love something so much I can't contain it THEN I cry."
4380,isfp,"Hi! Thank you for posting!
I hardly ever cry during books and movies. I have come close a few times, where my eyes have gotten teary, but I've never straight out bawled or anything. It might affect me a lot on the inside, but I rarely show much of an outward response, so yes, I think that is due to F being introverted.
I'm not really that comfortable with emotional expression around others. It feels awkward and kind of fake for me to do so, to be honest. I can come across as kind of cold or detached because of that, and I agree that others often seem much more emotional."
4381,isfp,"i don't cry about books or movies either and i think it's because i can recognize too well that the stories in them are fictional and never actually happened.  i think it's an Se thing
lmao probably"
4382,isfp,"This! I also cry at random, small moments. Things where a parent comes to hug and keep the child safe in their arms especially gets to me. It's more uncontrollable tearing up than actual crying though."
4383,isfp,"Miley Cyrus has always seemed like an ESFP. She is a natural-born ""entertainer"" and basically lives to put on a show (remember the Bangerz era? Her dom Se was all over the place). She doesn't seem to use intuition much, very much lives in the moment and is guided by her senses and such.
I think I remember in several interviews, people have regarded Britney as very introverted and quiet since childhood (she herself admits this). ISFP's tend to have a completely different extroverted persona on stage or whenever they're performing their particular craft (aux Se), and then offstage they're more reclusive and shy with their socializing (dom Fi). Her breakdown in 2007 is definitely reflective of some sort of crisis with her Fi/Fe, as well as paparazzi constantly bombarding her when she probably just wanted to be left alone."
4384,isfp,"yes, but I think for me it's just that my vocabulary isn't very good. I'm really into languages and linguistics but still don't really care too much about learning new vocabulary. I have trouble expressing what I really mean most of the time, or i forget what to say in a conversation or something"
4385,isfp,"Is this common for other ISFPS? and if so how often do you receive compliments.
‚Äã
I enjoy these compliments. but sometimes i get all messed up because i would question myself if they are actually being serous. 
Most of the time they are genuine.
but i  understand that compliments could also be my weak-spot.  "
4386,isfp,"I feel like you need to address why you hate spending time with this person. If you're not comfortable telling him you don't want to go and you don't enjoy spending time with him, is this really a friendship?"
4387,isfp,"If I were you I wouldn't go... after years of hanging out with friends that I don't even like, I learned those friendships never last anyways. If you hate spending time with him then that's your body telling you something..
If you feel like you have to go, how about inviting another friend you like too? Having another friend with you will make it more endurable"
4388,isfp,"True. Still, finding the practicality in being in good terms with someone, whether it be learning something from them, or something more.. greedy... well, we both benefit, i just don't enjoy his presence at all. Thanks for commenting at all, really. I went into this expecting to get.. people being unhappy about my post, more or less."
4389,isfp,"This post probably isn‚Äôt what you think it is, I think the indigo/crystal child belief is egotistical and too out there. It kinda seems like they‚Äôre describing a personality that has been around forever and saying they‚Äôre a new wave of human being. 
Anyways, someone told me I seemed like a crystal child (I do like me some crystals) and reading the traits, I feel like it‚Äôs literally just an ISFP they‚Äôre describing. 
Here‚Äôs some excerpts from a list on psychicelements.com: 
They have a penetrative gaze, sensitive both mentally and physically, spontaneous and act before thinking, natural huggers, feel connected to all humankind, healers and psychics and these qualities vary from barely discernible to full-on, love music and signing but hate loud noises, loving and easy going although they will process through the normal stages of tantrums, badly affected by negative events, aren‚Äôt comfortable by noisy environment 
So yeah, who agrees that all of these traits describe the ISFP or who believes in indigo/crystals?"
4390,isfp,"Hmmm. I can see why people connect with this, hell I would love to be one. But really I think it‚Äôs just an ISFP or maybe a version of. And with crystals I love them but I don‚Äôt think they have any energy or anything like that. Sometimes I feel I know too much to believe that stuff, I wish it were true. To me a crystal is just a really organised structure of atoms which looks shiny lol. It‚Äôs pretty cool to find them or other rare stones but."
4391,isfp,"I'm not much of a crystal believer but I do carry one crystal with me, a piece of black tourmaline. (I've read about black tourmaline online and I guess I felt really compelled to buy it and try it out. Courtesy of tert Ni) 
Anyway, a lot of those traits sound like they could be ISFP. Particularly the badly affected by negative events part. I'm not sure about natural hugger and healer/psychic part though. Also, I agree with you that the indigo/crystal child belief can be egoistical, it's so easy for people to identify with those because they sound special, I'm personally very skeptical about whether I really am an indigo child or anything of the kind myself.
Edit: It might be possible that I am one, or at least I'm open to being one, I just wouldn't know."
4392,isfp,"I agree with all this. I will say I‚Äôm open to the idea that we‚Äôve been aliens in past lives, but the starseed thing seems like something ppl say to feel special. I just don‚Äôt like how they say they‚Äôre so ‚Äúrare‚Äù and ‚Äúa new wave of humans.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if humans have been aliens in past lives for pretty much the entirety of our existence bc the universe is so old. Again, idk though but open to the possibility."
4393,isfp,"I always wanted to be a musician for the pit orchestras on braodway. Didn't work out too well because I wasn't willing to put in the time and effort to really master the craft of music. It's still a hobby and I find any opportunities that I can still play here and there.A
Now I'm going to school to be a biochemist and it's working out really well. I'm excited to work in the field even though it's not my ""artistic"" passion.
Do you make your living as a full time ""artist"" and get a low paying job in order to feel happy or are you okay with working a common job to live comfortably? Maybe you tried following your passion but failed and ended up like me or other opposite: you ignored your passion and got a dead beat job somewhere that you now hate."
4394,isfp,"I'm a writer but I write smut because smut pays well and I can crank it out easily. I personally find it makes me feel good to be working in a field that aligns with my passions and skills, even if it's not how I imagined I'd become a writer when I was growing up.
So I guess kinda both :P I don't think I could have a mind-numbing office job working day in day out on things I don't care about. It sounds like you've been able to find a passion and excitement in biochemistry. 
At one point I thought about entering the field of biology. I quickly lost interest - but chemical and biological science is probably much more interesting to an ISFP IMHO than physics or engineering for example."
4395,isfp,"It's weird that I'm ISFP because I base my major life plans in the most logical, most likely to succeed ones. I'm trying to be a nurse so I can have a career, and then I'll be able to afford traveling. I don't want to be 30+ still bartending. "
4396,isfp,"I read somewhere that ISFPs are often drawn to the weird when it comes to art. Like ugly, creepy, or just off things. So I was kind of curious what would happen if I started a thread about artistic tastes! It could be music, movies, visual art, writing... anything! It doesn't even have to be weird, I just wanted to say where I got the idea for this. Maybe it's your favourite piece, maybe it's one you think other ISFPs would like, or maybe you just feel like sharing a particular one now. Aaaand... go!"

4400,isfp,"We've known each other for over 3 months and he's been wonderful ever since I met him. It was quiet and subtle but over that time he made me feel important and admired and respected. It wasn't until 3 weeks ago that I realized that I had grown feelings for him that were beyond friendship.
The issue for me is that now that I realize that I ache to continue that connection beyond work and  video games I don't know what to do. I know that my extroverted nature can sometimes be overwhelming to more introverted people, though I'm definitely solidly in the middle of the spectrum, so I find myself trying to respect his space by insinuating that I would like to spend more time with him but leaving it in his hands. 
From what I've been reading today this seems like this might be the wrong approach?
All I know is that he willingly spends more time with me than he needs to, once we even spent 2 hours in extremely hot car that didn't have air conditioning just talking and learning more about his family and life. It also seems that every week we're getting a little closer.
There are times I am certain he shares my fascination and enjoyment but things are moving so slowly that I wonder if he even notices that I might like him as more than a friend. I support the idea of taking things slowly, especially after some of the bad things I've experienced, but it makes me wonder if I'm not communicating my intentions in a way that is understandable. I just like him so much that I become much shyer and subtler than I intend to be.
I also wonder if maybe he's giving me the exact cues I need to see that he's interested but I just don't see them clearly enough.
I want nothing more than to respect his space, even more so because it seems his long-term GF broke up with him two months ago because he wanted to spend more time with his friends. I also want to do what is necessary to show that if he did want to spend more time with me, through dates and the like, that I would cherish every moment that he was comfortable sharing. But, I also want to ask him if he wants to do 10,000 different things just to see if he's actually interested in any of them!
I also meaningfully tell him how much I appreciate his art and the time I spend with him as much as I can without causing myself to feel too vulnerable and he always seems to meaningfully appreciate the gestures I make.
I think, at the end of the day, my best case scenario is a relationship where I feel safe and loved but we also do our own things so I can give him the alone time that he needs. I just really want to have the opportunity to cuddle with him on the couch while we're watching movies, playing games or discussing our shared interests but I worry that admitting that out loud would make any introvert want to run. Especially in these early stages and also without confirmation that he isn't still (understandably) pining over his ex.
I don't think that I would be as antsy about things except for the fact that in a couple of weeks our schedules will change and unless he wants to purposefully schedule time that we can be together and hang out, I'm not going to see him very often anymore.
TL;DR: I'm enthralled by the idea of getting into an established relationship with a probable ISFP but I don't know where to start and I'm afraid of pushing him away. I believe he's into me by the things he says to me and his actions but I don't know how to tell for sure and I am scared to death that I'll lose him from my life when our schedules change in a couple weeks.
Thank you all for you help : I just don't know what to do or who to turn to for advice and I really want to keep him in my life for as long as he would like to be there."
4401,isfp,"For me (male ISFP), if someone straight up tells me they're interested in me, I feel one of two ways. One possibility is the feelings aren't mutual and I try to let the other person down easily and end up feeling bad about it. The other possibility is that the feelings are mutual, and I'm immediately happy and much more forward.
So that's my suggestion, as it's easier and by far much less trouble than trying to drop hints and wait for him to do something. Personally, I'd probably pick up on the hints, but it would still require a lot more motivation to do anything about them than it would to respond positively to someone telling me straight up.
Either way, the only reason I wouldn't like someone being direct is not being interested in them. I do like having plenty of space, but if I'm interested in someone I'm by default willing to make exceptions.
That said, results may vary, but I always think it's better, and more attractive, to take the bull by the horns. "
4402,isfp,"I'm glad to hear that! I much prefer being direct but I've just had such odd results from with other people in the past that I've become super gun-shy. So, your comment makes me feel even more confident that I can relax and just be myself again.
The only concern I have left is that he's  so fresh out of this last relationship.
I've been pumping the brakes because I felt that I would be disrespectful of his feelings if I told him I was interested in him before he had a chance to decide he was ready for something new.
Is there any better way to keep his possible feelings in mind, within the context of letting him know my interest in starting a new relationship with him?"
4403,isfp,"Again, this is just my view, but once I'm out of a relationship, all I want is to move on. I'm not one of those people that's going to stay out of a relationship for a long time because I just got out of one. So if someone I like tells me she's interested in me, I'm just going to go for it and see what happens. 
I don't really know how to walk interpersonal tight ropes like some people can. The best I can do is to approach a situation honestly, and with good intentions. If that's not good enough, it's probably not good for me to be connected with that person anyway. Because of that, I thoroughly appreciate when people take that approach with me. 
Anyway, that rambling is all supposed to mean that I'm not really sure how you can tell him you're interested in him while at the same time making sure he's not still caught up in his last relationship. However, I don't think being honest about what you're feeling and what you want would be a problem in itself."
4404,isfp,"I'm not really sure what you're asking. It seems like you're in a long distance relationship with him already if you're talking every day, telling each other you love the other, and about to go visit him in a couple weeks. I'd say it's normal male ISFP behavior to want to spend time with the girl he loves, have fun together, and connect more deeply. 
All that aside, I'm going to assume that you were in a relationship before, he had to leave, and he formally broke it off because he doesn't want to be in a long distance relationship. If he's still in love with you, which I'd assume he is, of course it's normal to want to see you and do all that stuff together. I wouldn't assume it means he's considering committing to you despite the distance, but it definitely means he still really wants to spend time with you and cares a lot about you. ISFPs generally don't go out of their way to spend time with people they don't like, especially when it's as complicated as bringing someone to a completely different country.
Since you said you want to ask male ISFPs about how we feel about long distance relationships, I'll give my thoughts on that too. If it's for the right person, absolutely. But when I say ""right person"", that's a very strict definition at this point in my life. Regular relationships are just more fun for many reasons, so I'm more likely to take chances on those than I am on long distance relationships. Relationships can bring as much or more pain than they do happiness, and I'm reluctant to commit to them in general, but the quality of time spent together is just so much higher in regular relationships that they're more worth a risk.
Anyway, let me know if you want to clarify or if I made some wrong assumptions, and maybe I can try to help a bit more. "
4405,isfp,"You're seriously the best <3 You gave me enough confidence to open up and tell him that I don't want to push him because I know I can be pushy by mistake but that I really enjoy/want to hang out with him and I that I really want to get to know him more and he grinned and said ""I really want to get to know you more too.""
It was restrained still, but completely honest because that's what the next step in this whole thing would be, and it gave him room to easily slide out of it if he weren't comfortable.
So anyway, you've made the life of a random person you may never meet better than it would have been if you were never in it :) and she deeply thanks you for it!"
4406,isfp,"I'm just glad I get to see good results! I've tried to answer questions like this before and never heard how it turned out in the end, so it's nice to hear that it's gone well for you. Good luck going forward!"
4407,isfp,"I'm not really sure how you should do it, but I think it's definitely something you should bring up, but that's just part of my personal views on relationships. I think it's important that both sides understand what the other wants. I'm honestly surprised he hasn't brought it up. I would want to know whether there is a commitment there or not so I could figure out how I should be living my life. Definitely don't take this as gospel, but my assumption is that he considers the situation as a committed, long distance relationship already and is very serious about you. 
For me, ""right person"" isn't something that has a concrete definition or bubbles that have to be filled, it's just a feeling I have. I realized this after actually being in love for the first time in my life. I'd dated girls before, but it never really felt like a huge deal. It was something I did because it was a social norm. Now that, after seriously being in love with someone, I know that such strong feelings are possible, and I know what it feels like to have a ""right person"". Basically, I'd just have to be completely and helplessly in love, and be sure that this is a person I want to give my all and sacrifice everything for. 
To elaborate on why I think long distance relationships are only worth it for the ""right person"", it's not because of the lack of physical intimacy. It's more about the other things you can do and experience together when together in the same place that you can't long distance. I'm someone that constantly wants to be doing new things and having fun, and in my experience that's not something I can do as much in a long distance relationship unless it's with that ""right person"". "
4408,isfp,"I hate not having closure so I couldn't leave you hanging! 
I appreciate the luck and I have a feeling that it will continue to go really well. I'll be sure to send you a shout out if/when we start dating, hehe."
4409,isfp,"I don't quite know what I should do in uni/life in general. There are lots of courses and careers I'd say I'm INTERESTED in, but nothing I'm absolutely head over heels crazy over. 
Do you guys here feel this too? What did you end up doing and how did you decide?"
4410,isfp,"I'm in the same boat. I've been working working construction for 3 years since I graduated high school and pretty much hated every second. I took classes for CAD and art, but nothing really caught my attention. Psychology has always interested me. Recently decided to live out of my truck and save money to travel. I'm just not sure if that is really a smart life decision and also of I'm just doing that to escape life for a year or two. That doesn't really answer your question, but I relate to your sitch."
4411,isfp,"I switched majors a million times before settling on art and design, because I needed to stop switching if I was going to graduate on time. I like my work in some ways, I do a lot of Photoshop and Illustrator, but I get really bored and restless sitting quietly on the computer all day every day.  I'm thinking of switching my career field, two years out of college, to something less monotonous.  So. ... just know that you have your whole life to explore and figure it out, and sometimes the only way to know what you like or dislike is by trying different things. "

I think that key to a good job for ISFP are coworkers.
I personally am a Software Developer. I am into Computer-related jobs since I was 16. I really like software development because it fulfils my inner need for art - my code is my art! I really appreciate my code, and hate on bad code (bad/ugly art for me). "
4413,isfp,omg...this is an old comment but isfp sub is so dead so screw it.  Anyway I just wanted to say this is completely me right now...got an art degree but I'm at a weird standstill where I'm not sure if I want to do something else.
4414,isfp,"I used to test as INTJ when I was in highschool and I haven't really changed in terms of how I act. INTJ's tend not to reveal themselves and enjoy being alone. They can get uncomfortable in over stimulating environments. I feel like ISFP's and INTJ's would get along.
Thoughts?"
4415,isfp,"I've also tested as INTJ before. It seems to me that ISFPs think about their emotions and things of personal importance in the same way that INTJs think about ideas and long reaching plans. We're both introspective types that individually and in a unique fashion follow what we enjoy and believe.
Also INTJs and ISFPs share the same cognitive functions, but in a different order, so there's that too."
4416,isfp,"Same here, sometimes if your functions aren't completely healthy/underdeveloped -for me it was a resisted Se, an overindulged Ni and a Chronic Defensive Loop and ended up identifying with INTJ as a result- it can throw you off and cloud your understanding of your A)overall behavior B)thought process, since you would unconsciously dismiss your natural functions from acting.

i have an ENTJ friend, and we certainly get along. On the other hand I have an INTJ nephew... and he's a lot more cruel than i like in a person. ENTJ is fairly matured and had learned how to socialize very early on, so he knows how to act more likable (when he wants to..). INTJ is still very young, but I'm pretty sure this is his typing. I humor them both by talking about certain theories that they have, though it's difficult to understand why they care about such ideas... for example, the INTJ thinks Dory from Finding Nemo is actually evil because he thinks she's faking her amnesia(?). "
4417,isfp,"Hi all, ENFP here. I have an ISFP brother who I'm very close with but often have a lot of trouble communicating with. Recently, I went through something pretty upsetting and my way of dealing with it is trying to understand the other person better and why they did what they did. (Hence why I'm interested in MBTI). He gets very annoyed at me when I do this and tries to get me to connect more with my feelings in the present moment. I understand the value in this, and it's helped me a lot, but I also don't think that trying to understand the other person is necessarily a bad thing. But when he does this (he tells me that I'm being dumb and annoying when I do this), he makes me feel very ashamed and down. I'm trying to understand why he would say or do this. I feel like it has to do with an undeveloped function that's more developed in me?"
4418,isfp,"ISFPs seem to get pretty close minded and set in their ways when annoyed, angry or upset. I know I am. 
Basically, we don't get Ne at all and under the previously mentioned circumstances we'll just be like ""screw that shit, just act normal"". 
I say just do you, and perhaps try to understand each other better in more relaxed circumstances, things go way easier then."
4419,isfp,"Honestly I don't have a clue, but I do notice ExFPs have some sort of delay with regards to emotions, IxFP notice them first and act later, while ExFP seem to act first (whether through Ne or Se) and notice them later."
4420,isfp,"For the past couple months, I've become good friends and developed romantic feelings for a girl with the isfp personallity type. I'm a male infp, and I've thought so much about asking her out, but everywhere I look, people talk about hoe incompatable isfp and infp relationships are. I don't often buy into stuff like that, but it's still fairly doscouraging. Should I put in time into the relationship, or are these type of personalities so incompatible that it's not worth the time?"
4421,isfp,"Hi
I know your post is old but I‚Äôm in the same boat myself, f/INFP to a m/ISFP. 
Out of curiosity, did things work out? I kinda wanna tell him I like him but idk what to do. If you don‚Äôt I understand. Good luck!"
4422,isfp,"I am an ISFP myself. 
My ISFP Gf of 16months last week said no to hanging out, which she never does without an explanation and said she wanted to call me, which she doesn't usually do. I knew something is up and she will prob break it off. She has been acting distant and looked in grief for the last 2 weeks. 
She eventually called and said that she can't see me anymore. I didn't know what to say, didn't want to seem needy and said ok. She asked if that's all I have to say. I said yes and then we said bye.
Sometimes I think she wanted me to talk to her about what was the problem. We are both isfps and bad with verbal communication so I think this wasn't the healthiest way.
We were close to each other and showed alot of care. It was the first long term relationship for both of us. 
Popular advice is to cut all contact and forget about her and start getting taking care of yourself and move on. But I sometimes think things could have ended differently. 
I know we were getting bored of each other as identical personalities would, but I don't feel like this is the best way to deal with it. "
4423,isfp,"Use your words. 
Ya'll have been together 16 months and your response seems more in line with someone telling you they're not gonna make it to the annual christmas party this year. Just based off this you seem slightly indifferent about it?? 
Being your first relationship, you should talk to her when you have your emotions sorted and find out ""her side of the story"". (assuming it didn't end with cheating or something nefarious). Take the bits you feel are relevant and try to ""learn"" from it. "
4424,isfp,"Yeah, I definitely recommend gently approaching her/texting and asking her for an opportunity to talk with her and ask her what's up. I'd also try to somehow make it apparent that she doesn't have to speak about it if she isn't comfortable--maybe offer to do something she finds relaxing with her so she can sort of ""unload""? She certainly seems to be holding stuff back. Hang in there!"
4425,isfp,"it is a 2 way street, which is why it's frustrating when the other person offers next to nothing. i've seen threads here and other places from ISFPs saying ""why am i so boring"" ""why can't i talk"" and i genuinely wonder like... why can't you? the other person can't be doing ALL the work. i understand not everyone is the same, just my personal experiences with ISFPs "
4426,isfp,"if you want to boil it all down to that, whatever floats your boat. i like them. i just don't see how a lot of them post things about their inability to communicate, yet refuse to take the leap and do so "
4427,isfp,"Well, ability and wanting to do so can be two different things at times. 
It does seem as if you're able to do both at a competent level so perhaps from your point of view it seems like a reasonable thing? 
Being an ISFP myself there's certain personalities/people that it does seem like there's a roadblock/forcefield up when it comes to communication. I'm not talking friendship level, but just day to day interaction. "
4428,isfp,"Only with certain people. On the ISFP spectrum, I'd consider myself a tad more outgoing than most of our sort. Certain people just seem like a brick wall in communicating with them and it's a struggle though. I'm (42M) and I believe (hopefully) that I've shored up this weakness to where I will attempt to bridge that gap now. It sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Again, the types I struggle with usually fall in a category of continued interactions in work/hobbies that kind of thing, and not much more than acquaintance types. Certainly nothing deeper... 
On the flip side, I do search to ""go deeper"" with most of my closer relationships and have no issues talking about what's making me tick with the people who have I've ""let"" have access into that ""circle of trust"". I also have zero problems approaching issues that seem off or where I need to clear the air with the co-workers/people in my life. "
4429,isfp,"My bf is an INFJ. I like that our relationship has been awesome and that he is sweet and understanding. We get along well and there's a lot of promise. We're both incredibly drawn towards each other. 
I dislike that sometimes we can have different communication styles and that there's 10 hours of difference between us, so we have a hard time finding a time to talk with each other (without either one having to compromise their schedule)."
4430,isfp,"My partner is xNFP (thinking more I than E). I like that he talks to me a lot, we have the same sense of humor, he is down to go on adventures with me no matter how small and that we understand each other really well. 
I dislike that we can both be a little insecure about our relationship at times (thinking one person likes the other less, etc) but other than that I feel like we‚Äôre a good match"
4431,isfp,"ESTP
He's reliable, committed, funny, considerate/sweet, and we have almost perfectly matching values.
‚Äã
I wish he'd do some new stuff with me, and was more romantic.
Also, our communication styles are soooo different, we can have the same underlying opinion about something but come at it from different angles, completely missing each other's points until we talk about it for 5x as long as we need to. Actually, not sure this is a negative, it's super fun and interesting."
4432,isfp,"Can be your experience with them, opinion on the users, etc.

Fe: Overall, when used in a positive way I like it and I always do my best to go along with it and avoid conflicts, but I tend to find it a really annoying function sometimes, as well (mostly lower Fe, though), like when someone blames themselves for everything, hates themselves and the things they like, and feel everyone else is superior to them. I just can't understand that mindset, that you think the things you believe in are worthless and your only sense of self-worth is how good you are to others. Or when group values are treated like the holy texts and personal values are shunned and treated like sins. Just no, please. Very hit or miss, basically. But overall I don't clash with it often.
Si: I actually know very little about this function, probably the function I know least about. Overall I just go ""meh"" when I see it pop up. The only thing I dislike for sure about Si is the fact that they can be very conservative.
Ne: Together with Ti, probably my least favorite functions. I find that the users often have this indirect ""holier than thou"" vibe, they always feel the need to be all quirky and deep and tend to be rather patronizing towards people with bad Ne, dismissing them as shallow, because oh no, you don't consider the 10 billion other methods you can put mustard on your toast. It's a bit in the same ballpark as Fe when used negatively, imo, it justs seems rather fake and tryhard to me most of the time. I do like a few things about Ne users, though, first off I enjoy the fact that they can deal with whatever you want to talk to them about (Si and Se users tend to ignore me when I ramble on about games or Dragon Ball, for example), they're also very open to people that don't find the mold (I'm autistic and I think pretty much everyone who judged or bullied me for that was ESTP, and while I don't get along with ENTPs at all, they at least didn't attack me for that aspect).
Ti: The ""I understand how it works, but I can't fathom actually being like that"" function. In a way, it's the most simple function in the sense that it's easy to understand how it works, but it's the hardest function to understand why someone would actually want to use it. Obviously, as Fi doms we are very driven and place a ton of importance on our opinions, feelings and impressions, whereas Ti is painfully clinical and apathetic. It's kinda like the system inside a game which decides whether you're game over or not, the game doesn't care at all, it just decides based on what's logical or not. Overall I'm okay with it, but I do sometimes find that people who use Ti can get a bit scary, especially when INTPs or IxFJs use it, it's kinda like their face displays how dead inside they are or something. Maybe I'm looking into it too much. What I find weirdest is how they can be so apathetic and not let their emotions influence them even in the slightest. Like I understand that you don't want to act on them, but like.. how can you not even be aware of them? Mystifies me."
4433,isfp,"Great post, thank you. I resonate a lot with what you said, especially about the Ne and Ti functions. For me it's like this:
Fe: A hit or miss function with me really. I appreciate it at times and I strive to cultivate more of it myself but other times it can piss me off. For example, when all they seek is positive affirmation from others and never really accept anything negative. It also can be quite circlejerky (if Fi = self pride, then Fe = group pride). I also don't like how much emphasis there is in being other-oriented, I personally think people would be happier and there would be much less drama if people would be a bit more self oriented (not selfish). Being focused on others is not always a positive thing, people can focus on others and ""be selfless"" in a really bad way. For example, in a game there's a person who only focuses on sabotaging other's efforts instead of focusing on their own. That's a bad way of being other-centered. That's also one of the ways bad Fe can seem bully-like, they prey on the vulnerable and laugh at their pain to boost their own ego for being so emotionally unaffected. 
Si: A function I don't really understand. Just what it is, physical comfort, memorizing, traditions, the past, existing structures? I guess the best way for me to understand it is doing mundane tasks and being comfortable with it. I mean, Ne hates that stuff right? They want everything to be unconventional. I guess I kind of see Si as a conservative function. 
Ne: I've had so many Ne users in my life that I'm basically surrounded by them. I have an ISTJ mom, ENFP brother, a couple of INxP siblings, my friend group consists of three talkative Ne users and a couple of Ni-Se people. I've also had several INFP friends. I'd say, out of all people I've come in contact with, the Ni-Se users understood me the most. But I think that should be obvious. I don't exactly hate Ne, except when, like you said, they have that ""holier-than-thou"" attitude. I also can find it exhausting to be around Ne people for long periods of time, I can't handle having long drawn out conversations, I need physical stimulus every now and then. (This doesn't mean that I can't be in an isolation tank, I think I'd actually do quite well inside of it, it's just that my primary focus of extroversion is on the physical rather than ideological. 
Ti: Another function that I either appreciate or find highly annoying. I dislike Ti when it's unhealthy. An example of an unhealthy Ti person would be one guy that's in our school and goes to the same class as my two INxP friends. He's a very quiet and withdrawn guy, but holds a lot of questionable beliefs, thinks he's far more intellectually superior and right than everyone else, bases his relationships with people on his own logical perception of the world and holds the perception as the ""ultimate truth"" to everything, and even mocks other people's way of behaving in friendships because he thinks his way is much better. Oh and then he acts victim when his own beliefs and methods of what friendships should be like are rejected. Overall a disgusting guy. 
To me Ti to Fi is kind of like Si is to Ni. In general I might find Ti quite boring, but I can see how it's necessary. But also I can loathe the intellectual circlejerk surrounding it (resulting from low Fe probably) and the quiet arrogance behind it. To me superiority complexes and arrogance are just the worst when people refuse to confront their arrogant beliefs and just hold it inside their heads. 
Thankfully my female INTP friend isn't like that though. I adore her."
4434,isfp,"Fe-- I really can't stand it.  It's exhausting and at times, disingenuous, used to keep peace and to keep awkwardness at bay when someone who hasn't earned the right to my real opinion tries to engage me.  So I guess in that regard, it's a pretty useful shield, but I certainly don't like using it.
Si-- It'll just come up out of nowhere and I'll start feeling crappy about some past thing I've long since dealt with and I know it's not me and it's completely irrational so I just need to wait it out.  It doesn't usually take too long to pass, as long as I don't give it an opportunity to become my present again.  Sometimes manifests in odd ways, like not liking the new Nintendo controller because it doesn't feel like the old one did.  Small, seemingly random details will jump out at me, and I'll remember weird bits of old conversations (but if I bring it up, no one ever believes me because people also think I don't listen).  It's an interesting one, Si.  My relative lack of it means when someone asks what I've been up to, I draw a complete blank and look like a boring idiot. lol.
Ne-- This one often feels more natural to me than Se, like in conjunction with tert. Ni, you can't go deep without also going wide, and I often feel more in the clouds than fully present.  It's still pretty immature though, and presents pretty wonkily, filtered through Fi and all that.  It's like the world is filled with all these wonderful, unanswerable questions and the possibilities are endless and that's part of the beauty of it-- like did we discover math, or did we create it as a means to try and understand?  All I know is that everything is connected and the questions and theories surrounding how make it all the more fascinating.
Ti-- I feel like I use this quite a bit even though it never shows up on those tests.  It's kind of like this-- in order for a feeling to pass muster, it needs to reconcile logically (and logically does not mean empirically).  If I can't make sense of the feeling, I examine it until I can or I throw it out.
Cool question, btw :)"
4435,isfp,"ENFP here - as an Ne dom, the way you describe Ne is how it shows itself in many people, but it's not actually what Ne feels like. Ne is simply the ability to associate. So when you say something, it will instantly remind me of something else. Our mind is like a connected web of ideas. But instead of ideas going deeper and deeper (Ni), it extends outwards. It's like one of those word webs you see online. Someone on reddit described it as a prospector looking for gold over wide swaths of areas, while Ni (which is in your stack) is about digging deep in one area to look for the gold. Ne is like Se in that it's exploratory, but it's more ideas based than sensation based. I feel like it's the learning function - when I'm trying to learn something new I can do it pretty fast by reading as much as I can really quickly. I have a very good initial intuition about how something works because I can absorb other peoples' mindsets, but when pressed, I can't explain it very well or do it very well compared to experts. 
‚Äã
I think Si (the last function in my primary stack) is very similar to Se in that we pay a lot of attention to details, feelings and sensations in the moment, but we don't normally use it to decide what we are going to do now. Instead, we store it for the future and when I'm trying to learn something new or create a new theory with my brother (ISFP), I try to apply the elements of that theory to experiences that I've had in the past to see if it matches. Sometimes I'll lie in bed and very very vivid memories will float up for me - it's very relaxing. I feel like Se is all about using sensory information to drive current actions/decisions - correct me if I'm wrong. (I'm actually not too clear on the difference between Si and Se and would love to learn more.) 
‚Äã
Hope that helps! "
4436,isfp,"So I'm an entj and subscribed to this sub because I wanted to understand the opposite of my functions. I am still learning about mbti so don't know much about it yet but had an idea that isfp is my shadow which sometimes I will become? (But an unhealthy version)I find if I get in a bad place that I become introverted in the sense of feeling shy and in my head and withdrawn, I generally loose my intuition and don't know how to understand things, my feelings become very overwhelming and I loose my judgment and can't make any decisions. I think my type is seen as unemotional, but often I am trying to protect my feelings when I lead with thinking over feelings on decisions."
4437,isfp,"I like your presentation on Ti. Because it totally makes sense that you would think that about it. Like, if I was an isfp I would maybe see it similarly. I would be wondering why is this person so clinical when they could be feeling more. Good post. -INFJ 6w5 "
4438,isfp,"Yeah, I've never actually tested isfp.  It was suggested to me by someone fairly knowledgeable, so I studied the functions and they check out for the most part, except for Ne.  My creativity is very Se though, stimulated by outside entities that I seek to reinterpret, rearrange, or recreate.  I wouldn't call myself imaginative but I do get inspired regularly and then I brainstorm around a particular subject and go from there.  I lack the caution that low Se affords.  It's like I use Ne and Se equally, so I'm not full on Sensor but not really iNtuitive, either, lol.  The thing that really says isfp to me is my weird, immature Si and its fairly negative, uncontrollable nature.
tl;dr Si id."
4439,isfp,"Ah, no, I think you (/they) actually got them a bit wrong. Seeking to reinterpret external things is Ne. Brainstorming is also Ne to some degree. If you find yourself engaging your thoughts and being inside your head most of the time, that's more indicative of Ne. Trust me, I'm an ISFP and I know how Se feels like and how different I am from the Ne users around me. 
As an INFP, it's possible for you to notice your surroundings, but not really ""being"" in your surroundings. Also, as an ISFP I can't say I brainstorm much. Brainstorming in general seems to be more of an Ne activity. Most often Ne users get distracted by brainstorming and forgetting the initial thing. Se users get distracted by noticing/wanting something new to do and doing it. 
Also, the bit you said about having weird, immature, negative Si... well, it's more of low Si than id Si. Id/demonstrative Si is like, you're good at it but you don't value or think about it. And you portray Si well outwardly. INFPs have the same thing, but with Ni, so they might seem very withdrawn and in their head meanwhile they might be thinking about what ifs. 
I hope this helped!"
4440,isfp,"I think we're coming from two different schools of thought.  I learned fifth position/switch is the one you're good at but don't care too much about it, hence why I find Fe exhausting.  Sixth/id is basic, incapable of maturing, and very powerful if it's out of control.
I mean, at the end of the day the system arranges us into these little four letter categories but our percentages are all different.  Based on your understanding, I could be infp.  I've tested infp, enfp, istj, istp, intj, and intp if you count 16p results but the function stacking of isfp most closely mirrors how I process shit.
Fwiw, some dude on here created this program that analyzes text and determines type based on words and word patterns.  He posted it on r/mbti.  Anyway, I tried it with most my comments on reddit and my results came back 96% isfp so idk, man.  One thing I will say is that I think a lot of isfps (istps, too) are hidden in plain sight because a lot of us do seem to be able to wield opposing perceiving functions fairly well.  I think it's part of what makes our types so misunderstood and such notorious loners."
4441,isfp,"Well do you see Pikachu and bananas? We don't, we just starting thinking about them. Like we'll think Pikachu for a split second because of the yellow and then we'll be reminded of something that we had just read about Pikachu and that will remind us of something else, like childhood movies in general and then we'll probably say something like - ""Isn't it weird that children's movies back then used to be much more etc. etc."" and you will have no idea how we came to that conclusion. Does that make a little more sense? "
4442,isfp,"Do you guys have any irrational fears? Things that logically shouldn't make you afraid but they do? Idk why but ever since childhood I've been scared of wasps and bees, especially big ones. I still tend to unconsciously flinch/freak out every time they buzz in close proximity to me (no offense, bees)."
4443,isfp,"Same, fear of bees and wasps, even though my grandpa is a beekeeper and I have to help out during summer (meaning almost daily contact with those buzzing f*ckers).
Edit: I mean I've been around them since childhood, I don't understand why I'm still so afraid of them :/"
4444,isfp,this started in elementary school and its been going on for about 9 or 10 years now. whenever i have to go in my front yard at night i'm terrified that a car will drive by and the driver will shoot me..its by far the most irrational fear i have lol. i can walk in other people's yard or walk in mine during the day but as soon as it's dark i get so afraid. it used to be such an overwhelming fear that i'd get panic attacks if i had to go out to my car or trash can. now its not nearly as bad but if i see a car i still have to either sprint back into my house or try hiding behind something so the driver can't see me and possibly shoot me. i honestly have no idea where this all started from and i know it makes absolutely no sense for me to be afraid but here i am lol 
4445,isfp,I fear large leaves (leaves bigger than my hand). It may be instincts or idk. I just cannot get near a piece of large leaf or those tropical plants (I'd freeze and want to cry) since the leaves are sooooo creepy and horrifying! Maybe its because I live in tropical places.
4446,isfp,"I had a bad phobia of museums for all of my childhood and I'm still not entirely sure why... Also had a fear of driving/cars, bugs, and thunderstorms. Had a fear of getting sick that got so bad it developed into an eating disorder (ARFID) and sent me to the hospital. I think it all stems from a fear of loosing control. "
4447,isfp,I saw king Kong (with jack black) in the movie theater when I was 6 and was scared that cannibles were in the bathroom and hallways so I couldn't take a bath by myself. And also I was freaked out for a while worrying that my reflection would not move with me and would attempt to kill me. Because of the movie mirror. This was sophomore year in high school and the fear comes back evey now and then. Up until that year I was afraid of the dark. And I was really interested in learning about aliens and was constantly fearing they would abduct me.
4448,isfp,Didn't have a problem with bees until high school. Doing marching band and had to keep still while a bee flew up my shirt and stung me. Since then when I see or hear them I'm running away fast ducking and jumping like it's gonna help.
4449,isfp,"Do you guys show affection to your close friends from the other gender? And how do you show it?
How different is it from the affection that you show your ‚Äúcrush‚Äù or someone that you like ‚ÄúRomantically‚Äù??
How do you act around the ones that you like romantically?
(A curious INTJ (f) regarding my ISFP (m) close friend)"
4450,isfp,I show affection to my close guy friends the same way I do w my girl friends I touch them and lean and hug (take in mine I legit have 5 friends total) I do not talk to my crush I‚Äôm way too shy for that so lol rip yeah 
4451,isfp,"I don't show much affection to my female friends, just seems kind of weird to but I don't know. with women I'm interested in I'm very playful and joke around a lot, but sometimes shy if I don't really know her or she doesn't seem into me "
4452,isfp,"I was  wondering if it would be appropriate to share our art on this sub. Alot of us are pretty critical of our own work, and wouldn't want to share it in some of the bigger subs. Thought that maybe we could share it with just our fellow isfps and what not."
4453,isfp,"You know, I've been thinking about this a lot myself too. I was thinking of creating an ISFP exclusive subreddit just for sharing art stuff that we did. Sooo, I will be watching these comments to see what everyone else thinks."
4454,isfp,"Actually that's a really good idea. I can adjust the weekly ""What's on your mind?"" posts to include art too. At least that's how we'll start, if it takes off I'll think about allowing art submissions directly to the subreddit or even creating a whole new one. "
4455,isfp,"Infps <3 but not the type that sees itself as a victim all the time. And not the type that blames sensors for all of life‚Äôs problems. I love my Infps :) so understanding, forgiving, and knowledgeable. Love their Ne and ability to see good in everyone and everything. "
4456,isfp,"In general, I mainly get along with xnfps, xntps, and other isfps. My best friends are all infps. Infps (and intps) are hella funny and their humor is typically very witty which I like. They think about literally everything at some point, and it is always interesting to hear the crazy shit that comes out of their mouths. I get along with enfps and entps great too, but my friendships with them aren't as close. "
4457,isfp,"ESFP, XNFP, INTPs, ISTPs... in theory ESFJs but I've never met one.
ISTPs - their bluntness can be endearing and it's sometimes just nice to hang out with somebody who's completely straight with you, and who doesn't spend all day talking/feeling themselves into circles
ESFP - so much fun, another type I like because they let me let go of some of my own ever-present worries and just focus on the 'now'
INFP - talking about emotions with another Fi dom is A++, I feel like INFPs 'get' me
ENFP - also tend to 'get' me, but more outgoing, which is nice when I don't feel like making all the decisions and being in charge... can be overwhelming though, as can INFPs, but less so.
INTP - generally about as spontaneous as I am (or at least able to go with the flow of my own spontaneity), inferior Fe pairs well with my Fi dom IMHO, goofy, relaxed people it's fun to hang out with who don't tend to get bogged down in emotions, tend to ramble, which can be nice if they don't expect you to be 100% focused on them
I'm least likely to get along with INTJs and ISFJ, for opposing reasons. ISFJs are too timid and people-pleasing, INTJs are too arrogant and self-centred.
Of course I'm speaking in generalities haha. One of my closest/long term friends is an INTJ, and we clash sometimes but she's genuinely a lovely human being. I think I could probably get along with somebody of any type, depending on how their MBTI type expresses itself."
4458,isfp,"I'm pretty sure my best friend is INTJ but I'm not the best at typing other people. I also get along quite well with his girlfriend, who I think is either ESFP or ENFP. Oh yeah I'm also very close with an INFJ. Also my (slightly) younger sister is an ISTJ and we get along whenever I'm not annoying the heck out of her with my fidgety quirks and inability to sit still and be quiet for more than 10 seconds. She's the person I tend to vent to about life problems because she has a better grip on how to break things down into step-by-step solutions, as well as because we're family and she knows pretty much everything about me.
I connect with the INTJ mostly through common interests and similar sense of humour. His gf because she asks deep questions straight off the bat and we have good meaningful discussions. And I get along with the INFJ for a combination of similar interests, meaningful conversations, and because we complement each other in that she can talk on and on about something whilst I prefer listening to contributing."
4459,isfp,"ESFP‚Äôs and ESFJ‚Äôs 
(they‚Äôre the type of people that I usually 99% of the time get along with, the other 1% where don‚Äôt get along with them is rare.)
Other ISFP‚Äôs will be a hit or miss (depending on values/beliefs) "
4460,isfp,"These are the answers i didnt expect but i fully agree anyway based on how i think of them. I actually have minimal interaction with istps because i dont think i know any unless my mom is. But for infps and intjs i have never met one before. And if u were to choose, which of these three would u really gel with if u were to stay with one for a year? "
4461,isfp,Nice that u gave me reasons to attach to each typeÔºöÔºâWould u say that infps are some of the greatest conversationalists because we share the same head and toe of functions? Or simply because they are very imaginative and some of us can keep up well? 
4462,isfp,"I see, there is a saying that esfjs bring out our fun side and that we are likely to like their personalities. I know an esfj at work too and she's so nice. Esfps are also fun and enjoy engaging our Se more. But yeah for isfps its always the values much agreed. "
4463,isfp,"I feel it's her imagination and patience with waiting for feedback. I'm quite guarded about my opinions and if I do share them I take awhile to find the right words to express them. It's nice not to worry about pressure of keeping up, or engaging at all, or coming back to a topic 2 hours later.
For me, it feels like the energy needed to find the right words that won't cause conflict/confusion is exhausting and I'd rather not do that...she gets it.
Hope that helps."
4464,isfp,"yes-- Many people who are close to me are infps :) I've met a lot of them and most of them give me good impressions at least. They tend to be very considerate of other people (to the point they get social anxiety) and don't really force their views on other people, unlike many other supposedly ""meek"" or ""kind"" types. In fact, they tend to blame themselves too much-- they tend to have more negative feelings about themselves (mostly unjustified) than other people. And-- they tend to be very smart and have similar interests to mine, which means we have a lot to talk about ;)"
4465,isfp,"hm.. well for esfj, i like how people focused they can be. especially for someone like me who is more reserved, it‚Äôs nice to have an outspoken esfj friend who will always look out for you. they also make me let loose, lol. i also think it‚Äôs easy to be honest with them and i think they appreciate that also. so that always makes for good friendships. to be honest though, sometimes they can get on my nerves. but from what i know about them, they for the most part always mean well (even if they‚Äôre wrong..), so i try my best to be understanding of them. 
for infps, i find that for the most part, how we think is very similar. also if discussing something, we tend to come at it from different angles, so i can always learn something new from them. not sure if that makes sense?? infp are just refreshing to me and i appreciate their ne a lot. it‚Äôs nice because sometimes they can be so deep, creative, etc. whereas i‚Äôm just very simpleminded xD 
so yea i just feel like esfj and infp are so easy for me to get along with!! they‚Äôre different from me in good ways. but at the same time very similar :) "
4466,isfp,"That does help. The understanding of one another is very important in any friendship. Plus enough time allowance given to reply a message should be understood by others but not everybody is willing to wait but Im glad she did. Looks like it's a blooming friendship with trust in yours, because u understand one another and give patience. "
4467,isfp,"Hm, hard to explain, probably because they tend to be on the same wavelength as me, just more practical and smart. I can hang out with INFPs and INTJs just fine, but I think it'll get a bit annoying if I'm with them too long. We're not that similar."
4468,isfp,"Okay so this is my first post on here so don‚Äôt judge me I don‚Äôt really know how this works, I‚Äôm a 25 year old female and he‚Äôs a 30 year old entp male we‚Äôve been together for around 8 months and I feel like we get along well but our relationship is kind of shallow like we almost never open up about our feelings and things like that we just discuss things like we‚Äôre in a business meeting, I don‚Äôt know how I can take the relationship to another level emotionally I feel like after 8 months it‚Äôs still kind of shallow what do you guys think? "
4469,isfp,"Hello. I am also an ISFP, & I have dated an ENTP. I had the exact same problem. We were together for 6 months before I finally realized that it wasn't going anywhere, & we broke up. We did a lot together, & it seems like a perfectly healthy relationship, but I just wasn't happy. I felt that our relationship had no meaning. Still better than when I dated an ENTJ, but that's another story.. Anyway, I am currently dating an INFP who fulfills me. I feel much better in this relationship. That all being said, I am not saying to just give up & leave. Are you happy? If you are, & just don't feel like you are getting everything you need, maybe talk to him about it. Any type is really capable of anything with enough effort. We can learn to be better at our weaknesses. However, if you really are not happy, it may be time to look for someone who you can better connect with. I really hope this helps, & you can DM me if you need anything else."
4470,isfp,"Familiar situation. My current SO types as ENTJ, we‚Äôve been together for almost a year and it took us about this entire time to open up to each other. From my perspective (ISFP) I internalize my feeling/emotions and express them with touch/acts. And he‚Äôs pretty similar but also has a hard time opening up emotionally. Almost called it quits a couple of times, but that forced us to actually communicate our feelings & open up with each other so it‚Äôs been better since then. 
So I would say it is possible to overcome and grow, if you‚Äôre both willing to be completely open and honest about expectations and mental needs not being met. It‚Äôs all about compromise. It‚Äôs worth having the conversation and trying to grow together. If there‚Äôs no growth after then I would just end it (personally) "
4471,isfp,"It is possible that things can change, which is why I said to not just give up if you are happy. You should try talking to him about this. See if he is willing to try harder to deepen the relationship. And while you are at it, ask him if there is anything you could be doing to improve the relationship as well. Things can definitely work out if you are both willing to work towards what the other needs. I just meant that if he isn't willing or able to try giving more, then you may be happier with someone else. But I would recommend trying to solve the issue before just walking away. In my case, the guy saw no need to improve in this way. Your guy may be willing to."
4472,isfp,"NT and SF are oil and water. Anecdotal but I was married to an ENTP for 10+ years and she was demanding, logical to the point of being illogical (hard to explain), not empathetic. ISFP's in my experience (again anecdotal) work best with a fellow SF or NF.  "
4473,isfp,"My ISFP friend [18M] broke up with his girlfriend [18F] 5 months ago, mainly due to religious differences. He was the one who confessed to her and was eventually broken up with, so he's obviously heartbroken.
He takes a lot of quiet time to think about life (emo) every night, which is understandable, but I'm not sure when this is too much. By that, I mean being sad too much of the time and it becoming psychologically unhealthy.
He gets reminded very easily by his ex, for example, we were talking about our idols/celebrities and he mentioned that his ex met a certain celebrity before, even though we weren't talking about this certain celebrity at all.
He also won't go to places where he and his ex has had memories together (understandable, but that's a lot of places).
Basically, she is still on his mind all the time. I've tried to give a little advice on some things that might help, but he tells me that they'll never work and he's gonna be stuck in this emotional state forever.
He's pretty self-aware that he's sad a lot and kind of jokes about it (like when I said ""tell me when you're sad"", he replied ""that's my secret, I'm always sad"") or saying things like ""being sad sucks"", ""life sucks"", etc. I think all these are pretty normal reactions to a break up, but at the same time, it's been 5 months and I'm wondering if that's a little too long to be majorly upset ALL the time.
We hang out sometimes, but mostly communicate through text. He's really a great friend overall and will listen to my rants any time. I'm just really worried for his wellbeing and I wish he has more hope to move forward in life.
Any tips on what I can say/do to help?
TLDR: My ISFP friend [18M] broke up with his girlfriend 5 months ago. He is:
- in a constant state of sadness
- always mentions there's no hope in life
- believes that he'll never be able to get over her because he liked her a lot.
I'm afraid for his wellbeing and will appreciate some advice :)"
4474,isfp,"Umm... ISFP(M) here, I guess it depends. For an ISFP, his behavior is kind of alarming because I think being in the FiNi loop (a destructive thinking pattern as a reaction to stress) can be pretty dangerous. It leads to a lot of self-compromising thinking/behaviors. I personally know for a fact that when I'm in this loop, my quality of life plummets into the ground and I have to FORCE myself to go on some nature walks or exercise or dance or paint or whatever to get out of it asap.
It's clear that the breakup was hard on him, and that's really sad, because Fi-doms tend to feel these negative emotions more intensely and seemingly longer than any other type. I would suggest you encourage him to do things that engage his Se (and maybe join him, but more as a social presence than anything else) and see how he responds. Best of luck to you and your friend though!!!!!! <3 "
4475,isfp,"I recently ended a relationship! I was quite sad for a while but a few things that helped me were 
1) I made a list of the reasons why we did not work out together. This included qualities I didn‚Äôt particularly like, fundamental differences, and memories of times when we clashed. 
2) I made a list of the ways I was held back in the relationship and what/who I could be on my own. 
3) I reminded myself of awesome the world is often. Even if I hated the world, I‚Äôd find some measure of beauty to focus on. 
4) I surrendered to fate. I told myself that these were necessary chapters in life that I needed to fulfill and they would lead me somewhere awesome. 
5) I got out and did something active and challenging on my own. I flew to the Grand Canyon and I hiked that bitch in one day. It took 12 hours (8 hours of straight hiking) and it was the hardest thing I had ever done. I felt immensely proud of myself afterwards. I spent the entire journey processing my emotions and practicing self-soothing. This trip was a significant part of my healing. For whatever reason, I ended up depending on my partner too much and it was like I forgot how to adventure on my own. This reminded me that I‚Äôm quite capable and strong and how much fun it is to have your own agenda and do things you want to do when you want to do them!!!
6) listened to new music
7) lots of exercise wth new music
8) I spent more time outside. If I wanted to read, I‚Äôd do it in a park instead of staying inside. 
9) I took up drawing and painting
10) I spent lots of time with friends and family.
11) I actually started journaling. It was very helpful to get thoughts out. 
12) I practiced mindfulness and meditation. On days I couldn‚Äôt meditate, I‚Äôd make sure to do more mindful mundane activities like mindful hand washing or mindful cooking.
13) I walked a lot biked around in different areas that were unfamiliar to me. 
I think getting in touch with your emotions and reining them in is very important. It‚Äôs so easy to get into a pessimistic loop of doom so it‚Äôs important to take control of your feelings and rewrire your thought patterns. I also think adding variety to you day is equally important. It reminds you how interesting the world is and how lucky you are that you have the rest of your life to see and experience neat and different things. "
4476,isfp,"(ISFP (F, tho)) My first relationship lasted less than a year and ended in a very, very messy way. It wasn't the only thing I was dealing with at the time, but it took me maybe 2 years to pull out of that funk.
That said, it's probably one of the best things that's happened to me. It got me going to the gym regularly (and eating better because of that), and I fell in love with kendo instead. Any sort of physical activity is great, because you can't be effective if you're not 100% there in the moment.
Writing a lot also helped...anything to help give form to the blob of feelings that seemed to envelop me. Also lots of karaoke. Nothing comforts like other people's heartbreak.
I think it's also important to nurture a balanced perspective. By all means, feel the emotions as they come. But when I missed the guy, it helped to remind myself that things ended for a reason, and of the things that weren't so great about the person/relationship. And when I got spiteful, it helped to remember the good things about it too -- we got together for a reason after all. I don't know if taking this approach prolonged the moving on process,  but I've seen too many friends use resentment towards the other person as a means to ride out the heartbreak period. They get back to acting normal very quickly, but whenever their ex comes up, it's clear things are still quite raw for them. I didn't want that for myself.
Hm, I wrote a lot. I don't know if this is applicable to your friend at all, but that's my $0.02 for ya."
4477,isfp,"Thank you so much! Yeah, I think he's constantly in then FiNi loop right now because nothing seems to get his mood up. I've tried encouraging him to do things he likes ‚Äî but he insists that they don't make him forget anyways, so they're pointless from his POV.
For things that engage Se, would you mind sharing some of the things you did that helped you?"
4478,isfp,"Thank you for taking time to reply! 2 years is a real long time. I'm glad you had so much strength and got over it eventually!
I'm trying to get him to get out of the house more ‚Äî hang with his friends or just chill so that he won't have an overbearing feeling of loneliness? I've tried getting him to write/read literature (because it really helps me too) but he doesn't seem too onboard with the idea :/
By the way, karaoke sounds like a good idea; I think I'll suggest that :) Thank you again for sharing about your experience!"
4479,isfp,"I think I've read somewhere that it'll generally take about half the time to get over someone, relative to how long you've been together with them (ie. together for 2 years, takes 1 year to get over it). Just a theory, but I think it's pretty true ‚Äî at least from what I've seen so far.
He was together with her for about 7 months."
4480,isfp,"Yeah! So just basically things that force him to be in the present and focus on the outside world. Like i said, hiking, exercising, dancing, painting. Adventuring. It's supposed to gradually feed our Fi (determines what we feel internally, our values) so that we have more of a balance than if we just stayed inside and had no sensory input at all."
4481,isfp,"Oh I see where you're coming from now! That makes a lot of sense. Just wondering, if you texted someone saying something like ""Life sucks"", along what lines will hope to see in the reply?
My friend tends to do that a lot and I find myself at a loss for words. Because I already know why he feels that way, so asking him to talk about it just won't do.
I don't really want to reply with something like ""Yeah I agree, your situation sucks"", because that's kind of ""feeding"" his sadness and I don't want to validate it more than I should. (or am I wrong about this?)"
4482,isfp,"Just curious, what type are you? I know the type of response I would want to hear would depend on the general personality of the person I talked to. 
In any case, I know if people fed into my negativity by affirming negative statements I said, it would probably make things a LOT worse. My late dad was ESFP, and anytime I complained to him about my skin, my lack of friends, feeling anxious/stressed, etc he would literally just say ""everything will be okay, don't worry, think positively"". That in itself was almost always enough for me to get out of that awful mindset and just start doing things again. So maybe just reassuring him repeatedly is a good idea? 
Ooh also, be GENTLE when doing this. If you try to come across as confrontational and/or aggressive in order to make more of an impact with what you're saying, it'll probably make things a lot worse because it'll make him feel like a burden. I don't know. Just use your best judgment and things should be fine :)"
4483,isfp,"I'm an INFx! (50-50 J/P) I think he brings out the slightly more extroverted side of me though, because I find myself talking a fair bit more around him. How will that affect the kind of response you would want to hear?"
4484,isfp,"I am still finding out my real type, but someone here in Reddit told me that I am most likely an IxFP (instead of an INTP which I thought I am). 
So yeah, here I am looking for inputs from others I guess. Maybe a person who really identifies with the ISFP personality can explain what sets his/her type apart from an intuitive? How did you know for sure you aren't an INFP?"
4485,isfp,"When you're an ISFP and you interact with INFPs, you realize you aren't speaking the same language at all. At times  You feel somewhat ""distanced"" from them, even if they're your good friends. Their humor, their questionings, their way of thinking is different from yours. I've felt I could've been an INFP, but their Ne is something I don't quite get. I'll give you an example. When I'm with INFPs, I find that they often talk about things I wouldn't even consider. They can get philosophical for hours, while I can only be philosophical with things that I would apply to my life. Not that I have intellectual laziness, but I don't think there's an use in pondering whether desire is a sign of human imperfection or not.
They're more off in their own fantasy world than I am in mine, and our inner worlds are different too. They are more likely to come up with new suggestions, original species, things that couldn't work in real life, whereas I'm very ""concrete"" in my mind. If I have to make something up, it has to have a root somewhere in reality. I'm not much of a daydreamer, I can't spend hours fantasizing like they can. My daydreams have a root in reality, again. I don't think much about utopia-like scenarios, if that makes sense.
I put a big emphasis on staying in touch with the real world because the thing of losing myself in fantasy scares me (and I've had delusions several times in my life). I have to feel things physically. I don't like reading because it helps me ""escape"". I like it because I can imagine things the way I want to, I can feel the paper on my fingers, and I can smell the book. I do have escapist tendencies once in a while, who doesn't? I smoke cigarettes. But not because they give me an escape from reality. It's because of the gesture, the way it feels, the very ""action"" of smoking. Also because I can sit down and focus on the moment."
4486,isfp,"If i didnt have such an intensely INFP sister i would think im infp because i always test out as infp. We are similar in loads of ways but we are super different in functions. By comparing the two of us i kinda know for sure that im isfp over infp so heres kinda how i know. Its an essay, im sorry.
My sister and her classically infp-ishness: 
She really does have that imaginary world in her head. She writes comics and always has since she could pick up a pen. Her characters seem really alive and they live in a detailed place inside her mind. Then theres the morals. THE MORALS. she has always been really driven by her morals. I consider myself really moral driven as well but with her its way more deeply ingrained. Idk how to explain it. She is a great writer and musician and artist. She is deeply deeply empathetic. She is hypersensitive and diagnosed with bipolar. She uses Ne. The Ne is strong. Idk how to explain it but i can see it. The way her mind jumps from thing to thing is different from how mine does. Its really just a different way that she thinks. She says stuff that my mind would never come to think of. Its not to say that her mind is better or smarter because i in turn say things that her mind would never come to think of. We're just different. Shes just more outlandish. More ""out there"".
Now theres me! Ive also got a deep creative streak. Ive been making stuff since i was a kid, ive always had a knack for drawing it and picked it up fast. I also write music and sing. I too can get ""deep"" and ""philosophical"" in my art but its different from the ways that my sister does. The meanings in my music tend to bubble up from the inside from the subconscious which i think is Ni. I write in a sensory way by which i mean i form lyrics based on the physical sounds of the words and the meaning get put together later. Se drives my art making where Ne drives my sisters art making. I keep saying it's hard to explain.  But it is. I can see the differences tho.
Ive always been more down to earth. I can see things more realistically. growing up i was more socially capable because i was more grounded in the world. The Se allowed me to be aware of social nuances in the moment so i could use that and act ""normal"" easier. My sister was completely inept at this. 
I could go on but ill spare you from that.
So yeah! I also highly recommend you take a functions test! Those are pretty helpful. But by comparing myself with my sister i started seeing where the differences were and our functions stacks stuck out to me.
Also i just didnt identify with the infp descriptions completely. I didnt identify with the isfp descriptions either because they all suck ass. "
4487,isfp,"Both creative, but one is ideas, metaphors; the other is sensuality, texture, aesthetic. Some bridge the gap well, I think, like David Lynch - who I guess is an INFP, but has a strong aesthetic (but still, I feel it serves the idea, or the fantasy/creation/nostalgia). ^^^Bjork ^^^is ^^^another ^^^tricky ^^^one, ^^^I ^^^think.  
Whereas, someone like Lana Del Rey, ^^^who ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^know ^^^much ^^^about I think of as being lead by the vibe, the lushness. About creating, luxuriating in the moment, in the texture of the creative moment."
4488,isfp,"Thanks for your comment. Can you give me an example of the things you philosophize about that you think INFPs most likely won't, and the things that INFPs you know philosophize about which you don't think you would think about at all?"
4489,isfp,"I can try to take a quick shower, but it is always a minimum of 10 minutes. I think it has to do with my perfectionist tendencies. Also when I used to work as a grocery bagger my manager would tell me to work faster. LEMME ENJOY MY TIME!!! ;'("
4490,isfp,Yesssss. Lol. I've learned that I have to give myself an hour to get ready in the morning and a lot of the time I'm late regardless lol. I just like to make every step of the process be enjoyable. Like I'll sit and search for a YouTube video to have on while I get ready. And I make my coffee. I just don't like rushing things!
4491,isfp,"I‚Äôm 5 minutes late everywhere I go! I just really like making sure I‚Äôm doing everything perfect! I‚Äôm a slow worker, but I feel like I make less mistakes and typos that the faster workers. If you‚Äôre more efficient then it‚Äôs worth it to me!"
4492,isfp,"I‚Äôm five minutes late everywhere I go! I‚Äôm definitely a slower worker, but I feel like I typically make less mistakes than some of the faster workers. I think efficiency is better, and more enjoyable once you reach the end! "
4493,isfp,"YES and it doesn't even matter if I make a point to speed it up.  It's like I operate entirely on my own clock and none of the js in my life get that.  They're always ""just be on time, it's not that difficult,"" or advising me to do little things to speed up my process, and it's like, No.  It doesn't work that way.  If it wasn't difficult to be consistently on time, I would've figured it out by now.  
The thing is, I work and complete tasks very quickly, which has earned me good reputations at every job I've ever had, and in my art, I've had to actively teach myself to slow down.  So it seems to be indicative of what I'm trying to do and whether or not I really want what's at the end, i.e. a finished task or art piece (I can be really impatient when it comes to myself).  Furthermore, being beholden to a set schedule is the worst and I can fake my way from the brink of suspension but can never make a solid routine rote. "
4494,isfp,"I remember I loved closing hour. Being able to clean at my own pace, for the most part. One time my manager told me the upstairs (staff lounge) should only take 30 minutes to clean but I took an hour. He did say I had good attention to detail, so I forgave him."
4495,isfp,"When I overthink, I begin to believe that things no longer have any value or meaning. For example, I think, ""what is the point of working?"" Yeah, it makes money and keeps me alive, but it sucks. I feel like a slave. I'm stuck in this system. I'm trapped. I'm gonna work until I'm old and then die. 
Living in the present comes naturally to me. The difficult thing about this is when you start to overthink, then I am living in overthinking land. And I can't stop stressing, worrying and making myself depressed and angry. You would think that someone that lives in the present wouldn't be prone to overthinking, but everyone is different. Also, being a feeler makes overthinking even more struggling. You feel all the negative emotions and really feel trapped. Sometimes it can get so bad that you think whether ending it all would be a good idea. Or worse, the only option.
Depression, anxiety and overthinking are all related. It's important to practice gratitude, meditate, ground yourself and focus on the positives. 
Maybe working at a job that you don't like isn't all that bad. You can find another job if you hate it that badly. Also, no job will ever be 100% perfect. There will always be something that you don't like about it. Or someone. 
Learn to accept things that you can't change. Be it family, the system that we live in, your personality, people's beliefs, etc.
Everything is either a blessing or a lesson. If something keeps haunting you, it means that you haven't learned to accept it. For example, I'm stuck living with my Mom and I dislike her negative energy and the drama that she causes. I desire to be in solitude, but I am too lazy and anxious to find a job and my own place. Things will keep reoccurring in your life, until you solve them. You can't run away forever. 
Typing this as I sit in my Mom's car, parked outside of Goodwill. She tried to force me to go inside with her, as she usually does with many things. Dragging me along with her. But I just ignored her until she gave up trying to force me. She just came back. Hope you enjoyed my ramblings/rant/thoughts/writing.
Bye now."
4496,isfp,"I overthink things a lot, but mostly decisions. I don't often have that existential crisis because I'm preparing for the future, and trying to achieve my ambition. Maybe it's just because of my passion that I can avoid this, but who knows"

4499,isfp,"So I've been dating a friend for the past month. She recently took a test and is ISFP. I've tested ENFP but am close to being an ENTP. We've been friends for about 5 or 6 years, and we ran with the same group of friends. She is very introverted and seems to be ok with listening to my whacky ideas and stuff I talk about. We don't see each other alot but we talk online off and on, because of her busy work schedule, but when we do hangout we have a lot of fun and she loves my affection and we get almost childish when intimate but it's great. She is really caring and loving. We also go on hikes together and she helps me go shopping. We see movies and have  alot in common. So I guess my point is is there anything I should know and any advice I should get?"
4500,isfp,"Things I learned from dating an ENFP (sorry if this sounds less than cheery): 
My advice is to be really careful not to trample on her. And I know you don't intend to do so, but the thing with ISFPS is that you won't even know you're trampling them because they're so gentle and tolerant that they will sacrifice their own happiness for yours without even realizing it. And she might have to make a very conscious effort to communicate her thoughts and feelings as honestly and unabashedly as you do, and you might have to make a very conscious effort to stop and listen when she talks, or when she doesn't talk. 
She may say things quietly and succinctly, but that doesn't mean any less than when you speak with all your enthusiasm and gusto.  Always encourage her to give her opinions and support her when she does. When you disagree, try to resolve things calmly. ENFPS sometimes have fun arguing, and you might feel like you can always win by being louder and feistier, but it will only lead to an unbalanced and unhealthy relationship.
It is already a good start that you're learning about her personality though :) my ex didn't believe in mbti, he basically compared everyone against the same standard and thought that all the ways I was different from him were just flaws that I needed to resolve. "
4501,isfp,"One thing I should say is in the future she may be wary of my drug use. I don't believe in using heroin or cocaine or anything like that but I'm an everyday Marijuana smoker and believe in the benefits of psychedelics alot. She seems to be really understanding of that stuff when I explain how I feel about it but I still think she subtly doesn't fully approve. She also doesn't smoke Marijuana much but has in the past, even with me and haven't in the relationship yet but she's open to doing it again in the future, it's just she got anxiety from doing it later on. she's also willing to tripsit me if I ever do anything so I think that's good."
4502,isfp,"I think MBTI is almost a god send, I've started being able to type people accurately before they take the test. I thought she was an INFP though, but thank you so much and I'll keep all of that into consideration. I try to listen to whatever she wants, and before I push my own likes/dislikes I try to see what shes into first. "
4503,isfp,"You make it sound like all ISFPs are type Nines? I am either type 3 or 4
ok not a big deal
seems reasonable
sounds like a dick"
4504,isfp,"Hey friend.
So I feel like I relate to her in some ways, so know this. One of the things I appreciate the most in life are people that I find it easy to hold conversation with. You might have noticed from poking around this sub, but conversation isn't always our strong suit, due to anxieties or whatever reasons, so the fact that you guys talk about whatever and seem to get along in that way is a very good sign.
I also did some drugs in past, largely smoking, but ended up having the same feelings as your SO, it had a tendency to make me anxious rather than relaxed, and made conversation that much harder for me, as I was even more paranoid about the words coming out of my mouth and how sluggish my brain felt. That being said, a lot of my friends still smoke, and I don't mind being around it or being around psychedelics, just please don't try to pressure me into doing what I don't want to.
Other people on here might disagree with me, but I have a hard time saying no, and would sooner avoid the people that try to push me against my wishes rather than tell them what's up.
So I guess that's my advice. Keep being affectionate to her and hanging out how you do, just don't be forceful, and appreciate your easygoing communication for what it is, good chemistry is good."
4505,isfp,"Yeah, I guess I had the impression that even the isfps that aren't type 9 still tend to be kinda easily dominated, because they can be quiet, unassertive, go-with-the-flow, and conflict-hating, but I admit I overgeneralyze with mbti and I make connections that may not be valid. I need to meet more ISFPs :p 
And I realized after I posted that I was probably making assumptions that any isfp-enfp relationship would be similar to mine.... but oh well, hopefully there is still something useful in there for someone!"
4506,isfp,That's all great advice and I appreciate it. I'm sure everything will go well then because I don't want to pressure her into anything. She's ok with me smoking weed and I wouldnt want her to touch any psychedelics anyway. 
4507,isfp,"judging from the threads i honestly think i must be one of the bitchiest ISFPs out there
i am pretty honest and don't care too much about people's feelings on occasions but a lot of this is just a shell i've built over the years to survive
if there was anyone i could fully trust (there isn't), i'm really a pretty nice guy"
4508,isfp,"I think a lot of isfps are very sensitive and it's natural to build a shell to protect that soft underbelly.  Maybe one day when you find someone you trust enough to break out of your shell with them, you'll find yourself much less ""bitchy"" ;) not gonna lie, I thought you were an invader from one of the other subreddits because usually the ISFPS around here just pat each other on the back, and it's only when I venture into the other subs that I get called out on posting something that wasn't well thought out. It's scary out there man, the trolls are everywhere. And I think they like messing with me a little extra because I'm a girl or a sensor, but maybe I'm just paranoid :p "
4509,isfp,"wait what did i call out?
haven't trusted anyone that much my whole life, not even family, probably never will. i'm an excellent actor though. i like to pick an MBTI and act like that for a while. I acted as an INTP for about 3 months, it wasn't too fun. i'm fairly good at acting a role as well. if i wanted to be manipulative (i don't, i have a strong moral code and respect people a lot in general), i could be excellent at it. i am a pretty good liar (if i need to to get out of danger- otherwise i am honest) and i can hide my emotions completely. also i'm not really bitchy per se"
4510,isfp,"You called out me assuming all ISFPs were sweet little type 9s like myself :p  I'm not offended, I am all for accuracy around here.  I was only saying ""bitchy"" since you introduced the term and applied it to yourself. 
I think it's interesting that you trust nobody, not even your family, and then you go on to describe your skills at lying, manipulation and deceit, if the situation calls for it. Maybe you assume everybody likes acting and pretending like you do and that's why you don't trust. My first impression was that you were an INTP by your initial comment, and I think it's quite possible that you are now trying to ""act the role"" of an ISFP and you're a much worse actor than you claim. "
4511,isfp,"ik about the bitchy part. there may be a better word
nah, i don't think I'm an INTP
no, this is definitely not why. there is a strong history of emotional / sexual / physical / emotional abuse / substance dependency /  crime in the family going back several generations on both sides, i am just trying to protect myself. i never lie to hurt someone else. i have never hurt someone. and yes the situation does call for it."
4512,isfp,I did a free test and after reading all nine personalities I found out that I am a type 2 (Helper/Giver) along with being an ISFP. If you haven't heard of it you should try it out if you are interested in improving yourself! This is the link to the test if you all are interested http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/dis_sample_36.asp?discover#.Uvov07T9VyU
4513,isfp,"You might also be interested in The Big Five test, if you haven't heard of it already. I don't remember if I've taken it or not but I've heard good things about it. Some say it's more accurate than the MBTI."
4514,isfp,"The Individualist
The Loyalist"
4515,isfp,I'm glad you enjoyed the test. My friend is type 4 and she couldn't believe how correct the test was for her. It has helped her pinpoint the areas where she needs help the most and improve in those trouble areas. 
4516,isfp,"While everyone has all 9 types in them, there is a dominant type within people that have a specific passion driving them through life, it is easy to relate to them all and many books all agree on one thing, ""everyone has a dominant type."".  It took me a long time to find who I really was because usually I'm so worried about others I forgot myself! Glad you like the test and thanks for posting!"
4517,isfp,"I just took the Big five test, I found most of it to be true for me, I must have answered strangely to a few questions pertaining to creativity because it said I was on the more 'uncreative' side. I spend most of my free time drawing, sculpting projects and writing stories. 
But other than that it was spot on! It even stated that I might have a messy desk (which was true) and that my biggest trait was my agreeableness. Thanks for suggesting!"
4518,isfp,"Nice! The only thing I would suggest is that you try to narrow it down to one dominant type (I know it's hard but you must for your own benefit!). You have every type inside you and most books say that one type will be the dominant or primary type. If you don't know how to narrow it down you can watch videos on youtube about the Eneagram, read online profiles or buy a book on it. I got a book and it's truly fascinating to read about all the types and even find yourself buried underneath it all. Knowing more about your weak points and problem areas you might have really helps in life. At least it's helped me!"
4519,isfp,It helped explain why I always seem very feeling-oriented despite testing as an INTP with consistent 100% Ti on sliding scale tests. It also matches up with function - oriented tests I've done that give me 100% Ti and Fi simultaneously since 5w4 catches the logical and the emotional aspects. So yeah it really just helped validate that the feeling aspect was there and was one of the factors in my deciding on Ti-loving ISFP for my mbti type.
4520,isfp,"I feel like you all get down on yourself a lot, so I wanted to spread some love. Here are things I adore about you guys....

You ooze sensuality in the most gentle and unassuming way...makes me want to crawl over for a snuggle 
You are unafraid to be yourself and generally not worried about how others view you 
You hold yourself in a quiet yet confident manner 
You know how to relax and slow down in a crazy fast world 
The way you communicate with your body language and facial expressions is the most beautiful thing 
Your artistic flare for life, however you chose to express it, is inspiring and refreshing 
"
4521,isfp,"Anime watchers of r/isfp, which anime character or characters have you found the most relatable to yourself?
I just realized that I related to Shiny Chariot (both her bad and good traits) from Little Witch Academia the most. (I could see a lot of ISFP qualities in her and I think she's definitely an ISFP.)"
4522,isfp,"Ichinotomi.

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This )^portmanteau ^( was created from the phrase 'Ichinose Kotomi'. To learn more about me, check out this )^FAQ."
4523,isfp,"I, legitfeelz, take you, huskergatebaldursdu, to be my S/O. I will try to be true to you in good times and bad, in sickness and in health. I will try to the best of my ability to love you and honour you all the days of my life. "
4524,isfp,"I do. 
And I'm going to be purchasing 1 acre of land in the utah desert  and building a ""tinyhome"" on it if youre interested. There probably wont be room in the bed but you can sleep in my car outside. If we want to have sex we can just roll around in the dirt outside"
4525,isfp,That sounds very lovely. Count me in. I would rather much prefer to sleep on the ground outside than in the car though. The cold midnight breeze brushing up against my nipple hairs. And hearing crickets sing their lovely tunes. 
4526,isfp,"Good morning, I have been trying to type my wife lately, and I believe that she is an ISFP based on the eight cognitive functions. My only concern is that we have never really done anything artistic. I would like to give her the opportunity to explore that aspect of her personality (perhaps on a date), but I am unsure about the best way to do this. Do you guys have any suggestions? Are any of you lovely people also non-artistic ISFPs. I am an ENFP, so extroverted sensing is my worst cognitive function; so I am very out of my element here. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!
EDIT: I would like to clarify that my wife is an amazing writer and has an awesome blog. So she doesn't lack artistic talent, but I want to give her the chance to use all of her senses in different ways."
4527,isfp,"Hmmmm... how about a coffee art course or crafts workshop? There's no reason why you can't join in and learn some artistic skills of your own.  
idk im just throwing out ideas (ISFPs please chime in if I am off-base)"
4528,isfp,"Maybe take her on a nature walk and then you two can spend some time painting or taking pictures of all that you see, if you think that‚Äôs something she would enjoy.
Also, just because ISFPs are very artistic doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that they are artsy. Sometimes they enjoy art in the form of aesthetics. For me, personally, I‚Äôm pretty awful at art, and it doesn‚Äôt hold my attention very long, but I‚Äôve moved to places that are the most aesthetically pleasing, and I enjoying being surrounded by places that inspire me. So we don‚Äôt always need to get our artistic sides out with art, sometimes we just like being surrounded by beauty. Maybe consider taking to her to a place she would deem aesthetically pleasing.
Best of luck to you! It‚Äôs super cool that you‚Äôre thinking about this aspect of her personality and wanting to take action on it."
4529,isfp,"I like to think of the ISFP trait as creative, not necessarily artistic (in the sense of classic studio art). Your wife‚Äôs writing definitely fits the bill. I personally like some types of creativity but not others. (I‚Äôm not into painting, but I like photo and movie editing.) I also greatly appreciate other people‚Äôs creativity and beautiful things, which I think is our sensing side. Especially from artists who think outside of the box. Also nature. 
My recommendation would be to find out what new creative thing your wife is interested in trying and go in that direction. It could be that she‚Äôs interested in expressing her creativity through dancing, making studio art work, playing a musical instrument, writing poetry, making a movie, making jewelry or something that could be sold on Etsy, or enjoying a really nice day outdoors (etc.)"
4530,isfp,"every post here is just like: isfps push people away, struggle to maintain relationships, struggle to create meaningful relationships, struggle to put thoughts into words, struggle to stand out from a crowd, insecure, socially inept, perceived as boring, struggle to express and feel emotions, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
And I fit into all of these, and my life feels like a total mess"
4531,isfp,"Im ISFP and I feel like Im strong in most of these. In fact, this seems to be so far removed from me its laughable. I have life long relationships with friends since grade school. Most of my ex girlfriends are still part of my life in positive ways. I love formulating words from passion into something I can say to others that may be hurting. Which i would say is our strong suit. Granted im terrible with reading and writing. I've taken 3 mbti tests and all ISFP, so Im not sure how we compare but there is an underlying issue Im sure you are not sharing. I will give you this, i dont require tons of friends, infact 2-3 close ones at any given time fits me well. Within my close group of friends Im far from perceived as boring.
Reason posts here are asking those in depth questions and the glaring ones is because people like to figure out and have resolve instead of sharing positive aspects I suppose. sorry if this came off as arrogant in anyway, but its important to note not everyone is the same just because we fall within the same parameters. It might just be flipping a switch and learning to carry yourself a bit different.   "
4532,isfp,"A single good trait? How about not being dependent on constant human contact? This is perceived as a negative by a lot of extroverts, who think (hope?) that deep inside we are the same attention whores, who are either just better at hiding it or are too inept to even try. I can't put into words how happy I am to not share this suffering, that I constantly see in memes lately. Somebody thinks I'm boring? I'm sorry. Good thing I've got enough people in my life who think otherwise, and even if I wouldn't, I'd still be far from suicidal."
4533,isfp,"I have all of these traits in my nature but they don't define me. I'm also logical, introspective, great at being content with very little and living in the moment. Not everyone likes us, but those who do love us. We're known for our wisdom and ability to see all sides of an issue. We have plenty of strengths. There's a lot to be proud of."
4534,isfp,"Well, we're all at various levels of health and maturity, and many isfps are also enneagram 4 and when that's unhealthy, it can come off as self loathing.  At some point though, it all depends on the cause and effect of your proclivities, like, are you pushing people away out of a fear of intimacy, or are you taking control of who you allow into your life?  A lot of it is just shifting your perspective, for instance, come to listen and learn, not to initiate and express.  And embrace your wierdness.  I promise you, you are standing out from the crowd and while it sucks to feel so constantly misunderstood, you have the power to harness that for good and create something truly moving, and it doesn't have to be for anyone but yourself.  You have it in you.  You just need to give yourself a fighting chance, and if that means a little more introspection, indulge that, indulge it often, because you have the ability to really know who you are from  all angles, and a strong sense of self is a wonderful thing to go through life with. "
4535,isfp,"I'm a 27 year-old ISFP and I'm loving it!! 
I have a stable 8am-5pm day-job that pays okay, and when I'm home, I practice my art (writing)
I guess it sucks that we can't naturally speak out in groups or in public because of low Te and Ne, but thats the only drawback I see.
Can you even imagine having a dominant function other that Fi?? Just thinking about it gives me nightmares. I understand myself well, and act upon my likes and dislikes to the extent that I can, and that keeps my subconscious in place.
And not to mention the Se-Ni axis allowing us to see reality as it is... It's fucking great being an ISFP!!"
4536,isfp,"ISFP are incredibly relaxing. I‚Äôm dating one now and whenever I‚Äôm around him I just mellow out so much, which is super refreshing to my harsh SJ. They are very easy going, go and don‚Äôt often make demands of you. They are also super sensual and utilize touch in the best way to express affection "
4537,isfp,"u/flashtone is right, most of the time people post because they need help on something, either about an ISFP or as an ISFP. I think this is the case for other subreddits as well. There are so many positive traits that ISFPs have and I as an ENFP often wish I were more like you guys - independent, sensitive, effortlessly artistic, funny and interesting. Also, unhealthy people of any type will struggle, just in different ways. Hope you feel better soon!"
4538,isfp,"Dude. We all feel like a total mess. Thats what makes us great. Its really easy to empathize and understand others when you constantly shit can yourself. Its our game. Its my game at the very least anyway.
If I had to put one quality that we all share I wouldn't know what to say. We are ISFP's. We aren't the same person. Shit. I'm a different person based on my mood. I could tell you the best quality about myself and see how that fits into your belief of yourself. I hardly doubt thats what you're looking for but here goes.
My best quality is that if you treat me right and reciprocate my loyalness then I will be never endingly loyal. The funny thing is is that I will be loyal to people I know damn well aren't good people. If you treat me the way I think I deserve to be treated then you will have a friend you can call to help you bury a body."
4539,isfp,"While I am pretty awkward socializing with strangers, I enjoy socializing with my close friends. I am not inept. Just picky. I'm also very expressive & like to stand out from the crowd if the situation is right. I don't anyone would call me boring. I was voted ""most unique"" in middle & high school. And definitely none of things about relationships apply to me personally. I am in a very strong & healthy relationship with an INFP who is my very best friend. I could be wrong (fellow ISFPs can tell me if I am), but I don't think ISFPs are BAD at those things persay. Just bad at them with the wrong people. I can say that I used to think I was bad at relationships. Turns out I just didn't really like the other person as much as I told myself I did. Since meeting my fiance, that has completely changed. We both give our best to the relationship, take care of each other in equal measure, almost never argue, & the entire thing just feels so easy & right.
All introverted types tends to struggle with these things, feelers just tend to notice it more. ISFPs are more likely to have their own little world & pocess more quirky personalities. It's hard to let just anyone into that little world."
4540,isfp,"i used to fit into all of those too, but i think being a healthy version of your type just comes with maturity and growth. i was toxic af when i was younger and now i can look back and recognize it. also (i can't stress this enough) SELF LOVE AND SELF CARE is so important. everyone, and every type, has positive qualities even if they're still growing ‚ô°
i used to hate everything about my type, i mean sensors and feelers (especially fi-users) get made fun of so much by the mbti community. but i love being an isfp. i love being sensitive, spontaneous, artistic, and empathetic. do i wish i could be an ESFJ or ESFP some days? is it difficult to remember my self-worth when im literally surrounded by thinkers? of course. but we are who we are and all we can do is make the best of it."
4541,isfp,"Three separate times ISFPs have figured me out quickly (as someone who uses dominant Fi) shortly after first meeting. When I first meet ISFPs I immediately feel like we are pretty different people, but there is this way ISFPs look at me that's almost like fishing for Fi, or that they somehow know what kind of person I am and are trying to get the Fi out of me. And that's really cool actually, because it makes me feel comfortable using Fi with them from the start. Once I realize they are also Fi users everything changes for both of us.
Once I get past this strangely quick initiation phase where we both subconsciously acknowledge we are Fi doms, the friendship is basically set. As an INFP I don't even need to talk to other Fi users to feel the connection, and I'm pretty sure other IxFPs and maybe even all Fi users have a similar thing. 
So yeah in short, ISFPs seem really good at figuring out what kind of person I am and then getting it out of me. They just know I'm an INFP somehow. And once they do we become friends really quickly. 
NOW I have a question for ISFPs: Are you aware of when you do this with INFPs? Before you learned about MBTI did you sense something like that happening?"
4542,isfp,"Personally, I don't know and may have never known another IxFP in my life and so I can't directly answer whether or not I'm aware of when I do this with other INFPs. However, whether someone is introverted or extroverted plays an important role on how I interact with someone and how I determine whether or not we will get along. I feel more at ease with introverts. With extroverts, I feel like I constantly have to ""be on"". I like both groups, but it's easier to adjust my behavior to get along with them after I've identified which category they fall under. I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing this is why others might be fishing for Fi in you when you first meet. "
4543,isfp,"Well, I hope you don't take this as creepy but INFPs feel a particular connection with you when you're around, like there's an invisible line connecting the two. And whenever I talk or laugh with an IxFP it's too real."
4544,isfp,"As a fellow ISFP, I've had a lot of issues with college. I'm 25 now and am back in school after flailing around and failing out the first time. I'm somebody that if I am not passionate about something, I find it hard to put my time and effort into it. However, let me say that not finishing school was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. I'm now working full time, going to school full time, and taking out loans to pay for a degree that I feel that I need. However, this time it is on my own time and is my own decision. I am also following my passions where I can go to school and use my hands as well as my mind. I found a school that caters to exa
Nowadays, college is almost a necessity just to put you on equal ground with the majority of your peers. It is a bit sad, actually, especially considering college is made more for a different kind of person than we are. However, if you find something you love, I'm sure it would be an exceptional experience for you. I'm actually loving being back in school right now, even though it is hard work."
4545,isfp,"College is just the next step for a lot of people. I don't think its necessary for everyone to go though. For me personally it's been good because I am not very self motivated when it comes to academia, but I am highly motivated by grades. So, the grade motivation has helped me in learning. On my own I would have never have taken the initiative to learn what I have. "
4546,isfp,"For an ISFP on the fence about college, I would say that if you have a solid idea of your major and if you have the financial means, go for it. If you're not sure, or if you are being pressured by family, don't go. Take a few years, get a job. Go to college when (or if) you find the thing you want to do with your life, and whether or not you need the degree to do it. Because going to school just for the sake of having that piece of paper doesn't really work for people like us. Overall it was useful for me, but there were definitely some things I had to do that were useless bullshit, and if I didn't have a larger goal in mind I would have lost myself there. I got a degree in music, and though many have told me that I wasted my money on a worthless degree, any other major would have sucked out my soul. Now I'm in grad school, because a masters is kind of required to get anywhere in music nowadays. I'm definitely terrified of the loans and how I'm going to live. But I don't think I will ever regret the experience college gave me and the opportunities in a field that I love. "
4547,isfp,"I loved the social aspect of college, I met a lot of awesome new people. Although I do love the challenge of school, it really started to get tiresome studying for classes I didn't really care about. For instance, I love studying for classes that I think are interesting, but studying for classes that bore me.. I just don't see the point. Mathematics for example, I don't see the point in it, because I know personally I'm not going to be using pre-cal in my life, so why study it? Some people may enjoy it and find meaning in it, but I don't. I love history, psychological, and geography classes, though. 
So yup, college was a great experience for me, the people I met, the memories.. great times. But going to class was a challenge some of the time. "
4548,isfp,"i went to college by default. middle class background, ""college prep"" high school. i did not have the presence of mind to figure out how to make it work for me, so what i got out of it was what fell in my lap. which is to say a handful of good friends, a connection that resulted in the job i've had for the past five years, and no real clue about what i really enjoyed in life until after i graduated and finally began exploring things at my own behest.
i guess it all boils down to perspective, which can be changed. some days, i wish i could do it all over again differently. other days, i feel renewed purpose as i realize i am where i am because of my decisions so far, and i can be elsewhere if i choose to be. "
4549,isfp,"This is my view towards post high school education.
I am a 17 year old high school student. I will probably drop out after 11th and take my GED, but I do want to eventually go to college to become a professional chef. I'm looking for jobs in my area in the food service industry so I can get experience and get a bit of a feel for what working in the food industry is like.
Before I decided to set a goal of becoming a chef I was going to go to a 4 year program for Psychology, become a therapist and eventually get my Ph.D. Unfortunately, while I like studying psych, I'm not sure if I have the patience or dedication to spend the next 10-12 years of my life only working towards a Ph.D. There's places I want to go and things I want to see before I'm a bitter old man who stays indoors all day because I've read too many books and still can't come to terms with dysfunctionality of my relationships and the fate of humankind as a whole (Or maybe I'm just cynical).
Cooking, on the other hand, cooking is my thing. I've been working in the kitchen since I was 12. I love trying new recipes, mastering old timeless ones, making my own and just enjoying food preparation as an art form. Plus, Culinary schools take 2 years or less to complete. That's something I can handle.
TL;DR 4 year Master's in Psych? Nope. 2 year degree in culinary arts? Sure."
4550,isfp,"You get out of it what you put into it. I learned a lot because I went to all of my classes and put my best effort into most of them.   
I majored in Computer Science, so I got a job fairly easily.   
Being happy has nothing to do with college. Happiness is a state of mind. Try not to link it with material things like what you own, or where you feel like you are in life. It's all in your outlook.   
College is great! Definitely one of the best experiences of my life. About 5 years out I still keep in contact with a hand full of my friends (I moved away from my college area for work, so I can't see them as often as I'd like). Lots of experiences that you just can't get if you go straight into the workforce from highschool. I wouldn't trade it for the world."
4551,isfp,"I quit my job as a waitress a couple months ago, and I‚Äôve started to feel pretty guilty and lazy about it lately. Even focusing on selling art and creating music, I know that won‚Äôt give me a steady income. I‚Äôm about to start going back to school later this year, and I‚Äôd like a job before then to get back on my feet.
So far, I‚Äôve worked mostly in the food business with a couple off-to-the-side gigs. Working in those environments really seem to stress me out and put me in a low depression slump. With my last job (especially as bad as the work environment was), I developed a pretty severe drinking problem up until I put in my 2 weeks.
Are there any good jobs that don‚Äôt require a bachelor‚Äôs or higher education (besides diploma/GED, of course) that ISFPs would enjoy? Or, I should say, a job that doesn‚Äôt constantly drain and depress them? I‚Äôve thought about working at an animal shelter, but I‚Äôm not quite sure yet on what kind of job I‚Äôm looking for."
4552,isfp,"I literally just got a job at a local wildlife park - family run so a nice close workforce, and just a beautiful park full of animals and whatever. It‚Äôs perfect. A good summer job, but optional to even stay on afterwards.
Obviously it‚Äôs kinda limited to where you are, but pretty much any similar job would be ideal for an ISFP I think. Relaxed, and filled with nature. Would also be very open to your age. Good luck!"
4553,isfp,"perhaps some kind of interior design? or website design? or landscaping?
I've enjoyed doing things like finishing carpentry and other trades that I can keep my hands and mind busy and put out quality work.  Also I used to do pizza delivery, easy job and kinda fun/not very stressful... no one is mad at you when pizza shows up"
4554,isfp,I like washing dishes. It does suck somewhat but it's peacefull and the place i work is small with a nice boss which makes all the difference. I've been a server too and this is a food service job that's way wayyyy better than waiting tables. Super low stress and away from the action. Plus it pays more than minimum wage.
4555,isfp,"design seems cool, it's something I'm working towards doing myself. I would like to do it long term possibly, I know a few people who do but also know some who do it on the side. I can't see myself doing anything that's not creative as a long term career
I work in security now and it's really easy, just depends what post you manage to get. it's very boring at times(especially if you work at night) but as long as your schedule is good then it's not too stressful. I was doing graveyard and swing shifts in the same week for about 2 months(just stopped this week actually) and it sucked, because my sleep schedule was all over the place. the pay at my place is also a bit over min. wage, but it varies by job
Also I used to work at a clothing store, it was pretty fun but a lot of work. not really stressful, but talking to people all day and trying to sell stuff was a little annoying after a while "
4556,isfp,"Well it's extroverted sensation so its wanting to go out into the world and experience things, touch things, be totally present in whatever is going on around you. Coupled with the Fi it can help us refine who we are, what matters to us, who we care about, etc. If you avoid it and rely on Ni too much (lock yourself away from the world), you can end up being paranoid, telling yourself stories that don't reflect reality, etc."
4557,isfp,"It makes me very conscious of the cleanliness of my home. Some clutter is fine, but actual mess like a dirty kitchen will make me stressed and depressed very quickly. Luckily that also means a clean and nice smelling home will lift me up easier than pretty much anything. "
4558,isfp,"I find this to be more the case for me. I'm currently torn between INTJ, INFP and ISFP, more so the first and last. I don't tend to notice myself using Ni a whole lot, and definitely not Te, at least not enough for it to be my auxiliary. Growing up I was constantly drawing, painting, reading, writing, and exploring the woods around my house. I would go outside in the morning, usually barefoot, and stay out all day. Nowadays, I don't use Se as much, but I want to be more active, I enjoy hiking, want to go camping more, ect. I'm incredibly torn between these few types because of the massive amounts of trauma I've been through; I can't discern between my true nature and behaviors I had to learn to survive and cope with what was going on around me. I lack the planning ability that most INTJs seem to have, but I really resent the idea of having a Feeling function so high in my function stack, but I was always a painfully sensitive child, and was taught from a young age that emotion makes you weak, all that crap. Typing can be extremely confusing...."
4559,isfp,"^^I second this. I‚Äôm unfortunately EXTREMELY messy naturally, but if my environment is clean, looks nice, smells nice, etc. I am way better at properly dealing with any stress or conflict going on in my life."
4560,isfp,"I've been close with a number of ISFPs, in fact my mother is one, and they used to be my least favorite type to be around as an INTP... always too touchy and sensitive about their values, with weird aversions to things and preferences with a knack for showing disgust at ridiculous things. Kind of critical, and they're old opinions anyways.
But then I realized that some of the ISFPs in my life were the exact opposite- okay with anything that few other people would be okay with. Accepting of their environment and capable of putting up with things that I would never put up with. Some ISFPs I know have been totally cool with unfaithful partners as well, and my ISFP roommate can just let things go, whatever they are. 
Did any of you have an 'aha!' moment were you transformed into this? What happened to cause it? Thank you for your replies!"
4561,isfp,"When I was younger, I used to get angry a lot. I mean fight people and punch people till they bled kind of angry. I came from a broken home that I'd rather not get into, but I started out feeling everything and everything was a personal threat. So I got in trouble a lot and I felt bad for hurting the people I love. After awhile I moved from my mother's house to my dad's house, and that made a world of difference. Not because I felt my emotions less at the time, but my dad was just better at funneling them productively.  I changed from an angry person and I haven't been angry at anyone (or anything really) in 6 years. Sometimes I don't even know if I can get angry and I don't know why. I do my best not to hurt people or anything really, became a vegetarian, and I'm a pacifist now too. Idk those just seemed like the right things to do for me.
Generally, tho, when I feel like something is going wrong, I cloister up and think the fuck out of the issue. I usually come out of my cloister with new found beliefs or motivations or a new point of view. For example, if I feel depressed, I will go into my room and lay in bed for a couple hours or more a day and just think about it and feel it. Usually I come out of my seclusion and have a better outlook on what happiness is to me and what I can do to make me happy, then I do it. I don't mean to make it sound simple, because it isn't, but that's what I do and I do my best transformations on my own through personal examinations of my feelings, and it's something people will notice but never see me do. Hope that helps!"
4562,isfp,"I spent my childhood focused on justice and fairness. Came from a church upbringing as well. Prided myself on being loving and selfless and empathetic, but would lose my mind when I felt like others weren't the same and weren't being punished like I was any time I would falter. That took me into my twenties and it wasn't until I realized that I needed to just appreciate that I cared about those things and ACTUALLY have empathy for others, especially unlike me, that I started to let those things go. I love other people so much and I often put them before myself and that can lead to bitterness and pain. Now I try to be as honest with myself as I used to be with them and always focus on intentions over actions. My sensitivity is part of my patience for others now as opposed to complaining and over analyzing. ""The Four Agreements"" really opened my eyes to most of this. Honestly saved my life. "
4563,isfp,"As an ISFP i totally agree with this.
Just throwing this out there... It seems to me that when I was younger I felt a lot of emotions but did not know how to process them in a mature way and so reacting with anger was always easier.
I think as I grew up I got better at thinking things through and exploring my other feelings about what is affecting or upsetting me. "
4564,isfp,"When I was younger, I used to be waaay oversensitive. I'd start crying at any little thing: being teased, getting in trouble, etc. By the time I hit puberty, I'd mostly learned to control it. I would still cry in inconvenient situations and I HATED it, but I couldn't stop. In high school, I was very depressed and went to the extreme of hiding all my feelings until senior year when I finally started opening up. I realized the danger of keeping it all to myself and I started being okay with certain people seeing me cry (close friends and family). The funny thing is: ever since I became ok with crying in front of people, I find that I can now control my tears in most situations that used to make me break down."
4565,isfp,"When I was young, I was quite sensitive and prideful and also easily hurt. But as I grow older, I became emo and have a low self esteem and still as easily hurt. Now as an adult, I have learnt to be more logical, to put on a cheerful face when needed and my self esteem issues are getting better and yet I still get easily hurt. I reveal my true self too easily to people when prodded and  it gives me serious emotional attachment to people who gives me attention and some slight caring. But I've grown more accepting of things and also differences. It is really what you encountered in life that changes you. "
4566,isfp,"I also used to be an extremely angry person because I always felt like people were out to get me or that I  was being restrained/put in a box.
I don't recall what triggered my transformation but I just had enough of being angry. Maybe I just grew up and matured. Maybe my attitude changed and I subconsciously realized it wasn't worth getting worked up over small stuff. (I always realized that consciously but could never convince my subconscious.)
Now I can only think of three times I've been angry in the last seven years or so. All for perfectly legitimate reasons.
I find it fascinating because I've heard this quite a few times on this subreddit. I don't typically think of ISFPs as hotheaded or angry, but it actually seems pretty common, but it seems equally common to grow out of it.
Edit: To OP...
Going with what I said above, it may have had something to do with being so into my values. I think I've always been an accepting person, but I think part of it may be better understanding people with different values and their motives better. Instead of feeling attacked that they don't respect my values, I think I put myself in other people's shoes more now, also leading me to put up with things I sometimes shouldn't."
4567,isfp,"I saw someone call someone an entitled bitch, and it made me wonder what I am entitled to. The more I think about the term ""entitled bitch"" The more it makes me wonder if that is even an insult. Honestly. I am an entitled bitch. I'm the only one entitled to my time and how I choose to spend it. No matter how sound your argument is I am entitled to my own thoughts even if they are factually incorrect. I do believe I am entitled to at least two feet of personal space whenever possible. If my door is closed I am entitled to a knock. At work I am entitled to a little wiggle room. I work for you, but I am not your bitch. Don't get it twisted. You have no right to my inner thoughts. You have no right to my kindness. You have no right to my respect. I care very little about what other people think. Honestly. I am an entitled bitch.
Is this just me? Are there any other entitled bitches in this sub? Is this an ISxP thing?"
4568,isfp,"YES. So many times YES. I can‚Äôt tell you how many Fe doms I used to piss off just by existing in their school or workplace.
They act like you‚Äôre obligated to talk to them or respect them or put on some display of friendliness or engage in pointless formalities or be receptive to their intrusiveness ‚Äújust because.‚Äù
And if you don‚Äôt notice (or care about, if we‚Äôre being  completely honest) their passive aggressive tries at guilt tripping or shaming you into assimilating, then they began to view you as ‚Äúthe enemy‚Äù and they start in with the direct verbal attacks and attempt to recruit others into hating you too.
You can‚Äôt win their game, for real. I just ignore them altogether if possible."
4569,isfp,I know. Guilt tripping is completely fucking wasted on me. It only works if I was the direct cause of what happened. Usually you don't even have to guilt trip me either. I'll beat myself up for you. I'll apologize until you want to hit me.
4570,isfp,I know. The more I fucking think about it the stupider it sounds to me. What the fuck is it supposed to mean? It sounds accurate. Not insulting. Honestly. If you aren't an entitled bitch. Then you're just a wimp. Fight me.
4571,isfp,"Also, I think you are misunderstanding the word entitled. The things you quote would only be violated by an entitled person's behaviour. It does not make you entitled to demand these for yourself. Entitled = 'believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment',  which is exactly what people not respecting your time, thoughts, opinions etc. are. Peace ‚ô•Ô∏è"
4572,isfp,"Same. I grew up with an ENFJ mom so I‚Äôve been immune to guilt trips for as long as I can remember. I don‚Äôt even like commercials or reality television or news stories that attempt to manipulate emotions because it‚Äôs so insultingly obvious to me.
But man, yeah. If I do something fucked up and it hurts somebody I will never forgive myself. To this day I lie awake at night sometimes, beating myself up about shitty things I said or did in high school (and that was a long time ago.)"
4573,isfp,"True we have strong beliefs, like for me I researched a lot about vaccines and am against it, all my friends are like you are incorrect and Im like, you didnt see what i see. I worked with people with autism and have talked with parents. They think im a danger because i keep telling others about the dangers. I will defend my beliefs  and if you think im crazy or wrong, whatever floats your boat man, just dont get your panties tied or try to convince me otherwise cuz ive done my research."
4574,isfp,"Had to read that like four times. I think you're right. I am misusing the word entitled here. But I will stand fast that no one is entitled to my respect. At the very least they are entitled to not being disrespected. Though I think me saying that is just splitting hairs. I can see where my head was earlier when I posted it, but I do think I was using the word entitled incorrectly."
4575,isfp,I wish I had spent more time with my Dad before he passed on. Funny to think how that 30 minute drive barred me from visiting more often. I dunno. I just thought I had more time. Didn't expect to wake up one morning and him just be fucking dead. AJSDFIFJERSERKS::KAK:DA:

I lasted six months because I wasn't 'communicating enough' and forgot new instructions that had to be explained to me repeatedly. I was good at the work but not at being 'warm' or rousing enough according my boss, even though my work was faultless. Has any other ISFP managers encountered problems? I feel like I have ADD and my confidence is gone :( The stress has been debilitating. My colleagues were both ENFJs and bullied me. Any similar experiences welcome x"
4577,isfp,"I'm sorry that this happened to you, but you are a braver person than me for taking on that role. I'm an ISFP and can never imagine myself in a leadership position. I know that's not very feminist of me, but I just feel more comfortable in the background and taking someone else's instructions. I care too much about being diplomatic and being liked. Anyway, it sounds like you are better off without your bully coworkers...hoping for better things for you in your future! Better that you tried than never did anything at all."
4578,isfp,"Sorry to hear. It seems they fired you for very materialistic reasons. Find an experience that values you for the actual work you do, not for how 'presentable' you appear. Taking a position of authority doesn't come naturally to me. I did a job which was voluntary at my local football team, being the assistant in the club shop. I couldn't deal with an opposition fan making a gesture at me through the window, and having to answer questions from people. Thankfully the guy who ran the club shop was understanding when I said I didn't want to do it anymore."
4579,isfp,"Thank you PhoneJazz, that means a lot. I knew that I shouldn't have taken on the job, but I've been walked over so much in my life, I wanted to prove myself. Now I'm just depleted and raw :/ I did that - tried to be diplomatic and nice and I thought ENFJs were supposed to be nice but then I read that they're the type most likely to snitch in work. My deputy complained about me reading the news - I'm a journalist!! They were so insidious and unpleasant. I feel like post-traumatic stress disorder is creeping up. And as for being a feminist... Women are horrible to work with :| I thought I was a laidback feminist, but I now want to work with men again because they are less likely to be so mean and sh*tty. However, I'm still glad that I'm ISFP because we are nice people and mean no harm (when not unhealthy that is :)) Hug to you :) x"
4580,isfp,"Hi republicoftapeworms. It hurts but I'm trying to force my logical side to reason away things. It is a money-making business and not an editorial-led magazine, so they are obviously going to be ruthless. I just hate the feeling of appearing weak and an easy target for bullying :( I'm glad your club boss was nice, it's so difficult to find empathetic employers who are genuine. Hug for you :) xx"
4581,isfp,"I have a group of close friends (most of them are INxx's) at my school whom I dearly love, and wouldn't change them for anything, but I have to admit that over time they've become kind of exhausting to me and feel like they're holding me back from my life overall. This is often the case with many of my relationships (my siblings being almost the only exception), I get along with them super well, have fun and then get pulled into a long term thing where things happen and it becomes complicated and takes a lot of time to solve, and there's never enough time for just enjoying things in the moment. I just wish my friendships were... simpler. At least a bit. At least right now.
I don't even know why I keep attracting these kind of relationships, I just like the people I guess. But ultimately, I feel like my life goal at this point is to (hopefully) find a somewhat remote residence with beautiful surroundings where I can find peace and and some time to myself, and to act somewhat like a 'lone wanderer': doing freelance work maybe, creating artworks in places, helping people, doing my craft projects, being overall free-spirited etc. This would be the ideal life in my vision.
TL;DR I hate being tied down in my relationships. 
I guess this isn't really a DAE, as I don't know whether other ISFPs relate, nor do I think it matters if they (you guys) do. I think everyone here may want different things from their lives. Anyways I just wanted to vent a little, thanks for reading"
4582,isfp,"I‚Äôm and INFJ with an isfp roommate and best friend, and her and I are similar to you in this. I can say the reason I‚Äôm attracted to her personality is because of her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna do me‚Äù attitude; she makes me want to be stronger and more independent, and she‚Äôs the best listener I have ever had in a friend. 
I will tell you though, if you just let your friends know you prefer the freedom of doing things randomly over planning time together, they will be okay with it. I‚Äôm not sure how old you are, but I remember living with my family and feeling like I just wanted to be on my own, but when I got it I hated it. I would fall into a depressive state of loneliness. There‚Äôs always a balance, and you need to do what‚Äôs best for you so in turn you can be a good friend. 
I‚Äôm not sure if this is what you were looking for, but hopefully it makes sense. "
4583,isfp,"The problem is mostly with me wanting to engage in reality and do different stuff all the time and wanting to move between different places. They mostly want to stay in the same place talking about ideas in great detail. Maybe I'm just not compatible with them as friends, I don't want to stay in the same place doing the same thing all the time, haha.
Like, I didn't mean they restrict freedom because they're INxx's, it's just that it happens to be so for me as a result because I'm kind of different from them and I'm not as enthusiastic about talking about ideas and they want to stay doing that ALL the time. (And I would feel bad if I constantly controlled the flow of things in our group.) Like, for me that is a bit exhausting, I still like them as people though and do enjoy being around them in some part. (By the way, there's an ESTJ in our group who is also interested in ideas and debating and is invested in those discussions every time, so it's not because of me being a sensor)."
4584,isfp,"That's a lot to list, I'll keep it short:


Aggressive douchebags (like the ESTP stereotype, I've encountered some irl) 


In general people who I clash with based on interests and views. People who hate anime and games generally aren't exactly my friends.


Ugliness in general. 


Being trapped by things like projects, exams, etc. Too much stress. 


Socially awkward situations. 


Spiders.


People who are too selfless and people who are too selfish. The former is rather unrelatable and very annoying, while the latter tends to be kinda psychopathic.

4585,isfp,"ISFP-Fi - The feeling subtype usually makes an impression of a modest, gentle, soft person, but in his soul he is very principled, demanding, and distrustful. It is difficult to make him change his mind. Can be very stubborn and intractable. Sensitive, prudish, dislikes imposing his company. Internally highly critical and applies his high ethical standards to other people, though may not openly voice this. If his principles are touched, he can suddenly show his character, becoming sharp and uncompromising. Hardworking and practical. - Full description
ISFP-Se - The sensory subtype is quite strict, critical, and ironic. Categorical in conclusions and uncompromising in decisions. Internally sensitive and emotional, but tries to appear as strong, cold, self-assured person. Serious, guarded, and private. Conservative in his tastes and habits. Diligent in work, though sometimes he lacks in attention and perseverance to complete his assignments. At times seems unapproachable, arrogant, and prickly. His gaze is piercing. His face sometimes assumes a guarded expression. - Full description"
4586,isfp,"I'm pretty sure it's actually specifying ISFJ's by accident, unless the extra socionics part changes everyone's personality type.
There's more at http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEI_subtypes, but here's the 'appearance' of ISFP:
Sensory-Dominant
Appearance
Calm and soft person in interaction. With his presence often pacifies others. Industrious, practical, does everything with a sense of taste. Often engages in fine arts as a hobby. Well-wishing, tactful, unobtrusive. Tries to sympathize, to assist, to provide advice. Loves rest and comfort. Likes talking about his perceptions and sensations. Attentively questions his conversation partner in regard to his or her affairs. Slightly delayed in his behavior and speech, sometimes stretching out words and with difficulty forming clear thoughts. Even if he speaks fast, he doesn't hurry to end the conversation. Able to speak about the same subject with erudition, comprehensively and at great length. Smiles with confidence, nods her or his head as a sign of support. Movements are smooth, stylish, somewhat slow; may appear to waddle and ""walk like a duck"". Undemonstrative, but clothes and accessories nevertheless attract attention.
Ethical/Feeling-Dominant
Appearance
Seems lively, friendly, and unrestrained in conversation; emotionally responsive, easily gives compliments and closes the distance, may even take his conversation partner by his hand; his lack of restraint carries a shade of familiarity. Shyness can alternate with joking remarks; ironic quips easily turn into respectful and serious tone. Often jokes and tells even unpleasant things with a smile as to not offend the other person. Precautionary and careful. From time to time his temper flares up, but he is quickly appeased and is forgiving. Usually optimistic, merry, and upbeat. Likes to give and receive pleasure. Often gives compliments to people and renders various services. Knows how to cheer up or encourage someone. Seems carefree, for he is prone to hide his negative emotions from others. Impatient and restless. Speaks quickly and confidently, with imperative, declaring intonations. Has a quickly moving gaze that notes everything, sometimes cursorily ""shooting"" side to side, other times deep and meaningful. His movements are assured and graceful but a bit gusty."
4587,isfp,"It's not specifying ISFj by accident. You seem to misunderstand that socionics does not assign j/p letters in the same way that MBTI does it, thus ISFj is not same type as ISFJ. The ISFj is a Fi+Se type in socionics that matches MBTI's ISFP that is also a Fi+Se type. Since socionics doesn't assign j/p letter the same way MBTI does it, the j/p is flipped around for introverted types and is written in lower case to show this difference. You can read more about it here: 4-letter type codes in Socionics and MBTI.    
The subtypes that you reposted are for MBTI's ISFJ. See how that page specifies Fe and Si as the leading functions of that type - http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEI_subtypes <- this is MBTI's ISFJ and not ISFP."
4588,isfp,"This isn't ISFp subtypes if you checked the links.   
These are ISFj subtypes. ISFj is their Fi+Se type same as MBTI ISFP. This is why the subtype descriptions are listing Fi and Se as primary functions."
4589,isfp,"I definitely don't know all about socionics! I meant pretty sure as in, according to the socionics page this is not isfp, so I was assuming it wouldn't have such a fundamental divergence, but thank you for explaining! :)"
4590,isfp,"Im trying to numb out and destroy my feelings for a crush. Its one sided and I just want it to disappear quickly. Its bothersome to feel I want to be with this person, but its not possible, she has a boyfriend."
4591,isfp,"Just cut all contact. Like, delete numbers etc. I know it might be hard depending on circumstances but it really is the best way. Same with breakups. Other than that there really isn‚Äôt much more? Idk, sorry I can‚Äôt really help. Sounds like a bad situation :/"
4592,isfp,"Get as far away as humanly possible. Remove anything within your circle that can remind you that the crush even exists. From one ISFP to another, that‚Äôs the only way. Speaking from experience. üòî That‚Äôs the only thing that helped."
4593,isfp,"i experienced this during college days 
got a fuckin crush on my classmate it really hits me hard every day 
to the point that when i suddenly remeber her out of nowhere i‚Äôll just  fuckin‚Äôsmile  even when im alone 
she is my block mate, she is my groupmate, and she is my classmate, we‚Äôve been penpals after school but all hell breaks loose when one day we talk and make her confess who is her crush......
i have a feeling thats its mutual, i have  a gut, because of the eye contacts, the smiles, but like all story theres no happy ending 
the one she likes and had a crushed on is the guy next to me , our seating arrangment was alphabetically starting on surnames  mine starts with  B and the guy too.
i moved on like i keep my space and distance and rival with her when it comes to academics and learn to accept things they are........to the point when one day i woke up and my feeling is gone..."
4594,isfp,"Is this what you all do??? I always hear about an isfp who served to be interested or friendly one day then go completely cold for no reason. I do the attitude change thing, but only because I don't want to lead anybody on. Do you all really have to distance yourselves to get over a crush?"
4595,isfp,"Can you go to another church or at a different time? Otherwise yeah as above but just avoid contact whenever possible, choose to talk to other people instead of her etc. Focus on any negative things about her you can think of. Don‚Äôt be rude but. It‚Äôs never easy."
4596,isfp,"I don‚Äôt know about other ISFPs, but it‚Äôs the only thing I can do. When I have a crush, I get swallowed alive by it, and I can‚Äôt just forget and move on when seeing that person all the time. A complete ‚Äúdoor slam‚Äù is the only way I can get my bearings again and reclaim control."
4597,isfp,"I second the negative thoughts about her but almost in a different way. Try actively listing as many good things as you can about other people. When you really look, you‚Äôll realise how good others are and that you don‚Äôt need this crush you can‚Äôt get."
4598,isfp,"This is originally from another MBTI forum. This test is meant to tell the difference in ways the N types and S types perceive the world. 

Look at the picture.
Casually and promptly describe how you perceive the picture. What you notice, what you think, what you feel, etc. Freely.
Let us know your type if you are not ISFP.

Edit: Instead of typing myself, I'll just post a link to the same question I asked in r/infp! Thanks for participating all!"
4599,isfp,"Grey. Fisheye. Decent composition, really, but boring none the less. It's a touristy shot by some-one who is not a total noob at photography. Pretty uninteresting for anyone but the photographer, to remember the trip by. 
Now, what was I supposed to think? :-D "
4600,isfp,"I see the Eiffel Tower, from the bottom. The weather is slightly ominous to me, or maybe that's just the grayish sky. Some tourists of all ages walking around. Must be pretty cold considering most, if not all are wearing pea coats or jackets. A lot of couples roaming around and parents with their kids. I see a man helping out this old woman. Looks like it's gonna rain soon and people want a quick look at the tower before it does. "
4601,isfp,"Obviously the eiffel tower stands out. Makes me think of France and how I heard that they're jerks. Also, the clutter of people reminds me of my plans to be alone when I get out of work. Now I feel excited. Also, that red shirt is pretty bold. 
Sincerely, an intp "
4602,isfp,"There is no ""supposed"" way to perceive anything, but you seem like a typical Sensing individual. 
INtuitive individuals say things like, 
""People look desolate in the bleak weather. The tower is imposing upon them with phallic arrogance."" (real quote from the forum)
""A giant penis, soaks people in and shoots them into the air like a load."" (real quote from r/infp)
""I see the tower far before everything else. Dark, powerful, desolate, perhaps even brutal. Complex upon closer inspection, yet with an absolutely singular raison d'etre. An immovable tyranny over both nature and man that yet finds worship. There is no hope but to either stand in awe or bow your head. Oddly, I do not associate this picture with romance at all. The tower seems devoid of all humanity to me. My main feeling is helplessness to fight some sort of system. The structures and instututions of society, perhaps? That which was once human, but is now devoid of emotion."" (real quote from r/infp)
My impressions: ""Oh. I see a giant arch. Metal. Elaborate patterns. Wait, it's the Tower. Weird angle. A guy with a backpack. Neatly trimmed trees far ahead. Far-away buildings covered in fog. Fog? Smog?""
Pretty Sensing, ain't I? :P"

4604,isfp,"For me, I can‚Äôt help but feel friction with this type. I‚Äôm drawn to them and feel repelled by the, A‚Äôs well, as though I can‚Äôt completely be myself around them. I‚Äôm more subdued and there are way more awkward  moments with them. As though I feel judged by them, maybe because they exacerbate our weakness (extroverted thinking). Any thoughts?"
4605,isfp,"(I'm an ISFP) I Dated one (INTJ) for around 8 months, absolutely loved being with them.
A couple things that stuck out to me about them were...
- Very academically focused, to the point where that's why the relationship ended as they just didn't have the time to worry about me and academics.
- Emotions were a bit tricky. When the situation was one where people would be sad/upset, they seemed to remain neutral. Generally was very kind, happy, and loving.
- Their mind, holy shit, I've never met anyone with as interesting of a mind as them, and doubt I ever will. They had millions of complex things buzzing through their head constantly. It just blows me away, especially compared to my mind where it seems rather blank most of the time. (Random thoughts appear every now and then, but it's generally pretty quiet up there. I do know there's a lot going on behind closed doors though.)
I can say I definitely felt inferior to them at times, but that also pushed me to improve myself more (since I'm fairly competitive)."
4606,isfp,"I‚Äôve had mostly positive experiences with INTJs tbh. They can be a little intimidating, but overall I can appreciate their thinking style even though it‚Äôs very different from my own. It probably helps that I have multiple friends/family members that are INTJs so I‚Äôve spent quite a bit of time around that type. I‚Äôve had the most awkward encounters with INTPs"
4607,isfp,I'm dating one. In general I appreciate the dry humor and hard logic Intjs exhibit. I've always been drawn to this type of person. I appreciate the structure and stability. Something that I struggle with and have not had great examples of growing up. 
4608,isfp,"I‚Äôm a bit late to this thread, but oh well!
I‚Äôm an ISFP and I‚Äôve dated an INTJ, he was my first boyfriend. He was great at the beginning, very witty, funny and confident. But I realised after a few months that he didn‚Äôt really think about my feelings. 
Because I was scared of conflict, and I didn‚Äôt know any better, I would pretty much do anything he asked. He would take advantage of that by making me do things I clearly didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with. 
I think the problem with ISFPs dating INTJs is that they won‚Äôt be able to provide the emotional support that the ISFP needs. My ex found it hard to tell when I was in a bad mood, and would often just ignore it unless I said something. Two introverted feelers in a relationship is hard! 
Peace ‚úåÔ∏è"
4609,isfp,"My dad's an INTJ. If we ever have a conversation, it always seems like we're having two completely different conversations about the same thing. I guess that's what happens when you're almost the polar opposite of each other.
He often likes to give me incredibly detailed travel advice that I cannot possibly parse. I can feel his exasperation in my soul when I say, 'I'll just wing it lOL.'
Nowadays we get along okay I suppose, but we didn't much when I was a teenager."
4610,isfp,"The INTJ I know is really sweet and cares for her friends a lot. She is most definitely not mistyped, but she Fi loops a lot. Sometimes she can be too critical of people and I just listen to her bitch about them. Can't do anything about it because that's her, but I really like that when I tell her something about herself that she needs to work on she really listens and is not stuck up about it."
4611,isfp,I would agree that I feel inferior to then but in a way it aggravates me. I don't think theyre obnoxious but I wish they met me in the middle more often. It seems they are very self interest focused so sometimes I can see they have vastly different values than I do. 
4612,isfp,"To butt in just a little, hopefully you don't mind. I (F, INTJ) don't really understand my husband's (ISFP) moods.
There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to them and he doesn't usually want my advice to fix what seems to me to be the problem, which is the major way that I offer support. 
So ultimately, I tend to ignore, figuring he'll sort it out, unless he starts getting super aggravated about, whatever. This is annoying because I will have offered possible solutions to try, he won't try any of them, then he complains about everything that's jacked up. Wait, what??
At times he says he's just frustrated about a thing and not in a bad mood at all, that he'll be fine in a bit. But I don't understand his process so I leave him to it.
So what I'm getting at is maybe your ex was offering you support in other ways and didn't necessarily understand your moods then would default to a way that he'd handle the thing. 
Just some thoughts as I peruse this lovely subreddit you guys have here in my quest to further understand what goes on in my husband's head. As you were!
Edit* I meant ISFP."
4613,isfp,"They were just way too overloaded by college and will continue to be for a few years, and that combined with semi-long-distance, they didn't have the time/energy for another person. Had it not been for that, I'm sure we'd still be going strong."
4614,isfp,"Something you can try before offering advice is to make your husband feel understood. Accept the aggravation and frustration he feels and validate his feelings. That way he can accept his reaction and move on to think logically about how to handle the problem. I find that if I don‚Äôt get the emotions out first, it clouds how I make decisions. "
4615,isfp,"Thank you supportivepistachio. I'm trying to think how often I remember to do this and yeah, I usually go to advice mode first, trying to give ideas to fix what looks to be the cause of the issue. It's automatic for me to do this and I don't tend to think about validating the feelings until later. Thinking about it now this seems obvious but in the moment, not so much. "
4616,isfp,"It's not a surprise seeing as intj doesn't lead with their feelings. Just think about emotional reactions from ISFP as a child cutting their leg, you're going to soothe the child before putting on ointment and a bandaid. I know that seems childish but were a lot more heart than head with feelings (we are obviously more logical in other areas) and it's probably something intj is drawn to for lacking it themselves. "
4617,isfp,I'd describe it that we always seem to be on different wavelengths. Frequent silences between us and moodiness on my part as I try to adapt to their more abstract thinking. I can tell they bore of my more concrete observations. It's a feeling of wishing they would express themselves more as I do and vice versa so that we could connect better. We do have glimmering moments of really getting along (especially activities and exploring new rhings) but just hanging out talking is a real struggle. If we go for a coffee or drink there are large gaps of silence. We basically have to be friends where we don't see each other for months and the  just have a day or two of catching up because once that's over it's like there's nothing left..even though I'd day we do have some things in common. They just come out wrong/our interests in those things come from different places. 
4618,isfp,"I'm a senior in High School. I've been thinking about becoming a Neonatal NP because I love kids and want a job where I can help people and is pretty hands-on (not just sitting at a desk all day lol), but I'm starting to have doubts. I've always kind of struggled in school... I get decent grades, but nothing exceptional enough to get into a really good school (3.2 unweighted, 3.5 weighted). School has always been difficult because, though I am fairly intelligent, I CANNOT stay focused and am unbelievably disorganized/constantly turn stuff in late. I'm not sure that a career requiring a Masters is very realistic for me. Also, I'm interested in health sciences/biology, but suck at math and get bored with sciences that aren't related to living things, so I'm not sure a medical degree would be the best suit for me anyways. What do you guys do for a living? What did you major in? How did you decide on it, and do you like what you do? "
4619,isfp,"Well I'm studying 3D animation and VFX, and I want to specialize in modelling or character design. I think you should pursue a career that makes you fullfilled as a person, no matter how hard it is. If it's sciences, then work hard for it, you'll enjoy it. Better be 8 years studying than 50 years working on something you don't love when you could have done better to yourself."
4620,isfp,"I work retail now, but I'm studying to become a personal trainer. I've lately been thinking about becoming a graphic designer, because art was my main interest in high school and it's something I care about a lot more than fitness(though I work out 6x a week and am in good shape), and also would find more fun. 
I went to a community college and dropped out, but I was planning on studying German if I transferred to a university. That probably will never happen so I'm just keeping my interest in language an interest & hobby. I was also a pretty average student in HS, but did terribly in math and that's part of why I never succeeded at CC, which is basically a repeat of HS in terms of required subjects. 
I've also thought about joining the military, but I have poor eyesight and a few things wrong with my legs so I might not. I'll probably just try a bunch of stuff until I find something that I like and that makes enough money"
4621,isfp,"You can use graphic design skills for so many things. It sounds like you‚Äôre young, so you have time to brand yourself. You should build a website, don‚Äôt worry about a deadline and you can do this slowly if you want to since you‚Äôre still pretty young. "
4622,isfp,"my relationship between me and my grandpa is pretty  normal from the old days. But things got pretty fucked up since the secondary school. Well, me and my grandpa just don't get along. Since my grandpa got the Alzheimer disease, he just ask some pretty dumb questions like:"" Where are my parents?"""" Where are my brothers? How is he living?"" He just asked that fucking questions for literally every fucking day, my parents and relatives answered patiently like:"" he have studied abroad"", and it repeated every day.Despite of living in a different house for a fucking decade, he still told the same to ask my parents to eat dinner for every fucking nights. I used to answered very impolite like:"" he have already gone"" ""That is none of your business"" Moreover, he just interrupted things. For example, when i sleep, the blanket hanging above the floor. he told:"" be careful, it is going to fall"" i roasted him and told him:"" That is none of your business"" "" instead of telling me, you just do it by yourself"". And he is like ok, and he fucking forgot in the next minute and he repeated himself again. And i angrily dropped it on the floor, the next day i apologize to him. I thought i would tell him like:"" the only thing you should care about is your fucking crippled life that will be gone soon. And time passed, it just increased my anger toward him to the point, i couldn't stand to his face or his existence any longer.Despite of being fully acknowledged that he is innocent and he doesn't mean any harm, i still angry about him. I try to surpress myself, one day he just did the same thing when he saw a dirty glass, and told
me to clean it and i said that wasn't none of his business, and that day i felt like i just eat a fucking grenade to my mouth. The reason why i stopped shouting him because i am afraid karma. 
However, sometimes i treat him with kindness, and warmth, i really did it. Now i am being stuck between two sides being kind to him or hatred to him"
4623,isfp,"Sounds like If it wasn‚Äôt for you, he‚Äôd have no one.  No matter how difficult this is now for you, it‚Äôs not forever.  You make a difference no matter what his words and actions are towards you.  You will no doubt learn several life lessons and come out a better man.  Take time to take care of yourself during this process.   Hang in there, you got this."
4624,isfp,"Hi! This is for a research abut MBTI & Music, some of you have answered the simple test (only two questions) and I have received a lot of feedback telling me to do another less simple with more genres I listened to you guys and here it is!

4627,isfp,"Im not sure, it is easy in the sense that the grammer is very straight forward and simple. It is of dutch origin but europeans think we are german from how it sounds. So I would say if you find german easy then yes it will be easy. "
4628,isfp,"I'm a native speaker who only speaks Spanish with my parents, but I always thought it was easier than English as well. I tend to get mad at my friend's who took four years of Spanish in highschool yet can't understand the language, especially the ones who are also Hispanic."
4629,isfp,"Its due to the fact that we were n colony, so we have a very wide variety of influences and words from many languages. But its really not worth learning. Its a tiny population, but we are almost all over the world. "
4630,isfp,"At the time I would agree that they were in it for a grade and not to learn the language. Now, all but one of the guys I'm talking about have expressed that they wish they had learned it and have attempted to learn it again yet still struggle. One of them did go to Argentina to teach English this past Fall/Winter so his Spanish has slightly improved."
4631,isfp,"Does anyone else feel like they cant have a close, lasting relationship with anyone because everyone has at least one MAJOR flaw?
If I spend too much time with anyone, I end up hating them for a little bit (this usually goes away in a week-half a year) and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not compatible with anyone.
I know I personally have many flaws like who am I to be so picky but idk this isn‚Äôt working for me"
4632,isfp,"Nobody is perfect and unless you are in a deep relationship with somebody by circumstance (war, sexual partner, strong belief, family etc.) You will always drift apart.
Why do think there is a criminal underground? Those guys hate each other! It because they have one thing in common, in this case money.
Let people present the best that they are. Dont poke and pry for everything because they will show you it. "
4633,isfp,"Yep. Completely relate, and it‚Äôs probably my biggest flaw. When I was younger my mom was worried I would never make real friends because I would constantly just move on from people. Now, I have a lot of friends, but I can still be like this with really close friends. I have a main friend group, and like 2 smaller, slightly less close friend groups. I finally decided to leave my main friend group this week because it felt kind of exclusive and judgmental of people outside of our ‚Äògroup‚Äô. Really, it‚Äôs mostly one of my friends who is like that, and the rest are kind of indifferent to others, but I was just feeling kind of trapped.
   I think emotional vulnerability is really, really difficult, and sometimes it is easier to focus on flaws and move on from that relationship than to stay and continue growing closer."
4634,isfp,"honestly, I think it's part of all relationships.  Friends, family, lovers, whatever... if you spend long enough with anyone they will annoy the HELL out of you.  I think that goes for any personality type, but maybe some types are just better at ignoring it or moving past it.    This is why alone time is very important for me to be sane. "
4635,isfp,"Lol I so feel this. One of my ""resolutions"" for 2019 was to try dating again (26 and always been single) and I only lasted one day before I deleted all the dating apps off my phone because I didn't want to talk to anyone..."
4636,isfp,At least he screwed up at the end. I‚Äôve been on (blind) dates that were weird from the start...and then I had to finish out the whole rest of the outing. I cringe just thinking about this one guy my mom insisted I go out with as some kind of ‚Äúfavor‚Äù for her friend at work
4637,isfp,"Curious, is it suspicious like this dude/chick wants to kidnap and cook me for dinner, or this dude/chick wants to steal my secrets to emotionally traumatize me?  Because tbh both are totally legit concerns but one of them is really paranoid, I mean who wouldn't want you for your juicy juicy dark meat amiright?"
4638,isfp,"It‚Äôs more like...one of those old crotchety house cats that someone tries to feed and the cat may look at the food, or come up and sniff it and paw at it...acts interested...and then walks away.
Like I see someone who might be of interest, but then everything reality hits...and I see every way in which this person is dishonest or could hurt me and I decide it‚Äôs not worth it to engage them."
4639,isfp,"Dang that sucks, I get that sometimes too.  Is it really hard to also see the way in which the person is honest and could make you feel worth it?  Like, they could enjoy a little bit of your bacon-wrapped thigh, and then you could also saute their kidneys in a nice red wine sauce, bam everybody wins.  Seriously though, is this tert-Ni at work?  I guess coupled with aux-Se that's why it takes so much time.  At least you know when you get one that it's legit feels."
4640,isfp,"Are you asking what the other type is? Or asking what I mean by my statement/the purpose of?
The answer to both is that INFJs are infamous for driving other people crazy with our absolutely daunting standards that we not only hold ourselves to, but expect of others."
4641,isfp,"I am an ISFP. I have developed such an interest to learning more about it now, and even passed on the interest to my bestfriend. I am married to an ISTP. We get along pretty great most of the time. I have a bit more empathy, and i am more ""altruistic"" so he says. I have a really HARD time telling people NO alot of times. If i have the means to help, i like to help, even if it means I suffer for it later. He tends to be a bit more logical and realistic than myself. I love that there are others who have the same issues, feelings, thought process, and insight as me. It makes me feel not so odd or alone in the world!"
4642,isfp,You sound like my husband and me but flip-flopped.  He's the ISFP and I'm an ISTJ.  He's so helpful and would do anything for anyone and I'm the practical 'told you so' grump. It takes all kinds to make the world work enjoy your ISFP-ness. :)  
4643,isfp,"Welcome to the community! (I'm a lurking INFP, which is a similar personality type in many ways.) Two of my closest friends are an ISFP and an ISTP, and what you described as the difference between you and your spouse seems very similar!
I've included a few links below that I think are great starters to understanding yourself!
Great broad overview to your type:

The reason I'm so interested in this subject is because it is really a great tool to help us in our personal growth/development. "
4644,isfp,"Hi, I don't know if you all have struggled with something similar, but I wanted to share.
Sometimes I hide from the world because I fear that outside forces will corrupt my values. Things like media, some social norms, etc. I realized that instead of avoiding things that are inauthentic to me, I should focus on BEING more authentic myself.
Instead of avoiding tasks I can't relate to, I should look at fortifying myself with activities which vitalize me. If I trust myself to live for my values, I will care less about doing the necessary minutiae. It's a form of self-respect. 
Feel free to offer a different opinion, I will be aware of any classic ISFP offense I take and calm down before responding :P :)"
4645,isfp,"I enjoy seeing how some of the media ideologies contrast with my values. It gives me a sense independence while at the same I try my best to be aware that nobody's perfect and therefore we gotta respect each other's beliefs. 
Also, the more I learn about the real world. The more I realize some of my values are very flawed and start to embrace change."
4646,isfp,"The way'd I put is that I know who I am and what I want and I hide from the world because it irritates me when it tries to tell me who I am or what I want. Also, being by yourself just gives you the freedom to do what you want lol.
I would say I should try to be a little more community orientated and less self absorbed but that's a lie. I don't truly believe that. That said I was rather suppressed as a child and coerced into being self sacrificing so maybe I'm just making up for lost time."
4647,isfp,"I'm sort of the opposite (I think). I've always done my own thing, and now I'm trying to understand the regular path and discover the merit in it.  
but i might have misunderstood. sometimes my brain struggles to parse the mbti lingo."
4648,isfp,"The problem is that interviews are fake,  and dominant Fi is all about being authentic. 
He's probably thinking, ""Lady, you already know the answers to these questions, all we're doing is exchanging formalities and having small talk."" That,  along with shameless self-promotion  (which is exactly what those interviews are) is so cringey to any ISFP.
One could argue that being an actor is ""inauthentic"" as well, but not really because it's an art, an extension of his creativity."
4649,isfp,"I too am bad at interviews so it's cool to see him pretty much being the same way. I thought he was going to use his acting skills to perform his way through the interview but nope, just being himself."
4650,isfp,"Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.

4651,isfp,"Hello, I don't want to upset anyone (because the topic is not nice) but I'm wondering about any ISFPs here who've come from alcoholic parents, bereavement, childhood abuse and neglect and how it affected your formative years.
Personally, my dad left when I was 6, my alcoholic mother called me ugly and said I wasn't worth anything. I was never hugged, was beaten up and I then spent years letting men walk all over me. I ended up co-dependent on others for self-esteem. 
When I found out I was an ISFP, I was happy because it gave me an identity and some explanations, but it's been very difficult to come to terms with the way I've been treated because my upbringing further impacted my personality weaknesses. 
My ESFP sister (a massive bully, to add to everything) dealt with it by being popular and funny. I had no coping mechanisms except to look for love in all the wrong places.
Now I want to help other ISFPs who have been mistreated because it kills me inside every day to think of those who were not strong enough to deal with the world like I couldn't. 
People's judgements and cruelty really bring me down. I wish I could reach out to all the ISFP kids struggling right now and give them advice. 
Nobody understands me and what I've gone through. Please share any thoughts, this forum is unlike any other for insight x"
4652,isfp,"So yeah, I never had a father and I had a really abusive mother for the first 13 years of my life. She would hit me quite often and would always say I was worthless and the biggest mistake of her life. She'd always try to win back my trust with some kinda food and I still struggle with food issues. I never had a stable home and moved something like a dozen times before I was a teenager. Never learned how to make friends and it's destroyed any chance I had to be social. Ended up moving in with my grandmother just as I started highschool. I was never able to really relate to her because she's really religious and I'm really not, and I always felt like her love was really conditional. I was bullied a lot in highschool due to my size. I'm 24 now and I really only know of 5 people I'd consider friends, most of them I've met online, and even then I only really talk to one of them. I've been in 3 relationships in my life. First one ended tragically. The second one was with a girl I met in HS. Was nice at first but then I figured out she was using me to get back at her old bf, who she then left me for again. The second was a guy I met online. We were really close for a year and I ended up taking a job near him so I could be closer. He treated me like shit once I got out there though, generally ignoring me and being really defensive when I tried to make things better. I eventually figured out he was cheating on me with someone else and after a long process of him trying to run both relationships like nothing was wrong I decided to end it. I now live by myself and really only talk to people at work. I work as a teacher and any time my students don't do well I blame myself and it really destroys my mood. Really struggle with depression and anxiety issues, and don't trust anyone enough to open up to them. When I think about it I always get really sad and sleep my life away, so I just try to ignore everything and focus on work while hoping for things to get better."
4653,isfp,"I'm currently unsure of if I'm INFP or ISFP, but I can relate to this. My mom died when I was 11 days old, so I was sent to live with my grandma & 5 other family members because my dad couldn't be bothered to take care of me. I lived with my new family for 14 years with the majority of them being emotionally abusive. I never did anything right in their eyes, & they couldn't see past their judgemental strict rules. They didn't understand that I was different from them. I moved back with my dad when I turned 14 because my grandma couldn't take care of me any longer. My dad & I never really got along (he's an ISTJ). My INTP brother & I got along at first but eventually I started to see him as more of a second father than as a brother, & we now very rarely get along. Basically my entire family is judgemental & very different from me. They lack the capability to understand my side of things."
4654,isfp,"I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever sought counselling? Do you have a support network? I hope you have good friends and people around you, away from them. You're not alone, there are people going through the same things as you x"
4655,isfp,"That would be amazing EyeHamKnotYew. It would be a life ambition to help people. I chose journalism over social work in college, and while I'm grateful for the fun career I've had, I regret not helping people or using my life experience for good. I hope to go back to college now x"
4656,isfp,"That's awful Flyboy! First of all, let me hug you xx Second of all, you should give yourself a break. The start you had in life has meant you had to toughen your naturally gentle personality - BUT - it's not your fault! None of it has been your fault - you didn't get the nurturing you needed and you can break free of it! Here's my advice:


Your depression is not inherent in you, you just have been given lots to be depressed about. Depression is not your normal state - you are not depressed for life. This is good news because you are only 24 - the best is yet to come.


Not having a father has meant you've looked for love with the wrong people. It's ok, I've done it, lots of people have done it. You're bisexual? You seem unsure of which gender can give you love, I say this because I tried girlfriends and boyfriends (I hated men because of my father). Bottom line, you just want love. But you mustn't give over a lot of yourself to people so they will like you - the problem with relationships is that you have to know yourself and like yourself before they will work. Right now - you just need to love yourself hunny bee <3 


Rumination on your perceived faults can cause your bad feelings because you're not confident enough to counteract them. Not only do ISFPs lack assertiveness - but your abusive background means you weren't given the tools to know the difference and to develop healthy self-images. You are NOT worthless!! You have been conditioned to believe this. You are 24 - you have your whole life ahead of you. Nobody told you the strengths and beauty you have. You can't see it because you think it will come from somebody else telling you. But you have to tell yourself how wonderful you are. And let me tell you - you are an intelligent human being with a big heart and love to give. Your gifts are endless. ISFPs rock - explore and develop your strengths :D


My grandparents looked after me too. Told me I wasn't 'good enough' to get my teeth fixed. This still makes me cry. You must realise you are not alone. So many people come from abusive backgrounds, there is strength to be had from realising how similar other people's experiences are. But we can't make identities out of our backgrounds. The aim in life is to be free - free of society, pain and regression. 


In this world, people put so much aesthetic emphasis on weight. My advice is to exercise for your mind and soul. You want to work on fixing the depressed feelings. Exercise really counteracts negative thoughts, and I really recommend reading The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle and Healing the Child Within: Discovery and Recovery for Adult Children of Dysfunctional Families by Charles L. Whitfield. You won't regret it.


When you start feeling good in yourself, you start to attract the right friends. With the right friends, you will meet new people and better potential partners (this happened to me). You are only 24 - you have so many years ahead of you. 


I used to sleep my life away but then I started to be pro-active on feeling better because as an ISFP, I lived in my own head for years. This led to rumination, spirals, acting out. When I got active and realised my life was my responsibility, things got better. They get better hunny. Life is beautiful when you see past other people's crap and realise how unique you are. Never put yourself down. You wouldn't believe how little other people know or what facades they use. As an ISFP, you have depth and so many unique talents to explore and develop. I'd hate to be anything other than an ISFP! 


Lastly, you've just made a friend in me :D That's if I haven't rambled on too much. There are so many things I've learned and I want you to feel better so much that I can't type fast enough! Hope I'm not too off the mark :) xxx

"
4657,isfp,"Hi Flrncpls, thanks for sharing. 
From what you've said, it sounds like you need more constructive guidance and direction from your parents, you sound so unsure of your decisions. 
If your dad is a professor, I'm guessing he's an -NTJ type - totally at odds with your FP type. TJs can be so blunt and difficult to live with, but their coordination and efficiency is admirable. He may come across as strict, but he probably means well and his TJ type will not be sensitive to your type. But that doesn't mean he doesn't love you. 
Lack of funds are an issue (but they're an issue for everyone). But you are only 16 - you have so many years ahead of you. My advice is to spend less time on Facebook because it's an endless vacuum of time loss (I've spent so many years wasted on FB, really regret it). 
Are you sure you can't draw or write? Because if you encouraged yourself, I'm sure you could create a lot of things. ISFPs are not very confident and need a lot of reassurance to feel good about themselves. Be kind to yourself and believe in yourself :)
To express your emotions, keep a diary every day. You will be amazed at what comes out when you write it down. And just be true to yourself - don't let other people's opinions affect you or bring you down. 
Am I rambling? I think the main thing is to be positive (when it comes to friends - your vibe attracts your tribe) and never rule yourself out of anything :) And here's a big hug :D xx"
4658,isfp,"Hi Ihatebeingabarista. That's an interesting thought. But could it be that SFPs are more willing to talk about it and need help because they were vulnerable in the first place? Evolution picks out the weaker folk, so SFPs' inherent sensitivity makes them targets perhaps. My ESTJ other half came from alcoholic broken parents and it has never affected him. He took charge. Also, INTJs aren't the best for emotional insight. They would deduce such calculations. 
I find it fascinating, I would love to research it x"
4659,isfp,"Hi babiekiller56789. In my experience, you need to distance yourself from your parents for awhile (if you're not still in school) and establish your personality away from them for a few years. When you are with them, you will absorb their nonsense - because it is nonsense! They are unhappy and want you to be unhappy because to see you do well would give them jealousy and confirm their own lives have been wasted in negativity. 
My mother used to pour mouthwash over my clothes. When I went to college, she berated me. Then I became a journalist and heard from my brother that she collects my articles. We haven't spoken in 13 years. But it's for the best. It's not easy, but I would still be listening to her calling me ugly if I stayed. 
Stick with the bass - make it your life! Stick with the band, make it a career. Don't let anybody put you down. Do not let other people offload their toxic shame, fear or bitterness on you. Be free and be happy. Big hug :) xx"
4660,isfp,"That's really good news :) Keep talking, keep the communication open, eventually the tears and shouts will reduce when he learns to see the person you are and that you are becoming an adult. You need a friend, not an enemy. You're developing, keep positive, keep going and love the person that you are :) Being 16 is not easy, but I'm sure your dad loves you and is probably coming to terms with the fact that you're growing up. Learn to laugh with each other :) Another hug xx"
4661,isfp,"It's a chicken and egg scenario. I thought ISFPs were considered 'sketchy' anyway because they 'march to the beat of their own drum'? Is that not a separate trait from their external circumstances? 
I wonder if there's something in how an ISFP presents their past? Particularly when communication is not their strongest point. 
I'm no longer sure what my point is :D x"
4662,isfp,"(Please forgive me if by posting this I offend or trigger anyone. This is merely a cathartic statement I've written for myself that I wish to share with others. Please indulge me by reading and letting me know what you think of my opinion on the struggle against suicide. Thank you.)
I know how it feels to feel down and out. 
To feel broken. 
Waking up every morning questioning my own existence and it's value to other people and significance to the world. 
I know how it feels to wear a mask for the sake of others while trying my best to fool myself into believing that very mask is my true face. 
The wish to die is not brought by pain, it's brought by fear. 
Pain can be managed, decompressed and dealt with. Pain is an aching sort of ailment, dull, depressive and hollow. But fear is far more potent. It is sharp and always felt. Fear is a difficult and ruthless beast. 
Fear gnaws away at your soul until you lose all control. You can't escape it. You can attempt disassociation or whatever other concievable coping mechanism imaginable, but fear will always wait for you at the door. 
Fear that you are not good enough, that you will never succeed. Fear that you are not loved, that you are hated, ugly and unecessary. Worthless. Pathetic. Disgusting. Unworthy. Fake. 
Fear is masterful in the art of deception. You lie to yourself and are caught in a cycle of self defeat due to false beliefs constructed by your own insecurities and weaknesses that fear uses against you to manipulate you into sabatoging yourself.
The only way to combat fear is to confront it. 
To confront fear is to confront yourself. 
Confronting oneself and emerging victorious is torturous. But a Phoenix must rise from it's ashes if it is to fly.
Shedding the ashes of insecurity, doubt and self hate and bursting into flame. All of your weakness melting away as you spread your wings taking to the sky, soaring towards the sun reborn. 
To live is to reinvent yourself.
The wish to die may never leave me and fear will always remind me of it's power and presence, but the beauty of the Phoenix is the power of rebirth. 
To die, to rise, to die, to rise. Never giving up. The eternal fight and cycle. 
So yes, I am one of many broken people. The desire for death I recognize is a part of me, yet despite that curse I realize I also desire to live. So I will struggle against fear to continue to live. 
I may lose battles now and again, but I refuse to lose the war.
I know some days I will be deceived and fall into despair. But I won't give up. No one should give up. It doesn't matter how far you fall. You can always climb back up. 
Failure is a choice.
Even if you lose your legs and are unable to stand, crawl. Surrendering is the greatest weakness of all. It is true cowardice. If you continue to fight, you will discover that drive to live is an unlimited source of power you can tap into whenever you need it most. 
That power is within you and will always be within you. It's your identity.
A human soul is the greatest weapon of all convention. Never turn that blade toward yourself, but to the heart of the negative manifestations that afflict you. 
There is a path out of darkness and into light only if you remove your hand from your eyes. "
4663,isfp,"Hey, hello there. I guess that if you posted this here then you won't mind me stating an opinion on it (yes you kind of said that in the description but just in case).
There was a time when I felt suicidal myself, i don't feel like that anymore. It was because of fear too, in my case, a fear of being unable to deal with the world socially and failing college and consequently losing my freedom by having a shitty job, being unlovable and not being able to travel the world. Phew..
I was in a deep pit of despair, even went to therapy and couldn't trust the therapyst and lied. 
What has worked for me was: time, lots of time, thinking a lot, being inside my head, isolating, suffering, you name it. Eventually my fatalistic conclutions about the world started to get simpler, i could define my fears concretely, i got real honest with myself, even if it was silly, feelings are valid. Things turned less and less important when i realized that other people were able to live different realities to mine and keep breathing, the whole world is built on opinions, perspectives, humans invented this whole social thing, even words, everything is extremely relative and your mind might tend to lock itself into what you already have experienced, your town, school, whatever, and you might think your life will never change (Isfp nightmare!). I won't tell you to not suffer, or to get thougher 'cause ""life is hard"", no one is right or wrong about anything, if you need to get deeper into that pit of despair do it, but also get out there, have as many experiences as you can and while you're at it try to clear your mind from any previous thoughts you've ever had, be blank, take everything in, nature, people, try not to speak inside your mind.
Mbti advice: you say you're an ISFP (me too), you sound like you're on an Fi-Ni loop. 
http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory#tert (please read this where it says ""Tertiary Ni (ISFP)  )
My advice basically is using Se, telling Ni to f*ck off a bit :) . (that's a daily struggle hah)
Btw, you might relate to this song: https://youtu.be/dnxCxHLAqn8 (Mbti talk, this guy is most likely an isfp too) when I'm down/lost/want to feel something deep, i usually listen to him. /also this song by the same guy https://youtu.be/ADP65wbBUpc (the lyrics are really good)
Alright that took me like an hour to write D': . please, process my words (?) visit the links, don't make me lose faith in humanity lol, comment afterwards? Have an awesome day!!! sending good vibes your way"
4664,isfp,"Hey! I remember you posted a poem here a while back-- and then deleted it. Don't be so hard on yourself. The stereotype is that isfps are laid-back, but a lot of people don't see how troubled and turbulent we can be. "
4665,isfp,"Thank you for sharing your story. Your experiences are valid and your voice is worth being heard. You are a resilient survivor and I think that's incredibly brave and admirable. Try your best, keep on persevering. You are worth it. <3 "
4666,isfp,Thank you so much for your thoughtful and detailed response. I can really relate to you. Fear is crippling and is the root of all my problems. I'll check out the links and also listen to the song. I'll let you know what I think after. Thanks again for taking time out of your day to acknowledge my opinion and share your own. Have a great day.
4667,isfp,"I remember you too! Yeah, I deleted it.. sometimes I feel confident in something I post and later on I find myself hating it and feeling embarrassed so I remove it. Yeah I agree, we can be very troubled people. This sub really is beautiful, people truly come together."
4668,isfp,"Thank you so much for your kind words. It brings me immense satisfaction and pride that my work touched you. I'll have to listen to that song, I'm sure it will fit perfectly with my piece as you say it does. 
I don't have a blog. To be honest, most of my work I have deleted in the past. I am very critical of myself and if I am not satisfied with something I've written I immediately remove it. I'm happy to say now that I'm overcoming that issue with myself and am starting to save my work and post it to reddit. 
It makes me very happy that you desire to see more from me and that is motivation enough for me to start a blog. Once I create it I'll notify you so you can read and give me your critique. 
Thanks for your response friend! "
4669,isfp,"From artist to artist, I‚Äôd like to say that your art will not always get the reaction you desire from other people. Don‚Äôt be sad or discouraged‚Äî because ultimately, your art is for you! It‚Äôs a beautiful reminder of how you‚Äôve progressed in your skills and how you‚Äôve grown as a person. You‚Äôll love looking back at it one day. And obviously art is important because it gives you and I a purpose in life, even at moments we doubt our existence and feel suicidal. You can love it or hate it, but never be ashamed of your art!"
4670,isfp,"I'm speechless. Ben Howard is magnificent! I was awestruck when listening to The Fear. I could feel the lyrics deep in my bones it was like I was travelling to a dimension of feeling and rationality so similar to my own that I felt at home. His voice is soothing and the rythm and melody of his music is powerful. I owe you many thanks for sharing his music with me, it was inspiritational. It's very self medicating. Any other music reccomendations? You have excellent taste. Thanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts and your music reccomendation in Ben Howard, you're a great person.  "
4671,isfp,"I will definitely notify you once I do that. I've never had a fan before, it feels great. I'm so happy that you appreciate my work, it truly motivates me. What sort of topics would you be interested in me writing about? "
4672,isfp,"Holy sh*t! Your comment put a smile on my face hah~ he's my favourite artist, i think i felt that way the first time I listened to Keep your head up (the other song i linked), specially with the line ""all i was searching for was me"". Yeah, soothing and powerful, i agree. 
Oh you're welcome, thanks for the compliment haha.. /Well I also listen to Jake Bugg (i like his Lighting Bolt song a lot) and some other more mainstream music (i like to listen to that when working out), none of that is as 'deep' as Ben Howard's, his music is like my special place or something, like when looking at the stars at night and thinking about life lol (i actually did that a few times while listening to his songs). 
Btw, you're a great person as well! Your response was so thoughtful and detailed, loved that! I'm so genuinely happy that you liked Ben Howard :)"
4673,isfp,"I'm happy to have made you smile. I'll have to check out Jake Bugg, I'm sure I'll like him as well. Music is amazing, it's power to heal and comfort is unrivaled by anything. It's always my go to next to writing. I'd like to make a name for myself as a musician but I'm painfully shy."
4674,isfp,"Yeaa :D. I agree. What sort of stuff do you write? Poetry? What instruments do you play?  Do you make up songs? I'd love to hear something. Dude I also write and I actually made up my first song on the way home yesterday and today because I had a very strong feeling and i just started singing (i usually think out loud in english when I am alone and sometimes add a melody, my first language is not english so most people around wouldn't get what i say if they happen to hear me, i'm very careful though). I already have a melody and lyrics but I don't play any instrument because I never know where to start and I don't like how structured and theorical music teachers are. Any advice? How do you make it fun? I have access to a guitar and a keyboard, I think I prefer the guitar though."
4675,isfp,"I haven't really listened to Lana del Rey, any fast-paced song of hers that you would recommend? (I usually prefer that pace, that's why I like Ben Howard). What r&b artists do you like? Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the song 'Secrets' from The Weeknd (my phone says that's r&b). You might also like 'Why do you feel so down' by Declan McKenna, it's a very sappy song hah.
I'm talking so much, oh well heh.."
4676,isfp,"I write stories and poetry. Lately I've been trying to start a story of a chosen hero who ultimately fails in his quest, yet his failure brings satisfaction to the reader instead of sadness and disappointment. I'm perplexed on how to create such a complex situation such as that, where your sympathy for someone excuses their failure because the failure itself is far preferred to the consequences of actually achieving the desired outcome. I'm very confused on how to deal with the whole idea but in time I'll figure it out.
I also write music. Although I'm very shy I don't mind uploading one of my songs to YouTube if you are interested in hearing. I play drums and guitar along with singing. 
That's awesome you want to pursue creating music. Start small and don't overwhelm yourself with the grandiosity of your ideas. Let the music flow through you and create itself. I recommend using instrumentals from the internet and writing lyrics to them and singing if you are a vocalist. If you want to create instrumentals yourself you can do that. 
I wouldn't say I make music fun because I tend to get lost in it. Once I come out and have to deal with editing and structure I become obsessive and that is torture itself when you desire perfection for yourself and not others. 
I would say get lost in inspiration and wistfullness and once you emerge from that session start editing it simply. Don't be too critical on yourself and do your best to make a finished piece.
I have a bad habit of getting stuck when I get out of the creative phase because the editing part of myself possesses me. 
Best of luck to you."
4677,isfp,"Sorry for the late reply and no need to apologize for talking I don't mind it at all. Interaction is a good thing. I'm not sure of any fast paced songs of Lana's but I recommend Born To Die. It's very wistful and alluring. Almost an anthem of hope and sorrow if those two contrasting themes were to be combined. 
I like the Weeknd, I've never heard that song though. I'll listen to it as well as Declan McKenna' s song. 
For r&b I would recommend listening to Post Malones I Fall Apart. It's very broken and beautiful."
4678,isfp,"So you write fiction, that's pretty cool imo~ that story's theme sounds interesting.
I'm definitely interested in listening to your music! Would love that :)
'Grandiosity' lol, i don't think that big about my ideas d: . I guess i'll take it step by step then, maybe practicing songs i already listen to. I'd like to create the instrumentals myself I think.
I'm so curious to listen to your music now, because of how you describe the experience of creating it.
Hey thanks! Good luck to you too."
4679,isfp,"Nah it's ok, i usually reply late too. Ok cool :) .
I listened to that song, .. not my type of music i guess but thanks for the recommendation though! 
Yea :D
About post malone's, it's neither of my preference lol xD #honestly . Thanks! 
I guess I like sad music with a little 'anxiety' to it lol. I guess that's not funny hah :>"
4680,isfp,"Here's 2 songs I uploaded for you to listen to. They are songs where I used instrumental beats from the internet and wrote my own lyrics and sang the vocals. I don't have any uploads of my own instrumental stuff yet. But creating vocals to premade beats is simple for me.

Tell me what you think, hope you enjoy.
Yeah, just take your music endeavor step by step, be true to yourself and create something you can be proud of."
4681,isfp,"I've recently found that two of my closest friends are ISFPs. Despite how you guys view the INFJs, I appreciate every part of you. You guys are deep, descriptive, warm, expressive, and most of all considerate. Every time I see my ISFP friends, I feel blessed to have met them. I feel like I've found hidden gems on earth. Saying ""thank you"" falls short in describing my appreciation accurately. But that's all I have for now. Thank you so much for being such awesome people."
4682,isfp,"There is a guy [25m] I've [27f] been seeing. He typed as an ISTJ, but I'm near certain he's an ISFP. Big difference, right? He's also in the military and I know some types get mis-typed as ISTJs when they're in the military. His personality fits perfectly with the ISFP. 
Anyways, he's been through a lot. His ex of 1.5 years (engaged as well) broke up with him, possibly got pregnant and lost the child at 8 weeks (gives no proof), he lost his job, only has one semester of school left for his degree, moved back in with his grandparents. Him and I met a month after his break-up and hit it off amazingly. Being in the military tho for 4+ years (he hates it), he went away for the annual training. When he got back, he's a completely different person. I read around about stress for different types and found this link I think describes what's up: http://personalitygrowth.com/the-different-levels-of-stress-for-each-personality-type/
The main bit being: High Stress: Under extreme levels of stress the ISFP may no longer appear like themselves. This normally sensitive and artistic individual may become extremely factual and focused on a sense of structure and order. They may lose sight of their passions and desires in order to make more practical decisions. They may lose sight of the joys that the present moment normally brings them and instead become focused on future outcomes. They may become extremely critical of themselves and place more pressure on themselves to perform well.
He broke it off with me after getting back from training (whatever 'it' was, I don't have a title for it, but it was more than friends but not friends with benefits but also not gf/bf because he wasn't ready for another relationship yet...but it was in the realm of gf/bf.) He said I did nothing wrong, he is working on getting himself right. He won't answer calls or texts. He keeps an eye on my snapchat and facebook. He told me before the break off that he was sleeping constantly, that he wasn't sure what he wants to do with his life, if he wants to get a job or not or go back to school or not or even if he ever wants a relationship with anyone again. A lot of how he worded things made it seem like he was worried about dragging me down since he feels he's ruined his life.
The link also says How to Deal: The best way for the ISFP to get back to normal is by accepting themselves for who they are. Instead of placing emphasis on structure and planning the ISFP needs to dive into what they are passionate about. Regaining a connection with their artistic or adventurous side is important for the ISFP. They need to reconnect with their emotions and their strong sense of morality. Instead of placing criticism on themselves, the ISFP will do best if they surround themselves with people who appreciate who they truly are.
Do ya'll find this to be true?
TL;DR: ISFP lost everything in life and is back with grandparents, went away for military annual training, came back a different person and pushed me away.
Any advice? He was really into me before the training and now has flipped switches, almost 180'. He wasn't even his happy outgoing self, he was like a shell. I'm giving him time and space, but also letting him know I'm still there for him. I haven't abandoned him or rejected him. I'm an INFJ, have always supported and reassured him everything will be alright. I've never told him what to do or what not to do. He chooses what he wants to do and we've always worked through it...until now."
4683,isfp,"He's breaking my heart tho...it's so difficult. He posted this pic on Facebook just an hour ago: http://nerdreactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ryan-T-Alexander-scorpion-sub-zero.jpg
I really want to comfort him, reassure him everything is going to be okay, be there for him. :( I just sent him a text, ""Always here for you _____. How are you feeling? Hope you are doing well."" Just to let him know I'm still around, still care for him. Back to no contact, I'm sure he'll figure things out on his own...I just wish I could help in some way. I know he's hurting."
4684,isfp,"Yeah I understand it must be super hard :( 
But speaking from personal experience, whenever I'm going through a super rough time, other's help don't really reach me. I have to mentally work through it myself first before coming out of my shell again. It's clear that you're still very significant to him though. "
4685,isfp,"Luckily I lead a pretty simple life, I‚Äôve just been promoted in the job I‚Äôve had the last 5 years, and I want to be a step higher, I want to sort out my finances, so it‚Äôs something like that. I‚Äôm working towards it with my chin up and as I go along I either add or take away from the goals I want to hit. "
4686,isfp,"Too much for comfort. I ve been thinking lately about how much i use it.
But its just true, I dont know some things, some things are unknowlable and I wont come with an animated lie just to seem informed."
4687,isfp,"Short answer: no but I've tried it.
Long answer: I had some success with short guided meditation using the Headspace app. So when my therapist suggested a Mindfullness Based Stress Reduction class, I signed up. But I had just started a relationship and just could not stop myself from thinking about him the whole time I was supposed to be meditating. Haven't attempted again since then. "
4688,isfp,"Yoga really helped me start! Look up Yoga/breathing techniques on YouTube. Helps get the technique down, my key tip is just always count your breaths/ focus on your breaths and calmly bring yourself back to that once you find yourself thinking about bills/school/family etc."
4689,isfp,"Yes but only when I feel like I really need it. Sometimes I get very overwhelmed with the people around me and all the things I have to do. So, I find at least a few minutes and I just close my eyes and focus on my breathe and I take as much time as I think I need. Hope this helps. "
4690,isfp,There are many different methods but the most straight forward is sitting down in a silent room and practicing clearing your mind of all thoughts for 5-20 or more minutes. Focusing on your breath or a single object like a spot on the wall or a candle flame helps. The goal is to remove all of the mind's chatter. 
4691,isfp,"Same here! I started with yin yoga, which is super slow and meditative which then got me into meditation. But I like yoga as it really gets you out of your head and into your body more for when you're feeling overwhelmed. "
4692,isfp,"I usually score in the middle on mbti tests for S vs N, and T vs F, and on cognitive functions, I usually score high on both Se and Ne, but slightly higher on Se. Clearly, I know something is off, but for some reason I just cannot grasp which function I truly use more. After reading into it a lot, I was fairly certain that I was an ISFP, because I‚Äôm very practical for the most part, and am very interested in sensory artistic experiences (music, cooking, some sports, etc. as opposed to activities such as writing or drawing which I find insanely boring) and intuitive descriptions don‚Äôt seem to fit me well.
However, my mom has recently gotten REALLY into Myers Briggs (specifically the C.S. Joseph videos on YouTube... she‚Äôs basically watching them all straight through), and she said that she is 100% certain that I‚Äôm an INFP. I don‚Äôt have a very good sense of self perception, and how others describe me usually surprises me because it‚Äôs not in line with how I typically view myself. So I guess it is possible I‚Äôve mistyped myself.
I absolutely love INXPs, and many of my best friends are of this type, but I‚Äôm not sure that that is what I am. So, since I know ISFPs and INFPs are pretty similar, because we all lead with Fi, how do you, as an ISFP know for sure that you are an ISFP? "
4693,isfp,"I'm not entirely sure, if functions are indeed invalid, because my entire understanding was based on that and shadow theory.  My preferences are split nearly 50/50 f/t and s/n and no description of any ""complete"" type ever fits 100%.
I'm not altruistic.  
I require hands on experience to fully grasp an understanding of a system.  
My beliefs must be supported by either personal experience or empirical truth; in fact I have a hard time taking anything touted as belief seriously, because the ""why"" question needs to reconcile or else it holds no weight.  The spiritual/metaphysical is still fascinating and worth exploring because of its unknowns.  It's important to be open minded but no, anything is not possible unless we are living in some kind of matrix (but who can tell that? it's an endless cycle).  
I love anticipation.  Once I'm actually there, the thing becomes surreal and I feel like I'm sort of out of myself.  It's very hard for me to be present, but physical sensation is very exciting to me-- a taste, a smell, the way something feels, a sound-- these are the things that make me feel alive.
I've taken several tests and not once tested isfp.  I think I'm kind of a hard case, and it seems like a lot of us are.  Isfp was suggested to me once and the conversation I had with the person who suggested it leaned heavily on every isfp looking different, almost like the only common thread is that none of us seem to fit anywhere else; it's almost like isfp is the catch all for wierdos who defy definition.  Nobody really knows what isfp really means.
tl;dr idk lol."
4694,isfp,"For me, I don't really like Ne and it confuses me a lot of the time. If I believe in or like something, I like to hold my ground and not consider any alternatives. In a way, following the Ne way of thinking feels like I'm admitting defeat or something."
4695,isfp,"You might be in the middle. Myers Briggs is a construct used to described the people out there, but it doesn't mean there aren't blurrings of lines or people who fall in between or out. I would say that you know yourself best and if you feel like you resonate more with an ISFP description then I'd say you lean more towards an ISFP but may not be as ISFP as others are. "
4696,isfp,"I have the same problem and I am slowly digging deeper. I met with a counselor at school who was an INFJ and she was trying to figure me out while going through study techniques for both INFP and ISFP and her deciding factor for me was the use of the ‚ÄúMemory Palace‚Äù study technique, which I hadn‚Äôt used in the past. I am yet to continue digging but other than that I‚Äôm still on the fence as well "
4697,isfp,"I‚Äôm the same with the 50/50 splits for the middle two letters, however I‚Äôm almost too altruistic and can‚Äôt ever stray from what I think is the right thing to do (which probably makes me pretty boring in person, whoops lol.) But that‚Äôs why I think I‚Äôm Fi dominant.
But other than that, I 100% agree with everything you said. I question everything and have a hard time believing something unless I can see it for myself or have experienced it in some way. I have a hard time grasping ideas that aren‚Äôt tangible. Like, in school, I love social studies and science (that has to do with life, so anatomy, biology, health etc.). But I struggle with math and English courses because, after a certain point, they‚Äôre mostly made up rules and procedures as far as I‚Äôm concerned (wtf is a cosine, anyway?!).Im a hands on learner, and if what I‚Äôm learning about is not somehow connected to a physical object or person, I‚Äôm probably not going to grasp it very naturally. I‚Äôm also really interested in the spiritual/metaphysical! I always like learning about religions especially, because it‚Äôs kind of cool to see what other people believe and how their belief systems formed and all that. 
I remember reading a thread a while ago about how the ISFP personality type seems made up, and your last paragraph reminded me of that. Maybe it is, and ISFPs are just the leftover weirdos who don‚Äôt fit into the other types lol."
4698,isfp,I am easily stressed at work. I put myself there at 100% and what stresses me is that my client sometimes has ideas taken straight from moon and I try to meet deadlines for those ideas and I'm stressing I will not meet them. When actually I should tell my client to get his shit together and plan workflow properly.
4699,isfp,"Yes. More over social stuff, like worrying if my friends actually like me or if they're secretly talking behind my back. Also, stressing about what actions will affect me in the future and the ones that don't. I push it to the back of mind so it doesn't interfere with everyday life, but if I don't find some outlet to vent my feelings, sooner or later I will have a breakdown. "
4700,isfp,"ASMR is like visual meditation is to lucid dreaming. Imma hook you up with that good sh!t.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMSILdW68zc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFqAvcuuCeA"
4701,isfp,"I've doubted myself quite a bit in the past, but now I have a pretty average level of self confidence. When I was younger everything was me doubting myself. I should go tell them a joke and introduce myself! No I don't want to waste their time... I should get a job! No, they wouldn't hire me anyway... I should draw something! No, I'm bad at drawing and I wouldn't like it enough...
It was all thoughts like that and it kept me modest, yet not living my life to the fullest extent. I also have a stutter which terminates my self confidence even more. Well it did when I was younger."
4702,isfp,"I used to not have any at all. I think it stems from the fact that I feel this huge need to be perfect - drawing something ought to be perfect on the first go-round, I should win all games without even trying, etc. So when those things didn't happen for me, I went waaaay far in the other direction. 
Now I'm still very... I don't know, I still feel that need to be perfect. But I've realized and internalized that it's going to take steps for me to be perfect, that I'm not there yet, and every mistake is another step closer. As long as it's better than the last try, it's good. And I'm begun to constructively criticize myself as well. Instead of, ""Jesus, did you dump the entire jar of salt on this steak, you idiot!"" it's more, ""About half as much salt, maybe more cayenne as well."" 
Also, I just stopped caring a lot, in a good way. No one else cares as long as whatever tastes or looks good, even if it's not perfect - it's just me. :)"
4703,isfp,"I feel like this really depends on the situation. In most new situations, no. In circles or places I've been to but had bad experiences, of course not. However, if I have a good handle on the place and/or people around me, I do."
4704,isfp,"I definitely have a lot of self-confidence issues. Like u/EphemeralSpectre this has hindered me from doing some things. I've gotten better at that just by going for things despite if I feel like I'm ready for. Doesn't really help me feel more confident, but it has less effects I guess lol.
Short answer: No, I wouldn't."
4705,isfp,"I like to think I have a modicum of self-confidence. Enough to know my talents from flaws, anyway. I'm in the service industry so I have to initiate and participate in several interactions a day, and I hold my own, and my confidence issues aren't really hindrances, I guess."
4706,isfp,"I would say my self confidence comes & goes. When I feel like I am on a roll with projects, social activities, ect. I feel like the sky is my limit. When I start to hit roadblocks it slowly tears me down, but I suppose that would do that to just about anyone. 
So I would say I'm pretty average. I try to be aware of what I am doing and saying because when I'm not doing that roadblocks come up a lot more frequently. So I'd agree with stella_artaud when I say its probably more about self-awareness than confidence directly."
4707,isfp,"-We tend to underestimate ourselves (making us shy about posting and feeling irrelevant)
-We also tend to be extremely private people (hardly easy on a sub about personality)
-We have Se aux, so a healthy state means doing a lot and with others because it is extroverted, which does not quite fit a sub on the internet about a psychological theory. 
-But we also tend to take for granted stereotypes about us (not having to say much anyway)
-Which leads us to conform to a type, to be stagnant and to not ask ourselves enough whys and how to improve (no offense, I still think we are amazing people and I love you all, but for real)
-Start action my dude we're all down for good challenges when they're here B)"
4708,isfp,"Honestly, don't really have an idea. But as others have commented, reddit isn't really a place where ISFPs congregate. But, well, that doesn't mean we can't do anything about this sub either... 
But we also need a new banner. And I've also thought of making an art subreddit specifically for us ISFPs, when I have time, in case verbal expression is not enough. I mean, we are known for being one of the most nonverbal types after all... (and it might also be a great outlet for our suppressed feelings)"
4709,isfp,"Your classics like My Favorite Murder, And That‚Äôs Why We Drink, Spirits, etc. However, I also listen to podcasts that relate to my current interests, such as the Female Farmer Project, and I‚Äôve been looking into some Lutheran podcasts (I‚Äôm kind of in the process of converting?) Overall, entertainment and niche interests."
4710,isfp,"I just started dishwashing out of desperation to get money and damn so far its surprisingly one of the best jobs ive had.
Best things about it:


seclusion!!! You get your own room to wash dishes alone and you can play music the whole time. I cant wait to download some audiobooks to listen to.


easy. Its simple. All you do is wash stuff for 6 hours, take out trash, then you leave. No multitasking. No dealing with the public!! I find the time flys by.


people leave you alone for the most part. Just wash the dishes and youre fine. No drama. No stress. Great if youre socially anxious.


Pay. The pay varies from place to place but its usually better than minimum wage. Im getting $10.50/hr which is not amazing but its the most I've made so far.


free food. Im sure this varies from place to place too but i get 1 free meal per shift and the foods amazing.


Anyway yeah. If youre looking for introvert jobs i recommend dishwashing at a small restaurant. If you dont mind the physically taxing aspect of it. Personally ill take physically taxing work over mentally or emotionally taxing work any day. Anyway im NEVER going back to serving after this."
4711,isfp,"Hahaha, oh my god. This is crazy.
I was a minimum wage dishwasher and busser at a pizza place in Seattle at the end of 2016, and I consider it one of the best, easiest, and most rewarding jobs I ever had. 
The waiters would socialize with me sometimes to rant about silly customers as they dropped off their trays at my station (which was always funny), and I‚Äôd get to overhear the kitchen staff joking around with each other (who was also always funny). 
Outside of that, I didn‚Äôt have to socialize much and I found doing the dishes through the machine therapeutic.
Hm. I‚Äôm out of a job right now and I might consider finding another dishwashing job after this post, hahaha.
(My end goal is to continue as a freelance photographer with some online passive side income, but for now I could use the money.) "
4712,isfp,diminishing returns. how much of what you spend so long thinking about is actually going to benefit you in practice? 20percent of your work contains 80percent of your return.. the rest may not be worth it.
4713,isfp,"So, I have an ISFP personality type, obviously. I was wondering if anyone else here has had to cope with social anxiety and/or depression. It's really frustrating, I'm already quite shy, and I want to make friends and hang out, but I'm too damn scared to talk to people. No one ever initiates conversation with me. I consider myself quite approachable. I don't look at my phone much when walking around or sitting down, I almost never have headphones in, I keep my head up, I smile a bit, I don't cross my arms. It's even harder to talk to people when they're always looking at their phones or computers, listening to music, are talking to someone else, or have a very unfriendly look on their face. I also suck at talking to people when they're in a group(that shit's intimidating). I feel like I need some sort of ""excuse"" to talk to people, or they'll think I'm weird for talking to them for no reason. I have some valid excuses for talking to some people, like I've been trying to work up the courage to ask this girl if she wants to study together, but she's always with her friends and like I said, that's pretty intimidating to me. Yeah she's pretty cute, but I'm trying to make friends, and I think this would be a pretty good opportunity. I'm fairly certain she'll say no, because she asked if I wanted to study with her one weekend, and I obviously said yes. She said she wasn't sure when, so I said she could come by any time( we live on the same floor). Well surprise surprise she never stopped by, which I find rather odd because she asked me, but whatever,  there's a reason I don't set my expectations very high. And I did really well on the test anyways. I'm not mad at her. Like it is what it is, I just find it kind of strange. That's besides the point, and I have another excuse which is pretty strong but i feel like she'd see right through it. 
I know people my age get annoyed when older people say phones make people anti social, but damn, they definitely aren't wrong. I guess the phone thing was a culture shock because phones weren't allowed during the school day, and what do you know, people talked to each other.  But anyways I've gone way off topic (did I mention I have ADD?)  but how should I, a shy, introverted, socially anxious, weird, first year college student make friends when no one is open to conversation? 
Also not helping my situation is the fact that I am currently without a roommate.
TL;DR- How should a weird, shy, introverted, socially anxious first year college student(18m btw) make friends when no one wants to talk?"
4714,isfp,"I understand many of the points you shared, especially the intimidation with groups. I guess the root of your problem is your lack of confidence. You're already making yourself available, even tried to reach out to someone once, these are good baby steps to making friends. Unfortunately, so many people nowadays can't process (or refuse to) read very subtle social cues anymore because we're always ""sort of busy""--i.e., with our phones, with the music only we can hear, etc. I get frustrated with this too. Like you, I keep my head up, wear a friendly face and not use my phone when I'm in social situations or even just in public spaces. But rarely do I meet someone who'll put their phone down to notice the presence of other people around them.
So if other people can't recognize subtle social cues, try to step up your game. Say hi to more people, share tables with strangers, speak more often even if it drives you nuts on the inside. All these are possible when you build up your confidence. Try to practice speaking in front of the mirror, make a list of topics you'll be ready to talk about anytime, and be kinder to yourself.
There's nothing wrong with being shy, introverted and socially anxious. So many of us are too. I'm 26 and I still use those words to describe myself as well, but when I want to make new connections, even if it really makes me anxious (as in my palms would sweat profusely), I just take the leap. Just say hi."
4715,isfp,"Boy, just be confident. It isn't easy, it's weird af at first. Teach yourself different cultural customs. Try going to a gym? You'll find other people maybe work out buddies, AND! you'll be moving to have a more healthy/appeasing figure. Plus it feels great to be strong, to be able to help anyone who asks. Learn to love yourself. Don't go full up your own ass but learn and accept what you suck at, and don't. Believe in yourself and stand tall. Women and men respect sure people. Maybe that girl isn't interested, or is also afraid. Don't sweat it, don't push it, and move on. There are billions of people on earth and you found person right, right down the street? Go play the lottery because that's lucky af."
4716,isfp,"She was probably unsure with a vague answer like ‚Äúanytime‚Äù. If you put a time on it, even a range like 5-7pm, they‚Äôll feel an obligation to come at that time. 
In other words, she might‚Äôve been just as shy and anxious."
4717,isfp,"If you accept your 'flaws', social anxiety decreases.
A good exercise is looking at other people's 'flaws' and then using compassion to dissolve judgements. Like if I initially thought you were weak for having anxiety. I could dissolve this judgement by realizing that you're simply another human being yearning for connection (like everyone).
Now use the compassion towards your negative thoughts. 
Also, exercise and healthy eating does wonders. "
4718,isfp,"Well I'm INFP and I've been plagued with a sense of wariness of others for basically all my life;  males with this type are known to be socially anxious to one degree or another, so I get that. It's not so much the ""anxiety"" part that is a major issue for me, it's the fear,  the reservation, and the apprehension. My advice, would be to sit near a group of people who you think are decent at college, and hope they'll talk to you first, and then go from there; that's how I did it in college and work anyway, and it's always worked for me.  You know, you've gotta talk to me first if you want to talk to me at all.
‚Äã
A friend of mine, which I'm fairly sure is ISFP, used to have similar issues to you especially when starting new jobs, but this subsided and now he has several other work friends and gets on alright with others from what he's told me, so if you're anything like him, it could go away with experience. Another guy I know with this personality type used to have it, yet still manages to go to real-world  'meets' with others which is beyond me. Neither of these people seem to be super concerned about what others think of them, where as for me and other individuals with this type this is pretty much a given.
‚Äã
I'm not trying to downplay it, but I think the type of social phobia ISFP and INFP's have is somewhat different. Since learning about MBTI and typing people around me, it's like every INFP I know fits the online description of being ""quiet, reserved (at first), and sensitive"", it's like we'll always be the ""quiet one"" in the eyes of others, no matter what, like everywhere we go. Dunno if this'll help but I'm just sharing my experience."
4719,isfp,"I completely agree! I was going to volunteer in the Children's Ministry at my church, and the lady in charge said to just show up anytime to help. So I never showed up. If you don't already know someone super well, if you only create very vague, loose plans, they might be uncomfortable because they don't want to risk being an inconvenience. Try bringing it up again and setting a specific time!"
4720,isfp,"Maybe this is silly but I wish there was a way to meet people based on their personalities. I'd love to talk to another ""me"" and share similar thoughts. I've spent a lot of my life caring a lot about adapting to others and it'd be so nice to know some people where that wasn't the case too you know?"
4721,isfp,"Yeah i found out I was just going along the flow without actually knowing who and what I want. My music and hobbies were cultivated from my friends influence, now we are all grown up and hanging out less, I start to see this isn't the stuff that i want. Ever since, I am learning more of myself and been working on me but soon I need to get myself out there and meet others. Might be quite unhealthy to be alone for too long. Anyways, try Meetup.com, search in isfp or something, or join the Facebook group isfp. But it'd be better to spot them irl, go to art events, craft markets. "
4722,isfp,"ISFP here. I am the same. I did not know about personality types until I met my INTP husband. We have moved away from our home towns and are pretty content with just each other and the kids. I used to long to meet fellow ISFP females, but since having a family, I am pretty content. I find that being just myself with the family has allowed me to be myself without all the influence from other personalities. I tend to just absorb traits from others. Until becoming more if a loner, I did not realize I'm actually a pretty outdoorsy person and I now enjoy taking the kids out in nature trails and neighborhood walks. I am also pretty creative as a domestic and enjoy being creative with cooking and crafts around the house."
4723,isfp,I know it's stereotypical but you are likely to meet other ISFP's at an art class I think. I know it's stereotypes but I do know a lot of ISFP artists so I think taking some kind of art class would be a good bet. 
4724,isfp,"WOW, this is absolutely me too. I was always so discouraged that I wasn't worrying about my identity like the people around me and put all of my energy into them and their desires that I kind of lost myself and ended up not being there for them too. It was really painful for me and I wasn't aware of why. Trying to re-evaluate who I am now, and be willing to trust new people again. It's really encouraging to hear you going through that too, thank you. "
4725,isfp,"That's really beautiful. I've spent a lot of my life in really serious relationships and I've always wanted them to last and to be married if it was the right person. I knew that desire at a very young age and I think I put a lot of my identity into that and that was probably overwhelming for my partners. I can see myself being really satisfied, like you, with a family around me. I'm still kind of recovering from a long and intense relationship and trying to navigate being single after so long and new friendships and myself and it's pretty strange! I know some of my traits angered her quite a bit so being around people like me would help so much to understand if those things are healthy or not. "
4726,isfp,"Oh my goodness me!!!!!! I never thought that had something to do with my personality type. I have issues with all attention on me. I hate it. It‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôm eloping. 
I feel like it‚Äôs so much pressure!!!! Something I started doing is just not getting on Facebook at all on my birthday. I felt like it was so stressful telling everyone thank you and it was taking away from the day. Not to say I‚Äôm not thankful for people taking the time to wish me happy birthday, it really means so much. It was just taking away from the day. I now get on there and personally thank each person the day after! "
4727,isfp,"My friends will decline my invitations to hang out every now and again, but they never turn down my birthday. Such a good excuse to get all of my close friends and not as close friends into the same area doing some nonsense. Normally I do a barbecue and tell people to bring their own beer. I love my birthday."
4728,isfp,"I‚Äôve always had something really important that comes up on my birthday so I‚Äôve never really found it special. Last year I travelled to Australia on it because that way it was a good excuse to ignore the birthday messages lol. But I like the placement of them, not necessarily the attention that comes with it. "
4729,isfp,finally someone feels the same way I do! i really dislike my birthday I always feel like I have to live up to people‚Äôs expectations and never truly enjoy myself. I really like celebrating other people‚Äôs bdays tho
4730,isfp,"I'm just okay with it. As a kid it was always great to get gifts and have visitors, but nowadays I don't really have much I want (well, I do, but they're too expensive to ask for a birthday gift) and I don't really have many visitors I want to see. The people I do want to see I see on a regular basis anyways. And yeah, the attention is really ugh."
4731,isfp,"Hi guys,
I‚Äôm an INTJ and recently I‚Äôve been thinking about what I‚Äôve observed watching the ISFPs that I‚Äôm close to in my life. Let me start by saying, thank you for existing. You guys can be refreshingly genuine and non judgy in a way that makes even shunned people feel accepted like no other type and naturally, as an INTJ, I appreciate that. I secretly look up to healthy ISFPs for their kindness and noble qualities.
I‚Äôve noticed that ISFPs tend to almost seem to have two sides to them, their normal selves, and also a different side which is more withdrawn and contemplative. When in such a mood, the ISFPs that I know reveal their interest in all types of topics such as spirituality, aliens, the occult, conspiracy theories and all other manner of things typically associated with Ni thinking.
I‚Äôve also seen it the reverse where INTJs have a need for self expression in similar ways to what you‚Äôd associate with ISFPs (having a certain style about them/artistic expression...).
I just thought it was interesting to bring up, as I‚Äôve noticed this pattern with many type combinations i.e. INTPs with inner ISFJs, ENFJs with inner ESTPs, INFJs having an inner ISTP side to them and so on.
I‚Äôve also noticed that when mature these types become more and more indistinguishable and it becomes hard to distinguish a well rounded INTJ from an ISFP for example  just by their appearance and demeanour, and vice versa.
Does this resonate? I‚Äôd like to know your thoughts :)"
4732,isfp,"I'm so glad you've said this! Yes, I've definitely noticed it, too. I can't tell older ISFPs from INTJs -until I get to know them better. ISFPs are definitely more robust/rugged in a physical way, compared to INTJs. My spouse is ISFP. I consider them like hybrid types (halfbloods, lol), half N half S people, who just get more and more N as they grow older. Their INTJ side can get really depressive and brooding, though, because I do think it's them falling into a loop after not getting out of the house for a long time. Still, I do believe that we get more in touch with our weaker functions as we grow older, and we'll be able to wield them with more .. finesse/carefulness, in a healthy manner. Sometimes their Ni will just appear out of nowhere, and floor you. A well-balanced old ISFP is sexy af."
4733,isfp,"INTJ and ISFP have the same top four cognitive functions in different orders, right? So it would make sense that as they mature and even out those aspects that they could appear more similar.
I'm engaged to an INTJ :)
We struggle with communication sometimes but this relationship does so much to help both of us grow and become better people. "
4734,isfp,"Yes, exactly. Their INTJ side can be brooding and depressive, in the same way an INTJ can also be if they are indoors all day, stuck in their head. Personally, I‚Äôve found a day out can be really change my mood and perspective for the better. 
However, INTJs typically have it worse, especially in their younger years as they tend to unfortunately, struggle socially and as a result can keep to themselves to the point of isolation and extreme loneliness (I‚Äôm speaking from experience).  I think it‚Äôs especially true for both types if they‚Äôve experienced some kind of trauma that they‚Äôre holding onto from early life.
Also, yes. ISFPs are sexy as hell, even when they‚Äôre young. They‚Äôre blessed with that effortless sensuality about them."
4735,isfp,"How do you feel about communicating in an online community? I know that some people classify themselves as lurkers and am just curious on how many of you enjoy actively communicating with strangers on the internet? Also, how different are you socially when in person?
Whenever I want to say something online (with strangers at least, I'm cool about it on FB), I just kind of sit there and stare at the computer trying to think of what to say. Most of the time I just delete what I'm writing and go somewhere else. I never even think about posting on largely popular things. In real life I'm much more spontaneous and willing to talk to people. I'm a bit shy sometimes, but I find it relatively easy to hit it off with others if we're both willing to converse."
4736,isfp,"Me. Me. Me all the way. I'll start writing a FB post, or take a picture for Instagram, and then right when I'm about to post it I think ""Ehh, no one cares. deletes post"" On FB chat or here on reddit I'm okay though, because I have time to think about what I want to say. 
In face to face interaction I CAN talk, and I do sometimes, but I always feel like there's an underlying pressure to think fast. When I pause to think, and my eyes start wandering across the room as I'm scrambling to find the right words to use I feel like people will sometimes become impatient, or take my pause and glancing away as a ""Fuck you, leave me alone"" vibe (Which sometimes it is, some people are just too damn nosy). 
I think there's actually an article somewhere that I read once that explains why introverts communicate better via IM or texts because there's that middle man (The computer, the phone) that's between the introvert and the other person that relieves the pressure of communicating. That is especially true of me. I don't have much trouble texting or IM'ing, but try to talk to me in real life and I'm at a loss for words. Unless I'm totally 100% comfortable with you and we're like bff's.
Edit: Grammar. Again, I need time to think about what I want to say, and I need to review it in my head to make sure it sounds right."
4737,isfp,"Hmm. What you described is what I do in person. Online, it's much easier for me to communicate.
If something is largely popular and I don't feel like what I'm posting is worthy/interesting enough, I'll often just shrug and move on. But a lot of the time I'll still post anyway, even if I know it's probably going to get passed up.
I'm definitely not willing to talk to strangers IRL. I won't turn them away and I'll be polite, but I'm usually not very talkative because I'm so uncomfortable. I've been told I look like I have a ""fuck off"" sign on my forehead, haha. If I'm in a situation where I'm with a bunch of people I'm comfortable around, and there's only one or two strangers, I'm more willing to converse because I'm much more comfortable."
4738,isfp,"I enjoy my time communicating with an online community. I remember all the days I've spent on a MMORPG and all the cool people that I've had conversations with. They never discriminated me for my age, gender, class, etc and were very receptive to my curious mindset. I never had to consider how people looked like or observe their body language and that made it easier for me to talk to them. 
In person, I feel like I have a lot of things to consider when I talk to people, whether it be body language, their personal background, their facial expressions, mood, etc. I take into account in my head whether or not what I'm about to say is appropriate or adding value to the conversation or else I don't say much at all. There ARE times that I've been receptive to strangers, but they were always receptive (and welcoming) to the things I had to say. "
4739,isfp,"Yep, that's me. Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, online dating, and the like. I'll write two sentences and think better of it. I've probably left a lot of karma on the table.
I have the same issue with face to face interaction too, compounded by a stuttering problem (not bad, but enough for me to notice and be self-conscious).
That's why I prefer text. I can't stutter with a keyboard, I can't get interrupted, and I have a chance to triple-check before I send anything."
4740,isfp,"So I know this girl, and we've been talking for a while. We're just friends, but I think she likes me. Anyway, she recently told me she hasn't shown me ""the real her"" yer, which was like throwing a giant piece of cheese at me, lol. I don't know if she did that on purpose or what.
I read that the ISFP type can be reticent to show their real selves to others.
So, ISFPs, particularly women, how/what does it generally take to get you to open up more?
If you're curious, I'm an ESTJ. Not sure if ISFPs and ESTJs are a good mix. Relationship type stuff seems very opposite as for as stereotypes go. ESTJs are very loyal, a little but more ""safe"" and reliable, while ISFPs are described as being slightly more flighty/fun types. Haha, no offense anybody--they're just stereotypes anyway.
I'd love some input, though! : )
By the way, I'm 29 and she's 28, so we're not like teenagers or anything going ga ga all over each other."
4741,isfp,"to open up i usually have to know you for a good while and feel that the other person and i have a deep and strong connection. when that happens, the person is definitely very special to me. 
edit: i'm surprised she admitted that though, i think it's a good sign that she's honest about that :)"
4742,isfp,"Does anyone else feel this way?
I want to stay where it's safe but then I'll never grow or do amazing things in life. Still doesn't make me get out of the rut I'm in though. I thought I was adaptive but I'm quite scared of change."
4743,isfp,"I'm glad I'm not the only one like this! It's pretty sad because I'm still young and have my whole life ahead of me but I think I've really begun to stagnate due being afraid of taking any steps that feel uncertain and unsafe. Part of it is probably because I've experienced a lot of hardships growing up and just want some peace and stability in my life. Ironically, things can never be stable until you make it so, or so I keep telling myself. I'll get around to overcoming my own obstacles one day, I swear..."
4744,isfp,"Yup :( This is pretty much my main battle in life. But yesterday I took a step I've been afraid to take for a long time. I never thought I'd actually be brave enough to do it, and I did it! I know it's hard, but you can get out of your comfort zone! The only person stopping you is you. You're braver than you think you are!"
4745,isfp,"INFP here, who thought to be ISFP for some time. I can definitely relate. I know we can only develop, when pushed out of our comfort zone, but it can be difficult. My INFJ mum used to say ""changes are the only thing that are constant"" as in they will come for sure at some point."
4746,isfp,"I definitely know the feeling. Moving forward is equally as scary as standing still for me. 
Every so often I'll have a day where I'm incredibly motivated to get going on something, move forward with my life and accomplish goals, but if I don't act on it right then and there, it passes and I feel this overwhelming fear and insecuity about my future the next day. I never used to have any of this as a child, so it must just be the way I've learned to think over time as an adult, but I know that it can always be changed.
Once we actually make that leap and make the really big changes and decisions in our life, I'm sure we won't regret them. Its just a matter of building up the courage to get to that point.
This is also unrelated, but man, a lot of us seem to have animals in our usernames!
Badgervibes, Grumpynightowl, Thunderthehedgehog, Glamsterhamster.. We should start a club over here ;)   "
4747,isfp,"Hello there.
I did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).
I was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.
Here's the survey.
Feel free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay since there was a fetish survey a week ago on /r/MBTI. Hope it's alright!"
4748,isfp,"Sometimes I find music that I feel describes me better than I could express with words and I want to show it to everyone. 
Does anyone else have moments like these? I feel like it's a very ISFP thing. 
For example, this song: 
http://youtu.be/t-TStLN2oMg
Edit: I love how everyone is sharing songs that are so much more about the music than the lyrics. And it's all mostly stuff I haven't heard of before. Y'all's ISFPness is on point. "

4753,isfp,"This is so hard to answer for me.  Music is something deeply entwined in my soul, and what I post below are songs that evoked emotions in me like no others.  Hard to describe really.  Im not sure if it describes me better than words, but I guess if its the music my soul resonates the most with then that could be the case.
To add, this type of music is quite weird.  When I find someone who truly digs this stuff, it means more than just similar music tastes.

Aesop comes and goes in my musical life but he'll always be relevant and a have his place. If he plays Daylight on Monday (I doubt he will) I will bust a nut."
4757,isfp,"Hi! I'm a 22 year old lady. Here's my life story sorry its so long!
My childhood was very mild. My whole family is very education-centric and liberal so growing up was all about learning and maturing at a steady pace. I have one sister (ENFJ) that is three and a half years older than me. My parents (mom is INFJ and dad is ENTP probably) split when I was 7 but they never fought in front of us. They had some trouble communicating after the divorce and tended to use me as their messenger but that only lasted a couple of years. My sister and I lived with my mom and visited my dad every other weekend. Money was tight but we made it by. 
My mom is a midwife/lactation consultant/NICU nurse/mother-baby guru so I always grew up around that stuff. Pregnant women everywhere. I knew where babies came from when I was 3.
My sister and I did not get a long. She's very extroverted and dramatic and sporadic. My mom and I both found her to be very draining in her teenage years and the tension could be pretty stressful at times. 
I was very shy until high school. I was silly and loud with close friends but I was otherwise quiet and well mannered. I didn't push boundaries or question authority at all. 
I went to public school at all levels. Made good grades. Was always involved with some kind of project or club. Had a job in retail for 2 years in high school. Pretty much did what was expected of me. 
At 15 I began to experiment with partying and breaking rules. I snuck out of my house very often with a group of friends I had met through my best friend. It was easy because my mom trusted me so much and I never gave her a blatant reason to worry so she never suspected anything. We would go to parties and drink pretty heavily but not dangerously. Kissed some boys, broke into public pools--stuff that seemed very risky and cool at the time. Never once got caught so I never experienced any real punishment. Now I look back on those nights and I think being able to make those decisions (and get myself out of tricky situations) made me more independent and prepared for living on my own. 
Right after high school I spent a year abroad before starting college. I went with a group of 21 other freshly graduated kids, mostly Brits, none of whom I had met before. It took a lot out of me being around people every day and always having something planned for us except on weekends and a couple of isolated weeks. I definitely didn't take advantage of every opportunity but I still super loved it and that year made me so much more confident and grounded. 
Now I'm in my last year of college and I'm still changing and experimenting and just having fun! I'm currently single because I find that when I'm in a relationship my brain turns to mush and I can't make rational decisions for myself. Also I don't like people ever. And when I do, I'm a dweeb and can't talk to them without being a weird bro-type. 
I live in an apartment with one other girl a bit older than me. I work a bunch as a waitress/bartender, pay all my own bills and feel like a real adult (until something breaks and then I revert to fetal times.)
Ok, yeah wow. Ever start to respond to something and realize you had a lot more to say than you originally anticipated?  "
4758,isfp,"i feel like the title is somewhat misleading and not worded correctly but anyways. how do emotions look in your heads?? and how do you deal with em.
for me it's like a whole jumbled up mess of string that i can't seem to untangle... so much at once.. so i just push em down til i'm ready to deal with them at a later time. which can be both a good and bad thing i guess "
4759,isfp,"Idk I think my emotions can manifest in many ways... sometimes I can picture my emotions as little characters. Like insecurity would be like a highly avoidant person who would shy away from people a lot and be like ""Noooo... don't come close to me! why are you getting close to me!"", while happiness can sometimes take over my whole body... sometimes I imagine myself ranting at people, not that I would usually do that..."
4760,isfp,"I feel like I've learned how to internalize in such a way that my feelings do happen in my head. I intellectualize them. Particularly strong feelings like love and affection I have a hard time allowing myself to really feel, because of past emotional trauma or whatever. And if I feel very upset or angry it feels physically uncomfortable so I tend to seek out ways to numb that as well. 
For the most part I am pretty even and not easily overwhelmed or disturbed and I like that. Try to keep it on the chill side. I am definitely not the warm, affectionate type with any person except if I'm ""with"" someone and even then I go through periods of isolation and reservation."
4761,isfp,"They take complete control over me. I'll cry, I'll shake, I'll feel euphoric. I have trouble calming them down and usually I have to find a quiet spot to center myself again, listen to something to block the feeling out of my head, and recover.
Sometimes I wish I didn't have emotions, but then I remember all the good things they bring me, like passion to keep pursuing the things I love. :)"

4763,isfp,"So supposedly SP types, including ISFPs, are very impulsive in general. That's true in my experience, though depending on if this is really an ISFP thing it's not always in a good or even proactive way.
I find that a lot of my impulsivity manifests, for lack of a better word, in laziness. I'll have a small part of a project as a daily goal, for example to complete a transition between two songs or something. But as soon as I start, I'll decide it's high time to go make some coffee or a pasta sauce, or maybe watch that Youtube video I just remembered. Useless stuff like that, that is fun for about ten minutes until I realise I just wasted all that time.
And as for positive impulsivity, like calling a friend over or going on a walk... well, then my old friend overthinking (alter ego probably Fi-Ni loop) steps in and tells me to stay in the house. :
I guess the purpose of this post is twofold - to find if MBTI has any explanations for this and to help any other ISFPs who may have this issue feel less isolated, given the ""go-getter actioney ISFP"" tendency, or stereotype, or both, whichever it may be. Also random curiosity. :D

4764,isfp,"Wavpug summarized it so nicely!
My energy goes in spikes. That means that when I feel that rare inspiration to so something that is actually productive I have to surf the wave and try to do as much as possible. When I'm not inspired to do that thing I don't even lie to myself anymore. I don't even consider doing it.
I think it has to do with our dom Fi. We constantly evaluate what is worth or not and, at least for me, I can do something when the ""vibe"" is right. Sometimes I don't feel it's the right moment to do that thing that I really like to do. Other times I have the urge to do that thing cause now it feels the perfect moment and if I don't I feel my mood gets down and I am unstatisfied."

4766,isfp,Hi guys I hope you have a good day! answering my own question I get along very well with ESFP‚Äôs at least with my friend that is one because she always to understand every point of view even if she doesn‚Äôt necessarily view the issue the same way and I never tend to feel drained when spending time with her. I have a few friends that are ENFP‚Äôs and I get along with them fine but they do drain me quite a lot and I also regularly feel frustrated when interacting with them it might be because we view things differently so they might just feel as frustrated either what‚Äôs your opinion I‚Äôd love to hear it
4767,isfp,"Honestly? I tend to get along with most of the types pretty well most of the time. That said, I tend to consistently hit it off the best with other NT types and TJ types but, I‚Äôve hit it off amazingly well with F types too! Particularly ENFJs, ESFJs, ISFJs, INFJs, ESFPs, and well I just found out my current voice instructor (I‚Äôm an opera singer) is an ISFP and she‚Äôs awesome! üòÅ 
I‚Äôve clashed the most with INFPs, ENFPs, ISTPs, and ESTPs, for whatever reasons. We just talk past each other and end up arguing (usually about something rather silly) for some reason and I‚Äôm always left wondering, ‚Äúam I speaking in Russian or something? AAAHHHH!‚Äù "
4768,isfp,"I'm married to an ISTJ, but we don't always get along (lol, yay marriage!),  I have and ISFJ friend who I get along well with, but find very boring though.  I have another friend who is ESFJ and she very likable and fun to be around. She also knows the right things to say to make me feel comfortable.  She has  ALOT of friends, which is really my only gripe.  
I'm not sure about the other types, but I can tell you right now that I clash with anyone that has a hard on for the rules.  If they follow rules for rules sake and can't see any grey area, we gon' clash. "
4769,isfp,"I get along with everyone pretty well. The most noticible ones for me are 3 of my friends, ESFP, INTP and I think the third one if an ENTJ. I have two friends who are ESTJs, I like them and they're good friends however at times I don't understand them and their logic annoys me a bit. "
4770,isfp,"I really get along with INTP‚Äôs. All my closest relationships are with them. My sister, my best friend and my boyfriend are INTP‚Äôs. Then after that generally I get along with INFPs I find their mediator qualities make me feel at ease. "
4771,isfp,I've been told I should do improv because of how weird some of the stuff I say is... Like I can visualize what I want to say in my head but I can't quite get it out there. I feel more at ease voicing my thoughts if I'm clearly engaging the person I'm talking to (like if they are reacting as I'm speaking). 
4772,isfp,"For me, it I've learned it really depends on my confidence levels. Which I can't really figure out. Sometimes I'm more confident, and other times I have no confidence at all. It seems like there is a somewhat strong correlation with the environment I am in. But sometimes I'll be with my closest friends, and have 0 confidence in my ability to communicate something. And the more I think about it, the harder it then becomes! Maybe it's an issue of me overthinking it. Overall when I am confident, I communicate much more clearly. And when I am not as confident, everything comes out all scattered and its really hard to get my point across, no matter how much I have prepared or have thought about what I am going to say."
4773,isfp,"I need to get in ""the zone"". If someone asks me something immediately I might have problems voicing my thoughts, but If it's me who wants to talk then I get in a comfortable flow. That's probably because when I want to talk then I already have the conversation ""prepared"" or my thoughts grouped.
I also have problems with holding a ""small talk"" type of conversation, because I prefer to speak when I really have something of value to say, I keep most of my thoughts to myself."
4774,isfp,"Im decent with verbal communication it depends on who I'm talking to and how much I trust that person with my feelings. It also depends on how much I understand my emotions, if I really trust someone and I can tell theyre listening to me I have no issue with talking about my emotions, opinions, etc "
4775,isfp,"Like everyone here says, it depends on the person. If it‚Äôs someone I don‚Äôt know, I usually narrow my communication to single sentences without giving information about myself. If it‚Äôs around people I know, I‚Äôm usually not scared to speak my mind."
4776,isfp,"I'm okay with my friends. But with family or at work I'm awful. I'm doing assertiveness training right now but I feel like I'm taking 2 steps forward and 1&1/2 steps back all the time üòÖ Because I'm so bad at it, I try prepping what I'm going to say in my head, but it never comes out sounding like it did in my head üòÖ With friends it's no problem usually. "
4777,isfp,"I guess I am to an extent. Talking with aquaintances are a breeze but also brief. Usually it involves only questions or convos about school stuff or work unless they share personal stuff, which I find that other people share to me a lot. To friends I'm starting to learn how to not hold myself back. Talking feelings out usually doesn't settle well with me though. Nothing else can make me feel at ease when voicing my thoughts until I've decided I want to let them out."
4778,isfp,"Did it ever happen that when you are not confident or under a certain pressure or stress to say something you regret later? Like something that probably does not even make much sense, something off the top of your mind, the very first thing that comes to your mind...and then regret it?"
4779,isfp,"Oh yes all the time. Most of the time in stressful situations, the thing I'm trying to communicate just comes out weird. I get the information across accurately, but it's often scrambled, and I have a hard time shaping my words into something that can connect with the audience. And it's hard because it's really obvious to me that I didn't communicate very well, and then I start regretting the words I chose and the way I delivered it."
4780,isfp,"Hi, I'm a 21 years old ISFP and I sometimes feel kind of self-conscious around unknown people while doing stuff like eating or studying etc.
Is it common in our personality type? If it is does it go away when you grow up?
Fun fact: I even got self-conscious while writing this post and edited it about 4 times before finally posting."
4781,isfp,"It‚Äôs common for ISFP, it‚Äôs basically because we have a high internal awareness (strong feelings) and then we try guess the perspective of what others might think or feel. It makes us feel nervous/anxious when we can‚Äôt really guess what others are thinking. It‚Äôs why you re-wrote the post 4 times. "
4782,isfp,"No, just a man.
I don't think I'm moody and I almost always stay cheerful, rarely angry or frustrated.
But I do get a little anxious about not being ""perfect"" (?) Like, being singled out for doing something foolish or something like that."
4783,isfp,"I love this one. I never think people listen to what I say, so when someone brings up something I said in a previous conversation and looks into it more on their own time... it just makes me feel so so so happy."
4784,isfp,"Interesting! I'm vaguely familiar with this chap, Jung. I see he developed the introvert/ extravert personality type concept, which is something I am familiar with. Would you consider yourself an introvert or an extravert, based on your understanding of his work? Just thought of a question, if you're interested. Any theory on weather or which a Jung-type introvert/ extravert personality concept could clash with, or lend to, the ISFP defined personality concept of the MBTI?"
4785,isfp,"I am an ISFP, so I definitely prefer Introversion over Extraversion. I would say my Extraverted capabilities are under developed at best, but that's something I'm working on. I know that some types don't always get along well with certain other types, both from experience and hearing stories (example: ISFPs and ESFJs tend to clash), but I think that as long as each person is aware of and respectful of the boundaries and limitations each type has they can enjoy a happy relationship. "
4786,isfp,"because I have trouble expressing the depth of my Fi, I used to feel like I was too ~deep~ to be understood. it was okay if people underestimated me or thought I was dumb because I consoled myself with the idea that I had this depth that which only I could understand. :/"
4787,isfp,"I don't know if I am one, but sometimes I do privately feel better than other people in some ways. in a lot of ways I know I'm worse though and my self esteem is not great for the most part.
usually if I say anything about me being better than others it's supposed to be in jest, but some people think I am being serious so I try not to make certain dumb jokes around some people"
4788,isfp,"Can‚Äôt say for all of them but the last guy I dated was absolutely one. I spent ages afterwards feeling terrible about myself until I realised he was gaslighting me. I suspected he might have been one but I always felt crazy for thinking it. A work friend reaffirmed my feelings after I broke down in front of her and she told me I was being emotionally abused. 
The worst part was feeling crazy and being unable to rely on my memories and my own thought process. I had the opinion ISFPs were cinnamon rolls and that he couldn‚Äôt possibly be so manipulating! But the types don‚Äôt apply if he was mentally twisted."
4789,isfp,"Nah, I just think I'm speshul and unique‚Ñ¢  sometimes (shameful to admit but I'm a walking ""I'm not like oTHEr giRls"" persona on bad days). I don't think I'm great though.
Some might be narcissists... but I don't think it has to do with personality type, as I think NPD is a mental disorder (I think?) that anyone can have."
4790,isfp,"So I did this thing a few years back and didn't really think much of it, but a few of my friends are big into it so I did it as I've changed a lot from when I last did it. I got ISFP and I related to a lot of the things I was reading. the one thing I don't though is the whole 'Artist/creative' thing Like I'm not a musician and I'm not good at art (not one of them people that says they're bad but are actually good) I just don't relate to the whole thing of being artistic and creative. Like I understand that not everything with these personality tests is gonna be 100% accurate but I feel like maybe I got one that doesnt really fit me? idk just curious as to what other people felt about what they got."
4791,isfp,"Yeah the descriptions (especially on 16personalities) are very embellished. What they mean by artist is that you're usually detail-oriented or that you appreciate beauty. The cognitive functions are much more important that the artist label. Introverted feeling, extroverted sensing, introverted intuition, and extraverted thinking. Do some research on them. If you're read through the cognitive funtions and still can't relate, then you're probably not an isfp. But you're not the only non-artsy isfp. You don't have to fit neatly into the description. For example I hate sports. That doesn't make me any less of an isfp. "
4792,isfp,"""creative"" does not mean good at art. it means that you can find creative solutions to problems. such as when i was playing D&D, i found a way to use the bones of my enemies, some rope, and some slime to use as climbing gear to get deeper into a pit"
4793,isfp,"As the title states. I'm a male, she very clearly sees me as a guy friend at this time, we've been just friends while we were both with different people. She's been single for a while, and recently I've become so as well. Thing is, someone who used to be good friends with me, and I, met her at the same time, we both wanted to make a move but he told me about it first so I respected it and let him, they were together for a short while but they're just good friends for a while now even though throughout that friendship he told her he loves her several times, he is dear to her but just as a friend. This person and I are no longer friends, I took him out of my life because of just how arrogant and I inconsiderate he was, but now he is still good friends with her, more than I am, and I am friends with her but now I feel like I wanna be more than that. What do you guys think of the situation? What do you think I should do? Is there a way to let her know of my intentions that wouldn't rock her entire world? Would she even be willing, considering this friend of hers?"
4794,isfp,"Speaking as an isfp female, well... U deserve chance to confess ur feelings to her, but its her choice whether to accept u or not. Try doing activities with her (physical activities, maybe)  which she enjoys doing, so u guys can get closer. "
4795,isfp,"Thanks a lot for your reply! It makes me happy that you say that I should have that chance to express myself, it might work or it might not, but do you say this despite the moral dilemma of ""the friend""? How do you think he ties into this whole situation? Because he might be more understanding of me seeing as we are no longer in contact, but for the ISFP who he is close to it, it'll definitely bother him and the ISFP wants to have a friendship with him. "
4796,isfp,"We ISFPs value friendships and dislike conflicts. I'm certain ur girl would be upset when she finds out that u are not in good terms with that guy, and she knows that either one of u will leave her if a romantic relationship is formed. However, this is the risk that u should take if u truly want ur feelings to be acknowledged by her, otherwise she will only recognize u as a friend. As for the guy, I'm not sure how he will react to this, but like I said before, u deserve chance to express urself. Good luck!"
4797,isfp,"I'll just state my observations. I'm not a professional so it's better to get an accurate diagnosis from a psychologist.
Okay, from what I see, she seems very troubled and looks depressed.  Depression may cause people to get easily frustrated or angered, even over small or insignificant matters. Birthdays can be painful for a depressed person as well. Maybe she felt ""humiliated"" and felt that she ""doesn't deserve the attention."" She could also beat herself up with negative thoughts that ""she's a mess"" and ""screwing things up."" And also, I think that she doesn't want to spill over her emotions into the people she cares about that she may not want to ""burden"" her loved ones with her problems so she push You away to try to minimize her perceived damages. The reason why she stopped making any plans is because it seems that she's no longer happy in the activities and things that she once enjoyed. That includes people too. Because of that, she doesn't see the value in relationships. And as a result, she tends to push You away (again). But it doesn't necessarily mean she don't want support/help, it just means she's not sure how to ask for it. Your friend needs help, patience, acceptance, and understanding. Try to give her enough space but don't let her completely isolate herself. And tell her that as a friend you'll always be here for her.
I hope things get better for You and for your friend. Keep your head up."
4798,isfp,"This happens to me. I think it could be a completely different thing though. Sometimes I'm just so not in the mood to talk or hang with others, or when i am hanging I hope that it ends soon. This isn't always the case, just my introversion taking effect occasionally. Your friend sounds depressed in my opinion, I completely understand her feelings and she seems to be in a dark place."
4799,isfp,"Very possibly. I think the best course of action would be to just confront her about it. Cause she's hurting you too. And that isn't okay for a friend to do. Maybe she doesn't want anything to do with you anymire, but if she does then hopefully she'll respond constructively and apologetically. You can't make her want to hang out with you, but you can remind her that your relationship means a lot to you by proving that you're willing to work at the relationship."
4800,isfp,"You're welcome. 
I think that she's socializing with new people because they don't know about her. It's easier for her to face strangers because she won't feel exposed (her depression) unlike to face the people she cares about and know that she's making You and her loved ones sad by being how she is. "
4801,isfp,"Considering the fact we're pretty reserved and value privacy? I once read a thread where they typed Michael Jackson as an isfp and something like he was pretty introverted, but when he was on stage he transformed in this badass with sexy dance moves. Would you experience stage fright or if the media gets on your skin, would you have a Britney Spears-esque meltdown? 
Semi-related but I'm not sure how good am I with entertaining a crowd however I always dreamed of being the person playing guitar at 1:33"
4802,isfp,"I don't think I'd handle it well. I like privacy and being famous seems like the exact opposite depending how famous you are. Like I would never want to reach Michael Jackson fame because everyone knew who he was and he could never go in public without people being all over him. I love the days when I go out by myself and I'm unbothered and that would never be a possibility. On the flip side, it'd be really, really awesome to know how much happiness you bring to others' lives. 
On your comment about being on stage, I have a similar feeling to you. In high school I was a techie for the drama department and often I would think about how cool it would be to be a performer on stage instead. "
4803,isfp,"I feel like I'd be like...I dunno, Hillary Duff. Famous, does her job, but generally stays out of the limelight unless it's related to work.
She might not be the best example but she was the first to come to mind.
I don't think I'd go out enough or do anything crazy enough for the paparazzi or media to harass me THAT much. All they'd get is ""Starburstnova went to get groceries...as she always does on Wednesdays...""
Overall I think I'd handle it okay. The hardest part honestly would be dealing with fans. I'd be super appreciative of them, but trying to keep up with them and socialize with them would leave me feeling drained. So I fear I would come across as cold, ungrateful, and unappreciative. But then again with the internet, I could probably connect enough and not feel as much pressure to do it in person."
4804,isfp,"Jimi Hendrix had the same effect when he went on stage. He felt the most confident and comfortable with a guitar in his hands. As an isfp musician myself I feel similar. I feel nervous thinking about it and before a show but once on stage it's all about the feeling of the music, the crowd is only barely in mind. Due to the expression exertion I experience a meditative state from the feeling of frequency and vibrations. I feel fame would be better handled through the arts for us because we can sort of ""hide"" or disguise ourselves.  "
4805,isfp,"I don't think I'd handle it well. I like to try to blend in and not be noticed which is hard because I'm 6'3"" and 270. I'm pretty easy to make out and feel that I stand out badly. Part of that may be social anxiety making me think I stand out more than I actually do. Point being I don't handle it too well now so I don't think I'd be able to leave my house knowing so many people would recognize me and want to interact with me. "
4806,isfp,"I wouldn't be able to handle it.  I've legit had nightmares where I became a famous celebrity.  Nothing out of the ordinary ever happened, I just became big and famous and I had all this attention.  That kind of thing scares me because of a huge lack of privacy.
Anonymity is underrated.  "
4807,isfp,"Yeah same. Except personally I would like to be ""known"" but not exactly famous. I do want to leave my mark on this world, no matter how small. The best way I can describe it is ""famous enough to have a wikipedia page but not too famous that the page doesn't take more than one or two scrolls to get to the bottom."""
4808,isfp,"Absolutely yes.
Kinda funny how I like to do things on a whim because I like to live in the moment...but if somebody else offers a spontaneous change of plans it irritates the hell out of me. Probably because it wasn't my impulse and wasn't planning for it.
At least I'm aware of how annoying I'm potentially being when I do it to others! That's just in regards to events/plans with people, but yes I'm definitely impulsive in many aspects of my life.
Sometimes I'll plan to do something for two weeks, looking forward to it the whole time, but when the time comes I don't feel like it and do something else. Sometimes I impulsively buy things I don't need because I saw it and it seemed cool. Sometimes I'll completely change my hairstyle after thinking about it for only two days."
4809,isfp,"I make impulse purchases and I'm more likely to say yes to going out if it's all of a sudden - if I have to spend 3 days thinking about going out, I'll probably try to find an excuse to get out of it. I won't impulse big decisions like moving or career wise. "
4810,isfp,"I definitely am. I picked the college I went to on a whim.. I thought the post card was pretty. I picked my wedding date by guessing a random number told him to pick a month and whenever it landed on a Saturday was our year. Sometimes it can be 3 in the morning and I should be sleeping but I suddenly have an urge to go for a walk or do this super cool craft I saw on Pinterest. I'm a mess, no real plans just ""eh that sounds fun, do this""."
4811,isfp,Sometimes I am it really depends for me on what kind of activities I'm doing. I'm pretty good at holding back with purchases but like to run my days off on impulse activities than a set in stone plan. 
4812,isfp,"Hey guys, newly discovered ISFP here, I'm sloppiest ISFP ever without good manners, moral behaviour, without artistic ability/creativity and my jokes typically goin' too far and be weird. Anyway, what'ya all been up to lately?"
4813,isfp,"Dude. Maybe you are stupid ISFPs compared to me then in this way.. It's the right thing to hug strangers. This guy INSISTS I'm an ISFP, you know what, I haven't been able to find my type for ages, so maybe I'm just not the stereotypical ISFP then."
4814,isfp,"The guy that typed you clearly doesn't know enough actual ISFPs (or he sucks at spotting types). Also people are delusional and project Fi everywhere... I don't see the slightest indication that you're an ISFP though. I'm sorry you might have to consider you're mistyped, you're way different from most ISFPs from your posts"
4815,isfp,"If either of those, then ENTP. ESTPs are shitty pricks. ENTPs may be shitty sorta naturally but at least they can think and because they can think they can become better person, or at least have LIMITS (jesus ESTPs, fuck y'all just saying)"
4816,isfp,"I've done that. ENTPs are quickthinkers eating me up intellectually, creatively, wittingly and let's face it they're not really that nice. So basically what I'm saying is: ENTPs smarter and more quickthinking than me."
4817,isfp,"ISFP or not, I just appreciate the house and wow, why am I not filthy rich again? :(  
(Completely OT, I just wonder why I couldn‚Äôt just be born into a wealthy family, like, sure, the world would hate me for doing absolutely nothing to earn my wealth, but I mean, who cares? I got money!)"
4818,isfp,"Even when they do...
J. K. Rowling said she's an INFJ and half the MBTI community thinks she's a wannabe INFJ and is actually an INFP lol. 
No."
4819,isfp,"Any other ISFPs seem to have trouble finding jobs? It might just be my specific circumstances, but I'm curious.
Being a fairly quiet and introverted person, customer service type jobs don't generally suit me. (I can do them, but I'd prefer to be more behind the scenes)
I'm also in college (full time), so that limits me to part time work.
I've applied to at least a dozen places in the past month, only have managed to get an interview with one of them. Didn't get that job despite the interview going fairly well."
4820,isfp,"Ive been struggling for a few months now but finally got hired as an animal care taker for a pet shop. Im excited because itll be in the back of the store and i wont have to do customer service which i hate and ill get to hang out with animals. I think itll be a good fit and i cant wait to start on tuesday. 
Maybe that job would be a good fit for you too? Either way hang in there, i hope you find something you like."
4821,isfp,"So, just trying to figure you all out. It seems like as a type, you guys have a tough time externalizing thoughts. Totally relatable as an intp, as I really enjoy when people just ""get it"". So what do you wish people understood when talking to you? 
Speaking generally is ok, but come on... the personal specifics are always an interesting treat "
4822,isfp,"I wish people would have the patience to get to know me. I'm a very private person but once you earn my trust and get to know me I'm pretty cool. At least in my mind. I wish people knew that I have a group of friends. I feel like my peers think I don't have many friends/cling onto acquaintances. Which is partially true, but I do have a solid group that I regularly interact with. It may not seem that important although it would really help my self-esteem if I knew I was higher up on the social hierarchy. Another thing is that I wish people would get is I'm much more than nice and quiet. I can be sarcastic. I have strong opinions. I'm stubborn. I crack jokes and love dark humor when it's done well. I wanna rebel and experiment with drugs. I have a reputation of being a goody two shoes and it would be nice if people knew there was more to me than being this shy and awkward person."
4823,isfp,"I'm not sure if it's that I wish people knew something about me, it's more so I wish that people didn't overlook me so easily.  In a lot of cases I end up as a ""third wheel"" of sorts when I'm out with friends, and I'm not often taken very seriously.  "
4824,isfp,"Something that frustrates me the most is that my friends, whom I've known for years, still assume that because they do not know every detail of my life, that I don't trust them or feel close/comfortable enough in our friendship. Here is my thing: I've been through some rough patches but I've never felt the need to tell anyone because there is nothing that can be done to change it. Why bother living in the dark times when the NOW is bright and happy? 
I'm not secretive or guarded - ask me anything and I'll give you the honest truth. However, I prefer to live in the now and take life as it comes rather than dwelling on the past. I've made a lot of mistakes. I'm terrified of what people will think if me when they find out. But I am by no means uncomfortable or distrusting of my friends. "
4825,isfp,"I wish my roommate/long time friend understood that I don't talk about my life activities. He thinks I hate him. I'm pretty sure he also thinks I have no life outside of work because I hear his girlfriend joke about how I never leave the house except for work; I just never announce where I'm going when I go out. I love spending days at Chapter's and my favourite guitar store.
I've never told people about my day to day life. The only time I share thoughts is when I have something to discuss that explores an opinion I have. Things like music, video game design, people in general, and other things.
I've told him this before but he still doesn't get it.
I also wish people understood that I don't like partying. I don't like to drink a lot or do drugs, I'm picky when it comes to music, and I don't small talk well. People think I make up fake excuses to not go parting but the truth is even though I've had good times at parties before in my life (before I stopped drinking to get drunk), it's always been such a draining experience that takes days of emotional recovery.    "
4826,isfp,"Sometimes people think I'm not having a good time with them, because I'm quieter and I don't really express enthusiasm the same way they do-- and they stop inviting me to things because they say I seem bored or disinterested.  I wish they could see that I enjoy them more than it seems!  I'm like a dog trapped in a cat, and I have this curse that I can't reveal I'm actually a dog."
4827,isfp,"i wish people knew why i sit alone in a crowd of people during lunch.
i wish people would not simply think i'm strange for not sharing during a conversation in witch i have nothing to add but find interesting. 
i wish i could get close to someone and openly share feelings with them."
4828,isfp,"Uh oh, definitely guilty. Sometimes when I see some hesitation in sharing a pretty personal story, I gently push. The curiosity is overwhelming, but I was never sure if I wasn't trusted enough or that I'm revisiting an unpleasant place, so I'd drop it, showing interest in the topic randomly in the future "
4829,isfp,"Yeah! This really sums up my thoughts leading up to this post. No one is obligated to share with me, but I can't say that I don't expect something in return, though I feel like that's a selfish thought sometimes "
4830,isfp,"The first one is pretty accurate for me. When I discover something new and I really like it, I tend to listen to it for weeks and nothing else. Right now I've got several songs that I've become obsessed over the past week. "
4831,isfp,"It depends on my mood. If I find a song I really like I'm gonna listen to it until I hate it lol. If I'm in a non-specific mood for listening I'll throw on a playlist with a huge variety in genre. So, both."
4832,isfp,"I don't understand. I listen to a (very) wide variety of songs over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I have spotify since december and usually at morning I choose a playlist and listen to it for whole day. I don't have a lot of playlists, and I also have a playlist that is called ""Liked songs from radio"" which is basically a mix of songs from all my playlists."
4833,isfp,"I'm a school band/chorus/drama teacher. So, for me, listening to music cannot be mundane. I like to rotate through playlists during my morning workouts. I can't remember the last time I placed a song on repeat."
4834,isfp,"Both. I listen to the songs I like over and over and move on and explore other music. What I like to do is what I call ""rediscovering"" music. I remember old songs from my childhood and listen to those. The nostalgia factor is strong. I'm not really an album listener. I like listening to the artist's hits and maybe some remixes, covers, and acoustic covers. Or I skip to a certain part of a song and listen to just that part. "
4835,isfp,"I listen to the songs i like daily like 8 times (i always have like 5 - 15 of them) until i move on to other songs/artists/bands. I'm always searching for new songs tho. Music is my life, because i'm a musician myself."
4836,isfp,"Indeed I am the same way. I will stay listening one band and nothing else, and I will listen to a few songs from that band over and over. Till I finally find other songs I really like from that particular band. This band I speak of right now is Red"
4837,isfp,"I will second this.
I get obsessive at times. If I'm in the mood for something specific, I will listen to it OVER AND OVER. But then there are times that I either don't care or I want to listen to a hundred things at once, so I throw on a playlist that makes no real sense. It can jump from The A-Teens to Tool."
4838,isfp,"Hi all. ENFJ male here... I've gone on a few dates with a girl who told me she's an ISFP. She's great in so many ways, and we have tons of chemistry, and a lot in common. Things were going well until she flaked out on a date, and then sent me a follow-up text saying she's been needing to spend some time focusing on herself, but she still likes me and wants to see me again. I told her it's all good and to let me know when she wants to meet up.
I wasn't sure if she was letting me down easy, so I decided to leave the ball in her court, and leave it up to her to initiate another date. Since then, nearly two weeks ago, she's texted me cute things but hasn't initiated another date.
I'm not an idiot, and know that when someone bails without rescheduling, it's a bad sign, but this girl seems unique, which is why I'm not sure how to read this situation. I've read up on ISFPs and understand that you frequently need alone time, and that you're usually sincere when you communicate your feelings about people. 
I'd like to ask her out again, but I'm worried about scaring her away, or seeming inconsiderate if she's still wanting of alone time. Selfishly, I'd like to know where I stand with. If she's not into me, it'd be nice to know so I can move on."
4839,isfp,"(Please forgive me for posting so much, 
I hope I'm not annoying anyone.. I'd like to Post a poem for those who would care to read and tell me what they think? 
Thank you friends.)
------------------!-----------
All I can eat these days is smoke.
Water from the tap keeps dripping and I feel annoyed.
I wonder where you went. 
The day you left me behind.
You walked through the clouds as the sky fell apart like shattered glass. 
I stood below the waters watching as I always do. 
I never was one for action.
I find myself when it's too late.
Eyes like the sun looking down on me. 
I never could feel your warmth, despite my leather skin.
I bet you're laughing up there.
Poor baby bird thought a snake was his own mother.
Hallucinatory gaze melting away the chromosomes.
Is that even possible when love is abstract?
I should go back to sleep. 
It's the only escape. 
But please, never stop singing. 
Do that and I promise to stare into a mirror for eternity.
Or atleast until the stars are swallowed by the sea. 
I can settle for that."
4840,isfp,"What fancy said. I'd add that j/p switch happens only for introverted types due to socionics assigning j/p based on dominant function. Extraverted types keep their j/p's. So ISFP-

4842,isfp,"Everytime I read an ISFP descrpition it makes me feel like a retarded monkey who paints all day which I know I'm not cause I'm perfectly capable of logic and abstract thought even more so than some so called ""smart"" intuitives. 
Seems to me that ISFP doesn't get the recognition it deserves and is just taken for granted as some emotional artistic monkey"
4843,isfp,"My husband is an isfp. He‚Äôs the most unique person I know, and we were great friends for ten years before we even dated. Then bam! Soulmates and married. Together as a couple now 4years. He definitely had layers that took a long time to see through, and as a younger guy was just a little too immature in his emotions and perspectives, a little too impulsive. I mistook his argumentativeness/love of debate and stubborn refusal to follow advice as a selfishness and immaturity, and wondered why such an open minded guy could get stuck in his perspective. I had no idea that beneath that was someone who is very capable of understanding anything once he‚Äôs not afraid of being mocked/criticized, and is capable of following advice once he starts to see the proof in the pudding.
He is not an artist but a nurse and previously a medic in National Gaurd (decent at guitar but can‚Äôt sing, has eclectic taste in music). He‚Äôs also been a bouncer lol. Great at kinetic things like jiu jitsu, and sports. Very tactile and sensory, loves good food, nice sheets, always petting the dogs, exercises, comfortable clothes, aware of his body and things around us. (While I don‚Äôt notice my shirt on backwards and often walk into people).
He is empathetic, kind hearted and supportive. Fiercely loyal. Very individualistic but strives for harmony. Sometimes retreats into periods of hermitude if misunderstood or too much conflict. Rebellious in face of bullies or authoritarians that attempt to control others. Concerned for anyone who is upset, and takes initiative in trying to reassure or help. Hates to see anyone victimized, and defends others.
Has difficulty articulating his emotions well, and does take criticism harshly, even things that are not personal. When criticized he can shut down, divert topic, project, feign ignorance, become stubborn or retreat. He‚Äôs actually working on it though, and has grown more self-aware and identifies and handles his emotions much better. Doesn‚Äôt mentally spin as much, and starting to notice when he‚Äôs drawing inward or closing off. He‚Äôs also articulating his perspectives better and getting the bigger picture instead of being derailed by details. Acknowledging passive aggressiveness when it creeps up, and stating himself more directly/holding himself accountable. Sometimes he has difficulty understanding how others perceive things, or predicting how others would react, even though he accepts that everyone follows their own drum and supports it... he can be off mark when it comes to knowing what makes others tick.
He‚Äôs incredibly open minded, very liberal and identifies with anyone who lives life differently. Very alternative in his tastes and interests. He was raised by an INTJ and an INTP, so he does like philosophical debate, and politics, kind of bad at planning and strategy sometimes (might be the ADD lol). He has a lot of INTJ friends who enjoy competing with him, and he seems to lift them up when they go through down times with his positivity/humor/present mindedness. He easily makes friends, and has about 5 best friends he‚Äôs kept for over 20 years. I think it‚Äôs due to the fact that he is always himself so those who wouldn‚Äôt like him don‚Äôt bother and those who would like him are drawn to him. Regardless he often says he has social anxiety.
A very poor planner, and so has not achieved all that he wished, prone to feeling overwhelmed with tasks and goals and therefore procrastinates or avoids it, then will slump into inactivity and depression, but then sudden bursts of energy with an unrealistic plan that falls through... and gets him down again. Retreating into long sessions of video games, reading books, binge watching movies when he‚Äôs overwhelmed and avoiding. (Again addressing ADD has helped this, as well as using a calender, alarm reminders, and getting feedback on a plan of action)."
4844,isfp,"i completely agree. a lot of other type descriptions seem to me to be somewhat correct (as much as online descriptions can be..), but for isfp it's off by a lot in my opinion.. honestly if it weren't for researching on the functions i would doubt myself being an isfp based on descriptions alone "
4845,isfp,"This one is far more accurate than all the ones I've read on the internet and ironically it comes from just a normal user
https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5zr3jf/differentiating_infp_vs_isfp_masterpost/
ISFPs (negativist):
solve problems in systems of things and processes
""This glass is half-empty""; ""We need $62,000 for that project.""
usually more reprimanding than complimenting (this is usually a mostly or entirely internal process in introverts - ISFPs give compliments a lot)
socially and intellectually more mistrusting
explain how things shouldn't be"
4846,isfp,"Will read it. The only good one so far I've came across is this one
https://www.stellarmaze.com/isfp-bullies-or-the-bullied-or-both/
I feel like every ISFP description is about women ISFP which is rather different."
4847,isfp,"I have been reading posts about ISFPs in the last few days(kind of at a weird point in life and like hearing how other ISFPs go about stuff, I find it helpful) and have read on a few threads that  say ISFP's are known for having more bold or interesting fashion choices. I can definitely relate to that, fashion feels kind of like painting in a way or something and I just find it really fun
I used to wear pretty muted, minimal stuff in various colors. usually just tried to have some contrast and made sure stuff fit. now I am really into more 
'relaxed' clothing and prints/designs, lately have been really into shirts from places like Club Monaco that have more of a summery feel and unique patterns. also wearing a lot of shorts lately, usually go for something a few inches above the knee and in a fabric like cotton or linen. I'm having a hard time finding good summer pants, but regular cotton chinos are fine and I wear those a lot. during the colder months I basically wear the same stuff, just long sleeved shirts and don't wear shorts much. for shoes I like leather/suede boots a lot, but when I wear shorts I usually go with more minimal sneakers(like converse, white leather sneakers) or new balance(the designs definitely grew on me and the comfort is great) if the rest of the outfit is more plain
I don't know if I'd say my fashion sense is super bold, but sometimes it can be different. it's fun to wear more unusual stuff like light pink pants and interesting prints rather than going for more normal colors and designs. at the same time though i still appreciate minimalism and like wearing very simple stuff too, depends what I'm doing I guess. especially at home or the gym I'm usually just wearing t-shirts or tank tops and sweatpants/shorts or something, but I usually try to keep the color coordination in order(unless my clothes are all dirty, then I'll just wear whatever's clean). 
Just curious what other people like to wear and what they think about fashion in general. I'll be honest growing up I just wore whatever, then a few years ago I decided I should start wearing stuff I like and have found it really fun since then. I would love to design my own stuff at some point"
4848,isfp,"My sense of style is very unusual, I like ordinary, and I have outfits that allow this for particular work events, but I like more unusual fashion. I work in a charity shop (thrift store in the US I believe) as a manager, so I get a lot of stuff that is unique in! I tend to love patterned trousers, I like skinny jeans which I‚Äôll wear with patterned t shirts or shirts, or even jumpers, and I have a tendency to buy jumpers if zips are in really unusual places (I don‚Äôt see these very often at all), as for my shoes, I never buy black work shoes, I have to be different lol, I have brown leather boots, and various pairs of shoes and this just keeps growing!
I totally agree with what you say though, my fashion sense is where I paint myself and draw out, but that‚Äôs where also working in a charity store can be so liberating. I never know what we‚Äôre going to get in, so I never actually know what I‚Äôm going to get for my wardrobe next!"
4849,isfp,"I have a range, from grungey to smart casual to streetstyle. All of them always in colours that go really well together, not usually bright but more earthy or muted or neutral, proportionally appealing and balanced, always consider which textures and prints and necklines etc go together, with jewellery that is either statement or very delicate but not cliche. If I do makeup it'll only be focused on the eyes or the lips, not usually both unless it's evening, but it'll still look very casual and almost half-done, like ""I woke up like this""
Yeah I always look really good and I know it :D I love fashion"
4850,isfp,"like . soft dumpster diver. blocky silhouette that shows off my back, but with one of those neck scrunchy things so it's less severe.  
I'm dreading summer - I never know what to wear. maybe a linen stand collar type shirt, with shorts/chinos, and some kind of loafer or birkenstock ordeal. ugh. or get some vivos and just go athleisure. or preppy rugby shirt/smart shorts/boat shoe/fuck my wallet walnut belt. (I don't have the hair for any of these looks) (guide me, idris elba) 
but I also like a kind of soft minimalism. this | sort | of thing) that reminds me of early 20thC romanian artisans.  
I like the sort of practical country style - monty don, wendell berry. though monty don prolly spends more on one pair of boots than i'll spend on all my clothes in my lifetime. (he's the cutest i can't take it)  
I don't know what to do with this information. I have a lot of cognitive dissonance/conflicting ideas about style/expression. hate shopping. it would be convenient to get filthy rich and pay someone to unleash my inner goldblum."
4851,isfp,"I have none!  I always feel dated, but don‚Äôt typically care.  If only the artsy side of could do fashion. I love fashion and have seen things that I would really like to wear but two things happen. 

I get the feeling I would never look good in it, even when I love the way it looks.
If someone else is already doing it, I don‚Äôt want to because it‚Äôs been done.
"
4852,isfp,"Flowery or nature/animal inspired button up shirts with a soft quality like rayon. Chino pants, cargo pants, or jeans to match whatever color shirt. I love bright colors. You cant catch me wearing tops like grey, black, navy blue, purple, or orange."
4853,isfp,"I'm in love with earth tones. I also love having more of an outdoorsy style. Overall, however, I just want my clothes to be secondhand. As much fun as I have looking through Target's clothing section, I don't feel ethically right buying new clothes, haha."
4854,isfp,"Bright colors, shorts, jeans, t-shirts, mismatched socks, lots of badges and patches... If I'm actually dressing to go out I enjoy wearing things that make me feel cute and quirky and express a little of my interests and personality.
...90% of the time I am wearing pajamas though XD but those can be cute as well!"
4855,isfp,"I like to dress classy, feminine, and kinda sporty? I love dresses with short 1 inch heels (I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and flat footed, bigger heels don‚Äôt work with me), pencil skirts, blouses, etc. I have a gucci trenchcoat that I love to wear. It turns quite a few heads whenever I wear it! 
I also really like windbreakers and I have a nike windbreaker from 1978 or so.. it was my mom‚Äôs. When I am at home I wear comfortable clothes, but when I go out I dress as what I described above. I also have a couple of patriotic shirts I wear out every now and then."
4856,isfp,"I have never been one to wear a lot of black for some reason, though recently I've gotten more stuff in black and like going monochrome sometimes
why?"
4857,isfp,"that sounds fun, I used to work at a clothing store too and got a lot of nice stuff there for free or on a big discount. I need to find a good thrift store nearby, there used to be some great ones where I lived last year but I'm not sure how they are here. definitely worth it for the savings and you can find some unique stuff in them
yeah that's a good way of putting it - painting yourself"
4858,isfp,"earthy colors are really nice - go with almost anything and also work really well together. 
very important stuff to consider for sure. I was just looking at a shirt and  really liked the print and color, except that zooming in the linework was a little wavy/crooked and in my opinion didn't really match the rest of the shirt. or at least not what I would do personally. might still get it if it goes on sale though :P"
4859,isfp,"this all definitely resonates with me:) I love your examples of soft minimalism(not really into oversized sweaters though). I was looking at the store Massimo Dutti yesterday and it kind of reminds me of that, at least their photography/model work is cool and different than most stores. 
for summer just go overboard with linen - it's so comfortable and really works well with that sort of style. I have to get some linen pants myself, but haven't seen anything great yet. yesterday I ordered some cotton/linen pants from uniqlo, but I don't know if I'll like them. birkenstocks are cool too, I kind of want to get a pair of bostons but I have like 12 pairs of shoes and only wear 4-5"
4860,isfp,"those are fair points, but I feel like most people can pull off more than they think they can. when I worked at a clothing store I always suggested stuff and people would say they couldn't pull it off, and if I convinced them to try it it usually worked for them- just needed the right pants/shoes or whatever. that sort of goes with point 2 as well, stuff is done by other people but the combinations of different clothes are what can make your outfits unique
though in the end fashion is about what you're comfortable wearing:) and there are a lot of styles I like that I'll never be able to wear because of my build(that I don't want to change) but I still appreciate them"
4861,isfp,"yeah I feel that. I see so much nice stuff but it's probably made by people who aren't being paid or treated ethically, so it feels bad buying it. I want to move to only buying stuff ethically but it can be hard to do that. buying stuff second hand is a good idea too."
4862,isfp,"Ahh I idon't know much about specific brands/designers (though who can deny the erotic power of '80s Armani menswear?), but i looked up that massimo dutti and it all looks so lovely. they have a good sense of combining textures in subtle and effective ways. i'm in the uk, tho, where the light's shite, and elegance and understatement can easily get lost.  
I've got some linen, but I feel so naked in it! when i'm out, i'm out walking the dog, so practicality comes first. it's tricky. good luck with the new pants, and get the shoes. shoes wear out, you'll need shoes ;)"
4863,isfp,"I'm trying to figure out if this is just me or maybe a part of my personality that others share. 
I'll find a group with some common ground or interest and become fairly acquainted with everyone. After a while with the group, I start to feel restless. I'll become bored or tired of what people are saying. I'd want to do something new, but I'll feel stuck within the interests and ideas of the group. So then I'll try and find a new group, drift over seamlessly and repeat the process all over again. This happens all the time.
I never become close to a group of people and I feel like my interests change a lot because I always want to do something new to me. Is this just me or do you guys ever feel the same way?"
4864,isfp,"Yeah, I've never been a part of a social clique. A lot of my friends are from different walks of life and have different friends and different interests. I just have friends, not a friend group, which is how I like it. I'll talk to and hang out with whomever I feel is good for me or a fun time."
4865,isfp,"I too am a subculture/group drifter. No matter how well I intend to embrace what they're all about, I just can't make myself fit in and then it leads to me just getting bored/frustrated and moving on. I just hang out with individuals who I like and it doesn't matter what their scene is. "
4866,isfp,"I know your feeling , many of my friends are from childhood and have very diffrent personalities from introverts to extroverts which suits me well. Then I can hang out with who I want to depening on my mood etc. and you get a good mix of intrest "
4867,isfp,"Yep, I just broke up with a friend because she got really annoying to me. I think this is partially because I have been known to do this with people I spend a lot of time with/she was incredibly frustrating."
4868,isfp,I'm partially esfp (with borderline personality) so my experiences may be skewed. I find myself very dependant on attention and affection from my friends. Most of them are NTs. I also find myself growing up and disagreeing with the way they think. They tend to say anti Semitic or sexist things and i stay quiet because i don't want to instigate a fight.
4869,isfp,"I've recently just gotten friendzoned by someone who I thought I could be with, and I haven't had any interest like that my entire life, up until now. I almost feel like there is no one around my area who I could like in such a way... So other ISFPs, do you find it difficult to find a romantic partner?"
4870,isfp,"Yes, very difficult. Reflecting back, even the people I got into a relationship with I felt lacked a certain something..there was something missing in the connection. But I think ISFPs have the problem of wanting to be so deeply connected with someone (the way we are with ourselves) that no one will ever be able to meet this expectation.
I frequently have crushes on people that would never date me seriously, and when I think if they would - it wouldn't last. Something would be missing. It's kind of sad, sometimes I feel like I will end up alone."
4871,isfp,"I feel like it is. I just don't connect to people in that sense even if I have a physical attraction but seems there's something missing. It has only happened once for me and I'm 42 M...  
I never really thought about it until this post... time to over-think. "
4872,isfp,"Never had problems dating or getting in relationships. The biggest problem was to have my introversion accepted. No one was able to understand my need for (wibbly-wobbly) time and space and everyone accused me of not loving them cause i wasn't clingy. Damn Fi.
I solved finding an intj lol."
4873,isfp,I'm going to jump in on this hopefully not too late. INFJ male who has had a serious long-term relationship with an ISFP female. I found that she was unable or unwilling to share deep emotions. Also I found that I was the more communicative person in our relationship as well as the more emotionally expressive. It does seem as though the introverted feelings do make it more difficult for ISFP to let go to open one self up to the significant other. There was history of relationship failure starting to build up within her life. It's really hard for me to describe all this because it hurts still even after 8 years. I tried my hardest to connect with her. I think she is ok making initial connection but it's the long term part she had difficulty with. Do ISFPs have difficulty persevering in relationships? 
4874,isfp,"For male ISFPs especially. You have the best shot with Te types like ENTJ, INTJ, INTJ, and ESTJ who value your dominant Fi: ISFP type matches"
4875,isfp,"I guess? Never been in the limelight. My professors barely even remember my face even if I'm always present in their class. Making meaningful attachments has been hard too, and tbh if my intp boyfriend hadn't had a drunk that night and drunkenly confessed to me I wonder where I would be now. Prolly still single."
4876,isfp,"Glad to know I'm not the only one like this. I see what you mean. The kind of relationship i want is like finding a needle in a haystack. It's near nonexistent. I'm now only realizing what it's like to be truly alone. Yes I have friends and family, but there's just one person I want more than them, and it makes me feel more lonely than I've ever felt before. "
4877,isfp,This! I totally agree with this and glad Im not alone. I have dated so many people and have had this problem with each guy. I kind of focus on my career to prevent having nothing to look forward to but I would like someone and I would hope there's that connection for me out there. But having an interesting career helps me just in case it never happens. I feel embarrassed about how many people I've dated and not found that connection! 
4878,isfp,Trust in that your idealization of this person is making you think you want them and need them. If you had them you would feel differently. I am trying to focus on myself and spirituality to find out what my needs are and how to fulfill them internally.
4879,isfp,"It‚Äôs always an amazing feeling to experience romantic feelings for someone, but then the anxiety sets in where you don‚Äôt know if they return the affection. In my case with numerous people I developed feelings for not returning that sentiment and getting into relationships that didn‚Äôt last long, it‚Äôs mostly just the anxiety and excessive need to have somebody at that level of closeness. "
4880,isfp,"That‚Äôs a good plan. Little pro-tip though, from one ISFP to another: try NOT to romanticize someone you‚Äôre pining for. If they don‚Äôt return the sentiment, romanticizing them is just gonna make it harder to move on."
4881,isfp,"Kinda learned that the hard way... i definitely romanticized the last person i tried it with. Right now, I've managed to stick with being friends with her. I try not to think about my feelings around her, which i'm still slowing getting past. Trying to wait for someone to eventually come around, and the less i think about that happening, the faster it'll come around. Being stuck on that though makes the days seem much slower and makes me feel very lonely. "
4882,isfp,"That describes my predicament to a ‚ÄúT‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs a natural thing for ISFPs to romanticize those they fall for; it kind of plays into the active imagination area of their personalities. I did that with both people I tried to be with and it just ruined how I‚Äôve gotten over them. Work does help take my mind off things and gaming helps, but those people I‚Äôve opened myself to tend to come back to mind a lot and it just strengthens the loneliness."
4883,isfp,describing my feelings much? The ones you open up to always come back often. It hurts when the though comes up and you know they don't feel the same way. 
4884,isfp,"It‚Äôs definitely tough, Especially when those people shut you down on good terms. I can guarantee I think about those people at least once a day with a heavy heart.. I‚Äôd almost rather those relationships ended on bad terms just cause it‚Äôs easy for me to move on from people who hurt me intentionally. "

4886,isfp,"Im bilingual and currently learning a third language. I feel like i am particularly good at learning a language. Just curious if that‚Äôs an isfp thing.
Side thought - in general i am not good at conveying my thoughts into words (typical isfp thing), so it carries into my sub languages as well. For instance, i may know and understand perfectly in my head in the language, but it may seem like i dont know the language as well as i do because i dont speak it out.
But anyways, are my fellow isfps good at language?
Also, do you find this trait attractive in others? Like if they are multilingual "
4887,isfp,"I learned my native language very early (age 3 -ish) plus Russian. I knew English and some Japanese (through internet and anime) by age 13 and started helping with some translations in my teen years. I don't know how much it is because of young age, but yeah, I think I do learn languages very easily. I think our Se especially can assist us in gathering new objective information and assimilating it very quickly. Don't know about memory or retaining information, that might be more difficult for us (lol)"
4888,isfp,I feel the same way as you. English is my fourth language and I had an easier time picking it up compared to my brother (when we moved to NA). I was also able to erase my accent much quicker than him. 
4889,isfp,"I learnt English by myself, and I've always had a great level in my native language. I just love those things. I learn bits of languages here and there, ~~often profanity~~, but I'd like to learn more languages, so I can express myself in plenty of ways."
4890,isfp,"I'm pretty good at learning languages, if you factor out my difficulty in committing to regular practice. I have a much harder time with written language than spoken though. I can be trying and trying to remember the conjugation for a word and then immediately know it upon speaking the sentence out loud in French, for example. And with Chinese, which I've just started learning, I find the tones to be very easy so far, while the characters are just an absolute ball of confusion to me."
4891,isfp,"I just went to a USA screening for this. I believe it's only showing in Canada right now, but I'm too ISFP to look up all the facts. 
All I know is you should find a way, legal or illegal, to watch this. Because Mason, the main character is the most ISFP man I have ever seen on screen and I wanted to explode. Except I stayed in my seat and died a little, silently, as per usual. 
This is the trailer: http://youtu.be/Y0oX0xiwOv8
It was a movie made over the course of 12 years. It's such an S movie because it's literally about nothing other than life. No CGI or tricks or special effects, not even any fake drama that's reserved for movies only. It's perfect. 
Go see it. "
4892,isfp,"I saw it by accident (I was intrigued by the trailer and went to a film festival at my college that it just happened to be playing at on that night.)
It was so incredible, I loved everything about it. I felt I could relate with the main character at a ridiculous level."
4893,isfp,"It's also very possible his character was very easy to connect with :) 
I guess the ISFP traits I saw most were his sort of daydreaminess while also being down to earth and practical. He didn't have really wild ideas, but surmised about what's happening in the now. He never seemed to think about the future much. Sort of a hippie, liked to incorporate his chosen form of expression into his clothing (paint on the clothes) which seems like an ISFP thing to do. 
Also he didn't care what other people thought of him which really rang true of an ISFP as his clothes didn't always suit him but they instead suited his personality. He was very independent but also relied on the actions of others to come together to create a perfect world in his mind but never pushed that. No desire to control or be controlled. Just very ""here I am, take it or leave it."" Showed affection in small doses, making him come across as aloof. Didn't fully appreciate words, picky about who he opens up to...
I could go on. I'm not arguing with you. Just kinda felt like listing these so it's here on this post. "
4894,isfp,"Yeah he is probably very easy to connect with for most introverts. Our two types must be pretty similar too because a lot of what you said, I strongly relate to. I think being picky about who you open up to is also an INTP thing, along with not caring about what others think.
The thing about him that I most strongly related to was just his dispostion and his subtle facial expressions "

4896,isfp,"I am sorry if this sounds beyond obvious, but I just came to the realization that extroverts too have problems in enviroments dominated by introverts.
For example, my home environment is introvert dominated, in which my mom is the only extrovert - and just yesterday I noted that how much bad time she gets just because she wants to hangout/talk more with us and other friends in comparison to us.
Just sharing - can't imagine what kind of replies I am going to get for this one :-P"
4897,isfp,"I'm an extrovert kid with an introvert older sister and introvert parents. This conversation actually happened once:
Me: I was thinking of going out to a concert with my friends this weekend
Mom: Don't you see them everyday at school? 
Me:Yea so? 
Sister: Well hang out with them than, it's way more efficient 
Dad: Also that way you can enjoy the weekend all for yourself "
4898,isfp,"Yea but I had to pay it by myself and didn't have going out privileges for the next 2 weeks. It was worth it doe. 
A bit later I'm gonna ask them if I can go to another one,combined with a sleepover after it(no way I'm gonna be sober enough to come home) wish me luck. "
4899,isfp,"I really like this girl but I'm not really sure if she likes me back because she doesn't text very much. She might say a few things if she's excited about something, but then not respond to my reply. Or she might invite me something and I would say that I'm looking forward to it, but she wouldn't respond at all (we still go but she didn't respond to my text).
Does it sound like she's not interested?"
4900,isfp,"Ok but also I‚Äôve realized being an ISFP I‚Äôm so reliant on my senses that if someone isn‚Äôt right in front of me and I can feel their emotions and that they enjoy me then I don‚Äôt remember if they do or not. 
If she seems like she enjoys your company when you‚Äôre in person she probably does. Don‚Äôt doubt yourself too much! And don‚Äôt judge someone by their texting. I‚Äôve made that mistake wayyy to many times."
4901,isfp,"Keep initiating, my current bf reached out to me a ton after I first met him. I didn‚Äôt reply a lot as I was honestly just distracted with other things and don‚Äôt love texting anyways. How it worked out is he was so respectful, I could tell he was serious about wanting to get to know each other in person. He initiated everything about the first date from picking me up, choosing a restaurant and letting me decide on a movie at the theatre!! It was incredibly attractive it made it clear how much a guy cared for me"
4902,isfp,"Hi there , 
This may sound weird , but I feel the need to write this here, because I am confused and I feel like I don't know myself anymore..
I've discovered that I am an ISFP , and also I was diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder. These two are completely opposite. I am 24 years old and I have no friends , or good job . Sometimes I feel my antisocial side , I feel lack of empathy for others and I absolutely hate following orders, but I am trying to control this dark side of mine. I feel like I am in conflict with myself because of my antisocial tendencies , I don't want to be a bad person.
Someone else here with antisocial tendencies ? How do you handle that ? Thanks"
4903,isfp,"The I from ISFP is from Introverted, i wouldn't say beeing antisocial is completly opposite from beeing ISFP.  
Empathy can be practiced , and there is no need to be wondering a lot if you are anti social or who are you or how you should be in my opinion.
MBTI is fun cool and useful but i think one dosen't have to think it's an accuarate description of reality, people are complex, you can't describe someone just as ""ISFP"""
4904,isfp,"Hey, sifir, just a quick heads-up:
completly is actually spelled completely. You can remember it by ends with -ely.
Have a nice day!

4905,isfp,"hey, that's cool!
so this might help, just an idea... you don't have to take it
‚Äã
I've been practicing meditation from some time now and i think it really works, i don't usually try to talk people into this but in this case i think metta meditation seems to be the thing you might be needing.  
Metta meditation or loving kindness meditation makes your empathy grow in a really strong way, at least it worked for me, i used to really hate my dad (i even had fantasies of killing him) and i started practicing metta meditation and now after a year or so i really get along with him, we spend a lot of time together and we have some good laughs. You have to put it in work but i really think it works.
This is a guide for practicing it: https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-practice-loving-kindness-meditation-3144786 
Don't feel obligated to do this, is just an idea.
May you be happy and well!  :)"
4906,isfp,"DAE find themselves zoning out for a while visualizing possible scenarios with different people? Like how things would play out with your bf if you rearranged the furniture? Or what could have happened if you had transferred to a different store? I feel like I spend a ridiculous amount of time imagining how conversations are gonna go. Sometimes it would be cool if it was a movie, I end up in some pretty random places.   "
4907,isfp,Sometimes I think of funny ‚Äúmovies‚Äù and laugh out loud seemingly at nothing - so often that the people I‚Äôm around are used to it cause I‚Äôve had to say ‚Äúoh I just thought of something funny‚Äù ....but it‚Äôs so far in a rabbit hole that I cant explain it lol

Second best thing would be my 2nd grade kiss.
Third would be meeting a Border Collie that was oh so lovely and beautiful. "
4910,isfp,"Failing the seventh grade.
I was fucking miserable in middle school. Depressed. Had no real friends. Got bullied fucking constantly. Ended up rebelling, and as a result was held back. Which made me think my life was over. I had the only suicidal thoughts I have ever had that summer.
First day of my second attempt at seventh grade I met my best friend. Went on to make more friends. Gained confidence that I wasn't a piece of trash. Stopped being bullied. Started making straight A's. Wasn't popular, but had friends in every clique. Everything changed.
I still don't understand it. No one mocked me for failing. No one even brought it up. My family didn't even seem to care. It was like everyone just overlooked it. I don't know what else to do but thank God. Divine intervention is the only way I can rationalize it to myself. Honestly. I think I was saved. Either that, or I went through with the suicide and this is heaven."
4911,isfp,"Being in high school, hating life, playing video games everyday for countless hours, being lonely, depressed, socially awkward, and overweight...
Then one day I was tired of it so I made a change, got a job. After that my life wasn‚Äôt just getting fat and playing video games. I started exercising, my confidence skyrocketed, I got a girlfriend...
The shitty years in high school is the best thing to happen to me yet, and to anyone just starting high school or anyone fed up with it don‚Äôt give up and try too learn from EVERYTHING that happens. 
Im 18, just graduated and I‚Äôm moving into the next big developmental phase of my life a different person than I was a year ago!"
4912,isfp,"I been wondering what do you guys do on your free time? I usually sleeps, be on my phone (check out apps) and listening to music. And if i had a ps4 i would play video games. I also likes spending time with friends. 
Also a question, are ISFPs known for begin lazy?  Cause i am. Thank you for taking time reading all this."
4913,isfp,"I would that ISFP only come of as being lazy when we don't have anything to work for, at least that would applie to me. 
Like to go on walks, listen to music, workout and play games from time to time."
4914,isfp,"I CAN be very lazy... but if I'm motivated by a project I'm working on, I can also be very intense and focused on finishing.   I like being outside, doing yard work, going for walks.  But, i also love internetting, listening to podcasts, watching tv shows.  So yeah, generally fairly lazy. lol."
4915,isfp,"I mostly just work out, go to work, listen to music and draw. I used to play video games, but I just do every once in a while now. they take up too much time and I usually lose interest in them quickly. I find that working out is a good replacement too
I agree with the other comment, if we have something to work towards we can be pretty diligent but it depends how into it we are and how much that thing means to us- at least in my own personal experience. working out for me hasn't had much meaning for the last year or so since I've been in a comfortable spot, but I want to step it up and get in really good shape so I can potentially do physically demanding jobs. still thinking about what my plan will be. but I find that if I have one, it's not hard to divert most of my attention towards achieving those goals
same thing with art projects- if it's something I really enjoy working on and want to finish then it's not very hard to get the motivation to do it. but some projects just go on forever and either never get finished or come out somewhat half-assed, just so I can say that they're finished."
4916,isfp,Usually I‚Äôm working as an esthetician or I‚Äôm out and about with my sisters ( they my only friends lol ) when I‚Äôm at home I‚Äôm usually Practicing something I‚Äôm learning how to do or I‚Äôm usually studying and watching tv . I‚Äôm not lazy I do procrastinate but I make sure I get it done that day !
4917,isfp,"When I am in a bad mood I project it. I see myself doing it too. Which makes me feel even worse. Which makes me keep doing it. Its a fucking endless spiral.
I constantly flake at the last fucking second. Its because I never wanted to go, and when it finally comes time I just admit to myself I will be happier not going. People don't invite me out as much as they used to as a result. Which is fair.
I am very dangerous and irrational when you piss me off. Dangerous in the sense that I don't even know what I am fully capable of. I am not someone you wanna cross. I purposefully become as big of a cunt as humanly possible. I will lose a war to win a battle. I am not too timid to resort to physical violence. I will make damn sure you don't want to cross me again."
4918,isfp,"I am territorial about the things that I like and don‚Äôt like being friends with people who infringe on my sense of individuality (which is childish and unreasonable) or people who devalue my interests. 
I prioritize self preservation over others‚Äô emotions almost every time. 
I can be so non confrontational that instead of being upfront about issues i‚Äôm having with people, I let negative feelings and resentments bottle up and fester until I‚Äôm fed up. I am guilty of ghosting/door slamming people without even a warning sign which is unfair to them considering they didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to explain their perspective. "
4919,isfp,"If someone does something like interrupt or talk over me (multiple times), mansplain, or say something really offensive about a group of people, I basically stop acknowledging them. Instead of working past it and staying on civil terms or telling them why I don‚Äôt like what they did. (Cuz I don‚Äôt like that kind of conflict.) 
It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt have to interact with them, but they‚Äôre in my work cell at work and currently is sleeping in my living room so it gets AWKWARD in those situations. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
4920,isfp,"I tend to talk about myself. A LOT. Because I'm very introspective and constantly try to figure out my place in the scheme of things. I'm incredibly self-centered.
I'm a bit embarrassed to say it but I'm not overly interested in other people's lives. I care about them, but I don't want to know their life details.
I'm emotionally unstable (but it has more to do with BPD and possible bipolar than being an ISFP, I reckon)
At some point, I just disappear and ignore people. Not with everyone, but sometimes I have friends and one day, everything they do or says irks me for a reason I don't even know. It makes me feel bad but I can't ever bring myself to come back.
I am either super altruistic or selfish to the point of ""if you die, I don't even give a shit""."
4921,isfp,"I'm constantly late to everywhere I go. Some days I force it so I run so late, I end up pissing off the people who are waiting for me to arrive so much that they say forget it and I get to stay home. I have an unhealthy relationship with my anger. Usually, I can hold back but that just leads to build up until I eventually explode. I hate mess but find ways to avoid it instead of addressing the mess. Every time I get into a new relationship, I immediately don't want to be in a relationship.

4922,isfp,"when someone pisses me off and wrongs me if i don't express that im pissed of at someone and am alone. i use my demon function which is TI and just start going ham on thinking how i can take them down.

Everyone is expected to be part of a group or movement and if you're not interested then somehow you are meant to be part of the problem. I'm an individual human being and I find ideologies toxic. Conversely, that makes me come across as toxic."
4924,isfp,"ISFPs do the same thing.

but when they hurt you enough and cause enough damage to you then you might relapse and reconsider.  If they Trigger your FI then you might change your mind.
it happens when you hate someones guts your FI just feels that way and your TI is the one trying to make things happen.

4925,isfp,"Fair warning, this ended up being a very long, unnecessary post, and I'm also on my phone, so I apologize for any formatting or spelling errors, I'll try to make this into paragraphs as best I can. I'm also not very good with reddit, I mainly read, not post, so bear with me.
I figured I might want to put a trigger warning, if you are sensitive to mentions of violence, depression, or other things to do with mental health, heads up. I don't go into any kind of explicit detail, but it does very briefly get brought up.
Hi guys! What do you all do for self care, stress relief, relaxation, ect? Back when I was a kid (less than 11 years old), I was outdoors in the woods, usually barefoot, all day every day. I climbed trees, explored, all sorts of stuff. I had a trampoline I loved. We had a massive veggie garden I would help tend to, pick veggies, ect. When I was inside, I constantly read books. I started reading Harry Potter, and finished book 6 before I turned 11. I was always creating something, drawing something, painting, coloring, you name it.
A lot of this, however, was to escape the violence in the household I grew up in. However, at least when I was very young, it was simply an integral part of my being. We miles outside of a small town of less than 900 people, ""in the sticks"". After my mom and stepdad divorced, mom and I moves into said small town, and let's just say wandering town streets and being around so many people just wasn't as interesting as wandering the woods from literally sun up to sun down. I became a house plant. 
I got a gameboy one year, and that was my introduction to the old Pokemon games (Leaf Green!). Several more years, and a few more moves in the same town, and I was still a house plant. I tried a weight lifting class, and track and field and volley ball, however due to issues with my knees and shoulders dislocating easily, I had to stop, and became a permanent couch potato after that.
I eventually became extremely depressed, due to various other traumatic life events as well, and after years of antidepressants, anxiety meds, and generally not caring, I gained a lot of weight. I believe initially I gained about 40 to 60 pounds in less than two years in high school. I was still very artsy and creative, excelling in my arts, English and science classes. Over time, life has drained all of the spark out of me. 
It's been 5 or 6 years since I graduated high school. Since my freshman year of high school, nearly ten years ago, I've put on probably close to 100 pounds. I can't get my sparkle back. I don't see the point of drawing, or painting, or making things anymore. It serves no functional purpose, so there's no point. I miss being active and feeling my body move and work for me. I miss getting so absorbed into fantasy books about other worlds, but I don't see the point any longer. What I miss the most however, is nature. I've been on a few hikes in the last few years, even tried to pick up running a few times, but nature just doesn't have that child-like wonder and beauty any more. I no longer feel that passion and excitement. 
All my life consists of (especially the past 6 months after having 2 knee surgeries to help fix injuries from those dislocations) is a couch or chair, Netflix and some random video games. Or scrolling on my phone, reading about others' adventures. I want to travel, I want to see things, see different people, different cultures, different worlds, try different food, learn how to create again, how to live again. I plan on looking into therapy here soon, as I know I probably sound pretty depressed. I've been in and out of therapy and on and off medications for depression, anxiety, Self harm, and suicidal thoughts and actions since I was 8, so This is not new to me, but it is tiring.
This ended up quite a long post, but can any of you relate? What do you guys do for fun? Does such a thing even exist anymore? "
4926,isfp,"Nihilism is dangerous. You need to care more about the world around you and take responsibility, set a goal, work for that. Humans need these things. 
Of course this will bring high and lows in your life. But... do you prefer a rollercoaster or a 10h long, linear car ride?
You can't enjoy free time if all you have is free time. You can't enjoy work time if all you do is working... now that you don't go to school, all you have is free time. That's why you enjoyed things as little, there were rewards, breaks, adventure... in exchange of school work and family problems.
It's hard coming out the nihilism loop. But it's all worth it. You can LIVE. Not just survive."
4927,isfp,"If your body feels up to it or after you heal up a bit more, could you take a trip somewhere and cross something off your bucket list? 
I was in a slump of nihilism and I broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year and took a solo trip to the Grand Canyon. I hiked that bad boy from rim to river and back in one day by myself. It was something I‚Äôve always wanted to do and it really helped boost me into feeling more control over my happiness and my life. Joy and wonder still don‚Äôt come as easily as they used to but it really reminded me how awesome I can be and all the awesome things I can do and see and it helped me set goals, which I am now working towards. 
I‚Äôm not saying you have to break up with your partner or go anywhere extravagant or really far away. Maybe a trip somewhere close by to see something or do something you‚Äôve never done will remind you how cool and novel the world is and it might encourage you to keeping finding your place in it? 
This is what worked for me. Like you, I had identified what was making me unhappy and things I wanted to change and doing something really hard that I‚Äôve always wanted to do encouraged me to keep going and changing my life into something I‚Äôm  more happy with. 
Also the planning of it all was really enjoyable. It was like a short term goal that I had to work out and it was great practice for starting to work out long term goals.
I hope you figure it all out. I think that emptiness and nihilistic feeling is the worst. It‚Äôs like a dull ache that isn‚Äôt painful enough to put you into an urgent crisis fixing mode. It just slowly drains you and is so exhausting and dissatisfying and you end up just finding ways to cope, rather than change it. I think ISFPs are special and strong and you seem to have a good understanding of yourself and situation so I‚Äôm sure you can and will  overcome this dark time and find your spark again. "
4928,isfp,"I can relate and I too rarely do something that is fun anymore. I was also a pretty life embracing kid until it was crushed over the years by family and school and now the same stuff is happening with lots of time spent at home and doing therapy and taking meds. What helped me a lot was EMDR. Since one particular session I finally found some connection to that inner pain and am able to act and do self care, meaning even basic things like eating and exercising a bit. The anxiety dropped comfortably low and even if I spent weeks at home I don't experience anxiety as much as I used to. Still taking meds tho but they never worked THAT good. I also joined a meditation discord server which  reminds me to be mindful and take my needs more seriously. The thing with having fun though is a different story. The meds lowered that even more than it was before and is now barely existing. Can have some fun with friends and alcohol but that is rare. I do believe though that I'm on a good path and my therapist is a very good one and I really see progress here and try to get my life on track. 
I wish you all the best, my friend and hope you find the best treatment you need."
4929,isfp,"You had an interest in art at one point, right? Maybe easing back into these old hobbies will help you rediscover/re-experience what you loved about them in the first place. If I can make a suggestion.. make tiny daily sketches and share them on Instagram... There's a thriving art community there which may help. Just remember to include lots of hashtags so your work is discovered :) best wishes!"
4930,isfp,"Thank you. I forgot to mention a few details in my ramblings. I graduated high school early and moved out on my own at 17, and have been on my own ever since, had my own apartment by myself for a few years, and met my current boyfriend of four years and have had an amazing, healthy relationship pretty much the whole time. The whole ""nihilism"" thing has been a cloud hanging over me since I was a young child, but it has finally taken the last creative sparkle out of me as I grew into adulthood and general adulting and responsibilities take over your day to day life. I'm thinking about finding an art class or something, but I still struggle with the whole ""there's no point"" aspect of it."
4931,isfp,"Thank you for sharing your story! I've kind of always wanted to do something like this, like a trip somewhere neat and going and experiencing it, preferably mostly outdoors like a nice hike. When I was 12, my ex-step dad was driving a semi and offered to take me along on a two week trip. It wasn't particularly glamorous, as we had to be on the road most of the time, but I was able to look out the window at 5 different states, and we did stop at the Great Crater in Arizona, the Grand Canyon, and the Redwood National Forrest in northern California, plus a few other small places, and it was honestly just about the best time in my life. One of the few memories I have that I can genuinely look back happily on. My partner has never been to these places and I would love nothing more than to road trip out there with him and experience it all again with him, but we always manage to come up with excuses, one of which, though valid, is income, haha. Hopefully we can change that here soon, because he is dying to go on this kind of trip as well."
4932,isfp,"So I‚Äôve been talking/kind of seeing (only seen him about 5-6 times) this guy since the beginning of December. I have never been able to tell if he‚Äôs actually interested in me or not! When we are together he‚Äôs warm, friendly, easy to be around, enjoys being all close and cuddly but then after I see him he seems to get all distant and won‚Äôt really try to talk to me much. After a few days (it was a few weeks at one point)  he‚Äôll slowly start talking to me again. I mainly try to just give him space and wait for him to come around,  and not freak out on the inside. 
Tonight he sent me a Snapchat of him playing a song on the ukulele which was super unexpected (as we haven‚Äôt talked much over the last two days) and it just made me feel so warm inside, and I finally decided that maybe I knew him just well enough to try and type him. At first I typed him as an ISTP, and some of it fit but it didn‚Äôt feel quite right. After reading about ISFPs I felt like it matched his behavior/things I‚Äôve noticed about him perfectly. However I could be wrong, if this doesn‚Äôt seem like normal ISFP behavior please don‚Äôt be afraid to correct me! 
Could anyone here possibly tell me what they think would be the best way for me to express my interest without making him feel uncomfortable or freaked out? I just want him to know that I‚Äôm interested in him but that I also respect/accept his feelings no matter what they might be 
Edit: random detail that I forgot to mention! The song he played in the video he sent me was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Yours‚Äù by Jason Mraz. Not sure if that has a hidden meaning or if I‚Äôm just overthinking. Normally I‚Äôm able to trust my gut but I have no idea what to do about this boy lol "
4933,isfp,"Guessing from the fact that you two use snapchat, I'll assume that you're still a bit younger. I really had a hard time expressing affection for someone until my late twenties, maybe it's similar for him. If he's not an idiot he should be aware that sending you that snapchat-video had a romantic undertone. Honestly, don't hold back in fear of overwhelming him. In the past, that always confused me about the girl's intentions and made me pull back as well.
Just ask him if he wants to spend time with you sometime: ""Hey, would you like to go for a coffee/dinner/walk today/tomorrow (after class)?"". Say it like you mean it, look him in the eyes and don't get nervous ~~if~~ when he looks at you like a deer caught in the headlights. I would feel insecurity on your part and become insecure as well without understanding why until much later.
That's the advice I'd give to the girls that have tried to get closer to me in the past. Hope it works out for you :)"
4934,isfp,"Just keep asking to hang out with him consistently, don't be afraid to take initiative. Go on comfy chill dates. He'll feel comfortable with you over time and it'll naturally evolve into a thing. He defs likes you if he hangs out with you but he isn't gonna express it the same way you do."
4935,isfp,dont know if this is true about all of us but i find it very difficult to communicate feelings verbally so i mostly rely on body language for that. do not read too much in to what he says because if he is really isfp what he says is likely very different from whats going on inside his head. pay close attention to how he moves and what it might mean.
4936,isfp,Girl I feel this! I am in my 40s and in love with my friend who is ISFP. Sometimes he acts territorial and jealous other times he acts disinterested. One time he will say he likes my shirt or something another time he will run away . He keeps me on my toes and I really just want him to make a move!
4937,isfp,"I'd say for me I just want to spend more time with that person, I'll be more playful with them etc. I wouldn't ever come right out and say it because yeah I don't like feeling trapped in any one paradigm. We just wanna enjoy the present moment with you, we don't think too much about the future of it. "
4938,isfp,I'm a 22 yeah old male in college with shoulder length hair and I'm thinking about cutting most of the side off but having a really long tip that parts to one side but I'm scared to do it because if I don't like it then it will take about a year to get back to where I am now. Plus I have this mental thing that it's quitting to cut my hair short now that I've finally grown it long and that that makes me a bad person. But I also don't like how it looks now so I'm in a mental tug of war with it and it's actually making me anxious because I feel stuck 
4939,isfp,"so i had this theory, i didnt think it was worth a dedicated thread, here goes
most people want a super smart / super attractive / etc person in a relationship you know
but i am trying to figure out what a stereotypical isfp would want"
4940,isfp,"Well I'm not sure how ""stereotypical"" I am, but for a relationship I would just want someone who is easy going, and good at bringing me out of my shell.  That said, I'm not really concerned about a relationship ATM. "
4941,isfp,"I just want someone who accepts me for who I am, and me to accept them for who they are. I don't have to change for you and you don't have to change for me. But if we manage to change for the better together then it's a win-win."
4942,isfp,"I need a career change. I'm leaning towards Physical Therapy Assistant. However, I have NO motivation to go through a 2 year degree and get liscencing. It feels exhausting and draining to even think about. I'm hoping I can find a way to mirror a PTA for a day, and HOPEFULLY that will inspire me to pursue. I feel like that's my only hope for motivation at this point. If the reward isn't immediate, it's damn near impossible to find motivation."
4943,isfp,"I'm in the same boat friend as a fellow ISFP and feel exactly the same. I'm SO undermotivated to go back to school for a career change (to become a counselor). Part of it is the actual going back to school, but if I really wanted to be a counselor I'd suck it up and do it, or so I tell myself. But it's the fact that like you, I'm only leaning towards it because it's the best option I can think of, but is far from a dream come true. 
My current perspective is to simplify my life and learn to enjoy the small things and embrace those moments, hobbies or relationships that give me joy, peace and some level of fulfillment. I don't know your scenario, but maybe you don't need more school or a new career at all...maybe it's an internal shift that will facilitate the motivation that you are looking for to live the life you want. Just my two cents."
4944,isfp,"Thank you for the reply, I appreciate any responses.
I can't fathom having to go to school for 2 years, let alone doing it while working a full-time job I enjoy. Then I get paranoid it'd be for nothing if I didn't enjoy it.
For me, it's hard to enjoy life if I can't enjoy my job (Considering you're there 8 hours a day). I live a pretty boring and simple life, and I have my hobbies during the weekend, but anytime I'm at work, you have to be engaged, and focused. So it's hard to enjoy your life away from work, when you still have to find a way through the 8 hours everyday first, if that makes sense. Going out and dong stuff more would help, but I still can't find a way to make going to work more enjoyable, hence needing a career change.
Here's a previous post of mine, kind of explains things related to work for me as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/5gnxwc/not_sure_if_im_an_isfp_looking_for_insight/"
4945,isfp,"I been working as commercial construction estimator 
for last 5 years and I been dying to change my field.   
Thing is... idk what the hell I want to do anymore
nor do I know if I hate my current position due to responsibilities or office environment...   
just want to talk someone with someone in similar field of work. "
4946,isfp,"I don't do anything of that, but I also get kicked with the ""I don't know what to do with my life anymore"". I wish someone gave me the answer, cause everytime I try to solve this I only get more and more questions... Sorry I couldn't help you."
4947,isfp,"It's a tool to escape boredom used heavily back in the Elementary Years, I was in the front lines and can tell you, this little doozy saved my can from Charlie more times than I could count the Fibonacci sequence to the 8th place."
4948,isfp,"I want to be good at playing the piano, but I gave up after middle school. I wanted to link a picture of the quick drawing I did, but it was late. Here it is anyways. I've been letting my hurr grow out a bit, which is where the inspiration came from lol"
4949,isfp,"It can be a strong indicator that you're ISFP, actually! Our dominant function is Fi, meaning we tend to hold strong opinions and core values that we rarely stray away from - this can easily apply to values like following rules, being honest, etc. Therefore, things can seem very black and white to us from a Fe user's standpoint, since they might not share the same innate desire to abide by such core values. They tend to abide by what the majority thinks or feels, which just so happens to be following rules.
Others might assume ISFP's don't tend to follow rules for a number of reasons: 1) Association with strong Se-doms like ESFP and ESTP, 2) Our stereotype as ""non-conformist"" (which is nevertheless true, but more applicable on a creative, aesthetic, or artistic level), 3) Our tendency to avoid commitment, which seems to correlate (but doesn't really) with a desire to break established rules, 4) Having the P as opposed to the J, which is widely misunderstood and has very few actual implications about being a rule follower or not.
Regardless, if you still feel like you're questioning being typed as an ISFP, go back and look at each type's cognitive stack and see which one fits you best! Good luck :) "
4950,isfp,"^ pretty much describes me. Following rules (established for my own use), sticking to them as much as possible and viewing/judging things in black and white. To be honest, I don't even know whether I am an ISFP or not, but I guess that doesn't really matter that much to me these days. Cool that there are other people on the interwebs that have a similar mindset when it comes to these things."
4951,isfp,"I tend to lay on the ISFP side of things, but once in a while I have some N like tendencies. I'd classify myself as a I(XS)FP I didn't think I was a J. I don't see any J like tendencies but I had a friend say they thought I was a J because of my rule following trait. Thanks though. This was a very helpful comment. "
4952,isfp,"I've never been in a serious relationship, and I don't know what I would be looking for in one. Also, no confidence in conversations, since I can easily keep one going, but I find it hard to start conversations, so I wouldn't want to go out on a date and have it be awkward lol. I think the not knowing what I want is really what is stopping me, like I want to have fun and share moments with someone of course, but that's basic."
4953,isfp,"The guy I am dating now is also an ISFP, though on the verge of INFP. I'm a bartender and he was a customer standing in the corner and caught my eye when he started talking with my regular about gaming. I don't normally date customers but I was intrigued. I'm a big gamer myself so he offered to take me to a little nerdy comic book type coffee shop thing with games, etc. We hit it off, though its taken a while to open him up completely.
Other than this guy, I've been in 2 four year relationships and they all started with a guy showing interest in one of my hobbies (horseback riding, music, etc) and me opening up. I am SUPER shy about starting conversations too outside of my work, but when you are on a date that allows you to direct attention to other things (ice skating, board games, dinner, etc) then it helps you talk about something if you get stuck. Almost EVERYONE is nervous on a first date and worried about exactly what you are so don't worry. ;)
As a suggestion, I don't know where you live, but there are SUPER fun groups you can join in on and make some new friends/ possibly meet someone. There are groups for basically every kind of hobby. Meetup.com is a good example of a site with this. "
4954,isfp,"26/f/ISFP here, dating a 22/m/ESFJ. (Well, probably. I had him take a SUPER basic version of the MBTI.) So far this is the most serious, well-balanced relationship I've had. We've been dating a little over three months, officially in a relationship for about one.
We actually met through a mutual friend maybe a year ago. I guess at the time we both thought each other was attractive but didn't say anything out think anything of it as we were both seeing other people, non-seriously. We didn't really talk or see each other again for a year until he randomly added me on Facebook and started taking to me this past November.
It took a bit for me to adjust to the age difference, but I hardly even think about it, we get along so well. I can completely be myself around him. He supports me, cares for me, treats me well. It's been a looooong time since I've had a relationship with someone I can consider to be my best friend, but that's what it is. (The only other time I had that, he turned out to be gay, so it really was just a great friendship.)
Edit: I'm a terrible conversationalist. I can't lead a conversation for shit. But with the right person, it will flow naturally. It's always a little awkward at first, getting to know someone new, but don't force it. Just let it happen."
4955,isfp,"I'm just like OP. I really, really want to have a serious relationship, but I have no idea what I really want in it or what it would feel like. It's been several months since I felt ""love-struck"" by a girl, but and that one didn't work out. It's the closest I've been to a relationship with someone, but I think it might have lessened the experience for me a little. On one hand, it increased my confidence. On the other, I have less hope of finding ""the one"". 
How do you go about simply finding people? Like, I don't expect to really feel attracted to someone unless I know more about them, but I don't see how I can really get to know them without spending a lot of time together. Is it okay for a first date to simply be a ""test-date"", just to decide if you want to talk to them more? Because I've always though that you would have the first date after getting to know them."
4956,isfp,"My current gf of 11 months was my bestfriend for 2 years previous :) Dates arent that awkward! Bring up general topics, that may very well be awkward topics but the other person will be just as glad to have something to talk about!"
4957,isfp,"My husband is extremely logic driven. I'm the opposite-emotions drive me.  I can't find his results, though.  I'm 20 and he's 41.  I guess you could call us ''opposites attract.''  We click. We get along extremely well and make each other better people :)"
4958,isfp,I'm currently dating an INFP. Her dad used to be the preacher at my great-grandparents' church and I went down every summer to help out with their VBS and we slowly got more and more connected. She's great I love her a lot. We both took the meyer-briggs test early in our relationship and it has helped A LOT because we both have very good ideas on what to look out for with ourselves and with each other. 
4959,isfp,"Not really relevant to the discussion, and I don't want to come off as a know-it-all.
But
ISFP is:
Fi - Se - Ni - Te
INFP is:
Fi - Ne - Si - Te
That's huge. It's impossible to switch between those two types unless miss-typed in the first place."
4960,isfp,"Yeah that's the personality type that is supposed to pair well with ISFP's, right? Well how did you meet? I graduated college recently and just looking for a job, not really going to look for a relationship until I get one since I don't want to go on a date and say I'm jobless haha. But I know my social relations are going to take a huge dive now that I'm going to be separated from most of my friends."
4961,isfp,"They are huge on the extremes, but you can certainly be a lesser ""S"" while having quite a few ""N"" traits. The types aren't set in stone even remotely. He is certainly an ISFP (if he was an INFP I probably wouldn't be able to communicate with him at all), but shows some INFP traits as well. He certainly can have his head in the clouds more than most ISFPs and is a bit more on the ""thinkie"" side of things than most ISFPs. His job focuses on both number and pattern manipulation as well as design and its the perfect mix for him. If you'd like the more proper term than ""verge,"" he is an ISFP with a highly developed intuition side. "
4962,isfp,"I feel that. I think it's best to get on your feet before you go looking, but then again sometimes they show up unexpectedly :)
We actually met in high school when we were 17 in the district honors choir. I liked him because he laughed at my strange ISFP humor and genuinely seemed interested! We just clicked instantly. "
4963,isfp,"Fits well with Te and Ni.
Ni+Fi gives rise to some very thinkyintuitivy-thingies. 
Yep. That fits nicely. Ni and Ne are quite different types of intuition, though it's not always easy to tell them apart. :)"
4964,isfp,"My Ni paired with my Se is the reason I will spend long periods of time pondering things, and then all at once, the answer will come to me in a sudden 'eureka!' moment. It's a little frustrating sometimes, because I can never really have a partial understanding of something. I either completely comprehend something, or don't get it at all. However, when the light comes on, it's a sweet feeling!"
4965,isfp,"I feel like my Ni is broken, where it's trying to pick up consistencies as well as help me figure out whether something is moving in a right or wrong direction, but causing headaches. At the moment, I think Ni acts a bit like a scanner for me, trying to accurately detect where something is heading, and usually it's kind of figured everything out enough that nothing is new and everything is old. Ni is so dissatisfying right now that I find myself trying to find new sources for meaning, new challenges and stimulation. Sometimes I wish Ni would stop drawing conclusions, because it kind of limits how you see things... I'm always kind of actively trying to see beyond them, but Ni is more-often-than-not a good place to start. When working properly, I think Ni says: everything will be ok."
4966,isfp,"Hi there. Just FYI, Ni is a perceiving function and not a judging function. It doesn't draw conclusions, the same way your eyes don't draw conclusions. Your eyes just drink in visual information. I think the ""scanner"" metaphor is perfect in that respect. It's your Fi that evaluates the quality of things you interact with and says ""this is good - keep pursuing it"" or ""this is bad - move onto something else."" Granted, Fi draws these conclusions from help with Ni, but again Ni does not comment on the quality of things. Ni is just an associative, abstract, judgement-free understanding of what something was like. 
For the ISFP, Ni is probably a faint voice/vision that helps with making certain decisions in the hear-and-now. For example, an ISFP musician composing a sad song might receive inspiration from Ni's deep catalogue of knowledge/experiences related to both sadness and music: minor keys, slower tempos, softer textures, clever metaphors, etc. etc. "
4967,isfp,"i eat mushrooms regularly. i also am stoned like 24/7.
i have taken a massive variety of drugs, both psychedelics and non psychedelics. 
the best advice i can give is that if things go bad, remember it is only a trip. take some deep breaths. changes in your environment can also help a lot. go to a different room, put on different music, ect. 
if you have any specific questions, i'll try to help. otherwise /r/drugs, /r/lsd, and erowid are great resources.
if you are tripping and things start to go wrong, or you just wanna talk to somebody, /r/tripsit is fantastic.
GL and happy tripping"
4968,isfp,"I had a ball on acid at home with good friends, pick a good setting and pick good people you feel totally comfortable with. This is my rule for any drug but good people will be happy to see you childish and happy and not mind any weird things you say. Also if anything goes terribly wrong you have people there to help. "
4969,isfp,"Nope. Stay far away from drugs minus a few drinks here and there. Too much addiction in my family (and in me, evidenced by 7 years of nicotine addiction before I quit) and I don't like not being in my own brain. Have fun and be careful though! :)"
4970,isfp,"Cool cool, and I've been smoking weed so it won't be my first experience with a drug, but it will be my first hallucinogen. I've done research and won't be taking a full tab so I'm comfortable with my plans to do it c:
I did have one bad time on weed and alcohol at the same time, but since I had that experience and dealt with that on a less intense drug, I think I'll be able to handle the trip.
But yeah thanks for the advice!"
4971,isfp,Yeah I say everything in moderation and I want to try most things at least once just to see how it is. Nothing hard or addictive though; alcohol is the most addictive thing I'm willing to try and even then I don't like it all that much. Thanks :D!
4972,isfp,"LSD is among the least addictive drugs. Alcohol and tobacco (not nicotine itself; tobacco contains MAOI's and other chemicals that exacerbate addiction) are significantly, significantly more addictive.
Therapeutic use (by medical practitioners, not self-administered) of psychedelics has always focused a great deal on addiction therapy (ie, they have anti-addictive properties), and as an illustrative anecdotal point, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous was actually an advocate of LSD use."
4973,isfp,"Yep. I've done it 3 times now.
Wake up early, have a filling breakfast, tab under tongue for 30, enjoy your beautiful, beautiful day!
Don't forget to drink liquids. Have LOTS of fun. Go outside! Its amazing in nature.
I always have a habit of getting WAYYY too excited on acid though. My blood pressure goes through the roof and I get a headache and sensory overload by the end of the day. Follow by insomnia because my brain is just so... Unstoppable. So I try to go to bed early the day before and wake up early.
The food advice is because food becomes... A little weird. Fruits are edible but all but one crazy guy I did acid with didn't like food on acid. And all but that crazy guy thought meat looked disgusting on acid.
Edit: share experiences, you say.
I personally love acid. It makes me really reallllly excited though and the aftereffects last for a week after, where you're just... Spent... Like mentally exhausted for a week. Disinterested, and sleepy but not really sleepy.
I cried for 4 hours. I was not sad. It was just, right. I had broken up with someone before the trip. I felt so at peace after, i don't even know.
I watched wall-e. So yes. So much emotion. So much drama. So much feels!
I've played The Secret World. It became ALIVE. I thought I was in the game. My couch had tentacles in real life.
I had showers in the rainforest. And smeared mushed pomegranate on myself and it smelled wonderful! (Body wash was flavoured XD).
Writing on whiteboards.... Breathes. It swirls and breathes.
I had also drawn a dragon on the whiteboard. It was breathing fire.
I went outside and cut a melon in the park. And petted every cat. I listened to birds, and to traffic... I went on an adventure down dark streets and got lost in the world. I found a park, equally designed in 4 corners, and sat on a bench at midnight, watching people walk in and out, thinking about their lives.
I've seen the moon, and the stars, and what makes up the universe.
I've painted all over my body with markers, I've painted over other peoples bodies with marker. I've seen every link on r/LSD. I've used fine liners on painting paper, and it bled so magnificently.
I've had sex on LSD too. I mean, if you can get excited for something as silly as sex on it, dear god the orgasms are on a whole other level."
4974,isfp,"That sounds like a really awesome time, have fun! My only recollection is things start to move a little bit or become fuzzy. I tried to sleep coming off my trip and I thought the walls were moving! You sound like you've got your head screwed on, just enjoy the ride ~"
4975,isfp,"Yea, like I said... don't like not being in my normal brain. Any remote hallucinogens make me feel worse than horrible. I've tried things, trust me. Just stay far away from them now. To each his own though!"
4976,isfp,"My very first job was as an IT associate at my dad's work, didn't need an interview or anything, so not very helpful. 
My first real job I got myself was as a video game tester for Guitar Hero 3 and Tony Hawk's Proving Grounds. It was a shit job, worked tons of overtime (mandatory 60+ hour weeks). I hated it. 
In general interviews are pretty easy for me though, just think of it as a one on one conversation with a new person. Practice practice practice. Do as many mock interviews as you can. Look up common questions and come up with some pat answers, until you can roll them off without thinking. Practice in front of a mirror. Record yourself in a mock interview and watch it later, you'll see lots of ticks and mannerisms that you don't notice in the moment, but are easily correctable."
4977,isfp,"My very first job was as a waitress, but I didn't need an interview or anything of that sort because the owner was a family friend and my mom helped convince them that I needed experience (and money). It ended up getting me just enough experience to land my first real job as stocker at a big-box company. 
The first few months are always a little rough, especially starting out not knowing anybody but as you become more of a regular it will gradually become easier. As for the interview process, for me it never really gets easier because I'm always scared of not getting hired in the exact moment (not the best). But what I try to do, like the last person suggested, to look up some questions beforehand and figuring out the right answers until it sounds right. One tip I always keep in mind while answering interview questions is think of the first thing that comes to mind but ALWAYS figure out a way to tie it in with the question in the end. Hope that helps! :)"
4978,isfp,"My first (and so far only) job is at a gas station. I know this sounds weird coming from an INTJ, but I really do enjoy working there. I get to help people solve their problems, interact with some really cool people, have great coworkers, and never really get a chance to get bored. The only thing I hate about it is anything to do with lottery tickets. People will come in with an absurd quantity of tickets and it takes forever and a day to scan them in to see if they've won or not. It doesn't help that people almost never just take the money they win; no, they spend all of it (and then some) on more lottery tickets. Still, that's one small thing I dislike out of many things I enjoy. 
Advice: Look presentable during the job interview. You don't have to dress to the nines, but wearing a blue button shirt and khakis or a nice dress can go a long way towards getting you that job. Make sure that your breath smells good, that your hair is presentable, and that your face is free of excessive facial hair. Also, if you're having trouble on the job, don't be afraid to ask for help. It's better to humble yourself and ask a more experienced coworker to show you how to do something than it is to do it yourself and end up messing up. "
4979,isfp,"I worked at a grocery store! It sucked pretty hard haha. I've had a few jobs, thankfully haven't been fired! Best key to interviews is confidence. Eye contact, steady speech, don't fiddle with your hands or rock the chair back and forth  (got called out in my first job interview for doing these things, but fortunately my employer was very gracious and realized it was my first interview)."
4980,isfp,"Im an Infp. The reason i asked was because i typed a friend as isfp but like me he frequently zones out and it made me question my analysis. Thanks for the response, it helps for me to better understand this type"
4981,isfp,"Wow, this was interesting. Who the hell finished in five mins? Took me at least ten or fifteen...guess my Se isn't what I thought it was... Anyway here's my results as an ENFP:
Realism 10
Impressionism 10
Post Impressionism 8
Classicism 8
Expressionism 3
Baroque 6
Rococo 5
Romanticism 6"
4982,isfp,"I'm kind of type-confused at the moment, so ignore my flair.  I'm a big stickler for composition and sensation of place, which explains my favouritism for realism and impressionism...  I just went through by gut, though.
http://imgur.com/CNN90Aw"
4983,isfp,"ISFJ here, these are my results:
Romanticism: 11
Classicism: 8
Impressionism and Post-Impressionism: 7
Expressionism, Baroque, Rococo: 6
Realism: 5
This was really interesting. I don't know much about art at all, but this has made me want to explore it more."
4984,isfp,"I anyways thought of myself as enjoying impressionism most. I was almost right. I was surprised to see romanticism, but when I googled it...yeah, that's fairly accurate.
I would even argue I might like expressionism more, except that it's very hit or miss. I either LOVE it or think it's creepy or ugly."
4985,isfp,"Yeah, I think they've tested every category against every other, but I'm not sure. I really enjoy this test and it is interesting to see different perspectives! You and I have some similarities but also great differences-- e.g. expressionism, haha! I... can't understand expressionism that doesn't follow geometrical patterns or some kind of structure. It isn't that I don't think some are really cool, it's just I pick other types of paintings over most expressionist. :P
What did you find yourself using as criteria for picking? I went between a gut ""I like this one more"" and as a tie breaker ""this one has better technique/is more interesting as a painting""."
4986,isfp,"Hehe. It is a long test. I usually take 7-10 minutes. I really hesitated a lot at the beginning, trying to think about the complexities of the pieces and stuff but then I realized it wasn't about technique first and foremost, it was about what I liked better. After that it was a lot easier. I feel like it isn't perfect because some paintings might be preferred over another by criteria that has nothing to do with either period-- for instance, there was a drab landscape vs an interesting one. This had less to do with the period of art and more to do with the artist and subject. shrug It's still a really fun test, and has pretty accurate results. :D"
4987,isfp,"I think it helps that I've taken art history classes?  It's easier to appreciate some art movements when you've learned about them and their historical contexts.  I like expressionism since its so emotional and in your face.  I guess it just seemed more honest in comparison to some of the other stuff?  Thinking back on the test, I think it's interesting they didn't try to venture in any of the weirder, more recent art movements. XD
Aaah I basically asked myself, ""Which would I rather have on my wall and stare at for a long time?"" XD  I don't really know how to articulate the decision-making process, but I guess its whichever I appreciated more."
4988,isfp,"""I don't know how to articulate the decision making process"" -- lol, so F. :D That's me too... unless something pops out then I just feel my way into the decision. I know for me it helps to understand technique and how difficult it is to do things like realism. I don't actually know a ton about how to identify certain characteristics of art periods because I know a lot about a few periods but not much else. shrug If you think you enjoy art more because of XYZ then it's probably true, because it's subjective! Yay! :)"
4989,isfp,"Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) 
You don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is: 
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
Any comments, ideas, critics are welcome!"
4990,isfp,"This is just the 16personalities test with a few extra questions...
Plus cognitive functions would be a better thing to test anyways. Testing individual traits tends to be a bit iffy. A lot of types often display many traits associated with the opposite for a trait. Take ISFPs for example - many ISFPs tend to favour art and creativity over practicality, despite having the S trait."
4991,isfp,"Curious ENFP here, are you guys into like talking philosophical ideas and stuff? I have some ISFP friends and dated ISFP girls in the past, and they seem really into these conceptual Seinfeldian conversations. I think ISFP might be the most iNtuitive sensors "
4992,isfp,I really enjoy philosophical discussions. I haven't read much by philosophers so it's often just bouncing ideas off of each other about how the world does and should work. Sometimes these talks can turn into debates though and that can be frustrating because my ideas are often idealistic and I might take it personally if someone attacks my logic without being constructive.
4993,isfp,"Totes. And it's not often you get to have one with someone who is actually interested in doing it and will engage without feeling personally offended by debate. I personally love it. It's so much fun thinking about and engaging with ideas with other people. And note I said other people. That's important. It's well enough to read about this stuff on my own, but to discuss it with others is pretty fun."
4994,isfp,"Female ISFP here, I studied philosophy in college, focused in symbolic logic. I honestly find that talking philosophy with my N friends is hit or miss in how it stimulates me. I recently had dinner with an INTJ guy I'm dating and my INTP male friend, and they got into a long conversation about the philosophy behind a random scifi novel and how it related to the current state of the financial industry. I got bored after awhile and started talking about how good my quesadilla was hahaha "
4995,isfp,Absolutely! I love talking about philosophy and anything that has to do with the universe and the way things work. Or just thinking deeply about and analyzing things in general is so fun for me - I could talk for days about some of these subjects. 
4996,isfp,"Not everyone knows to or does naturally the act of being constructive in every statement they make. Don't penalize the person with a ruined reputation in your head for them just because its too hard for you to say ""How do you think I can better _____?"""
4997,isfp,"Maybe it's just because of the people that I've surrounded myself with for the past five years, but I think I'd fit right in with that conversation. Philosophy, economics, quantum physics - I could talk about them all day!   
Unsurprisingly, I have a lot of NTP/NTJ friends."
4998,isfp,"Interesting. When it comes to abstract conversations such as Philosophy I get really ""ENTJ"" about it. I need facts, facts, facts, and pure logic. That's why I'm agnostic when my entire family and extended family is super catholic. Philosophy is an activity for the mind. Without logic, what's the point?  
I think it's interesting to see how diverse even us ISFP's can really be. "
4999,isfp,"It's not like I lose any friendships over debates. It's more that I feel invested in my ideas even if they are just a feeling. A debate is a situation where ideas can be undermined and torn down. I typically like to concentrate on the positives of an argument, working towards a common agreement, so as to avoid personal conflict. But I often grow tired of debating when a person doesn't seem to be open to my ideas. Also, sometimes I feel emotionally drained afterwords if the person is very critical, even if it's just of my logic. 
TL;DR: it's the debate I don't like, not the person."
5000,isfp,"Ahh, that makes sense. I misunderstood what you said. I think I'm the same way.   
I used to enjoy Philosophy for the sake of philosophy, but that might have just been because I enjoyed learning different logics since it was all new to me. At this point, I pretty much only have interest in it if I can apply it to my current beliefs in some way."
5001,isfp,"Not.
There's this girl I'm trying to figure out. I'm very sure she's an Fi dom but not that sure if she's an ISFP or an INFP. So, if you guys would answer these really odd questions that would be real nice of you. It just help me see how you think.
(Feel free to ask me questions about her too!)

What's your opinion on history?
Do you feel like it's fulfilling/fun with being sarcastic?
Do you often just give up if a problem gets too hard?
Do you enjoy talking about your family?
Are you often straight forward when talking about your feelings and opinions?
What do you think of ENTP's?

Thanks for helping me :D
(Yeah I just copied this from INFP but who cares)"
5002,isfp,"Sure I'll answer.
1. What's your opinion on history? I like visiting historical sites and museums. Currently taking a United States History class and it is cool, but hard to remember facts. When I visit historical places, I really enjoy looking around and experiencing the site, not as much learning facts about it.
2. Do you feel like it's fulfilling/fun with being sarcastic? I am often sarcastic. Sometimes I am so sarcastic, people think I am being serious (deadpan). Then I have to tell them I am joking and it's not as funny because then it's just a little awkward.
3. Do you often just give up if a problem gets too hard? I'm not so sure about this one. I suppose so. I have a hard time starting tasks. It's hard to give up when you never started in the first place.
4. Do you enjoy talking about your family? Also not so sure about this one, since I never really talk about them. I have no issues talking about them. If anyone asks me, I answer honestly. If they ask how my relationship with my sister is, I tell them it wasn't always great but now it's ok. That kind of stuff.
5. Are you often straight forward when talking about your feelings and opinions? I'm very straight forward with my feelings and telling people about them. Not as much opinions, because I don't like putting myself out there. That is because if someone disagrees, I'd have to defend my opinions and that's hard to do, because my opinions are my feelings. Instead of lying (I almost never lie), I just do not disclose my opinion. Usually I either do not have an opinion, or I say I do not have an opinion.
6. What do you think of ENTPs? I don't know if I've ever met one.
Hope I could help you figure out this girl. I had fun answering questions. I had trouble in the beginning deciding if I was an INFP or an ISFP. I ultimately decided I am ISFP because I am very Se."
5003,isfp,"

History tells you how you got here, the random and not so random events that led to 'now'. It gave me an existential crisis.


Yup, sarcasm is fun if its mutually appreciated.


If I can go no further then I would give up.


I enjoy talking about them (And their mbti types).


Yes


One of the best people to have along for outdoor activities. And there are no awkward silences! 


Good luck with the girl!"
5004,isfp,"

What's your opinion on history?
If that makes any sense, I find almost everything interesting to the point that I just really love listening to somebody who knows a lot about the topic at hand. Doesn't mean that I'll remember every fact they told me but if somebody has a unique opinion on something / a special interest in something I'm fascinated and it doesn‚Äôt even matter if it has any concrete value what they‚Äôre talking about.. I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm especially fascinated by Ne / Ni doms. Actually for me ENTPs and INTJs are the most fascinating people on earth, I could listen to them for hours.


Do you feel like it's fulfilling/fun with being sarcastic?
I‚Äôm not sarcastic very often because I‚Äôm also not the most quick-witted, though I can be sarcastic if in the right mood.
Still I enjoy sarcastic people a lot.


Do you often just give up if a problem gets too hard?
I totally agree with reptasmic on this.


Do you enjoy talking about your family?
Yes, but only if asked specific questions (also being honest is very important to me) or if you tell me something I can relate to you‚Äôll get to hear my story too.


Are you often straight forward when talking about your feelings and opinions?
My feelings are / Fi is .. confusing, even or especially for myself. I can tell you exactly what I feel at any given moment  (‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù, ‚Äúhappy‚Äù, ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù) and will certainly not lie about it but most of the time I don‚Äôt know and hence can‚Äôt tell you why I feel a certain way. So if I tell you that I‚Äôm in a bad mood but can‚Äôt tell you why, it‚Äôs better to don‚Äôt ask further questions (‚Äúwas it something at work?‚Äù ‚Äústress with your parents?‚Äù) or ‚Äì even worse ‚Äì if you make suggestions / telling me what you think that made me upset and can‚Äôt accept if it‚Äôs not what you thought  (because if you make a suggestions I will know if what you think feels right or not and most of the time it isn‚Äôt).
Maybe that wouldn‚Äôt be your approach at all, just felt the need to add it. One of my closest friends (probably ESFJ or ENFJ) does this all the time and it just stresses me out to the point that I want to punch her in the face though I‚Äôm normally the most relaxed person on earth.
I do like talking about my opinions, if I even have one, and if someone has a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù one I also easily change my opinions very fast. But this always depends on the topic‚Ä¶


What do you think of ENTP's?
Actually I think I‚Äôm dating one at the moment, didn‚Äôt get him to make the test til now though lol. But as I mentioned above, Ne doms are very fascinating to me and we can talk for hours, both jumping from topic to topic and getting back to the original one whenever it comes back to our mind.. I read in some threads that the ENTP / ISFP pairing can be difficult, but maybe the age gap in my special case also has a positive impact (he‚Äôs 34, I‚Äôm 21).
With him it‚Äôs just an easy conversation, though he is talking most of the time, I too can contribute a lot to the conversation and I just feel that he gets what I‚Äôm saying and vice versa the same. And I just love listening to him, whatever he talks about I just suck it up like a sponge and ...yeah it just feels soo good being around him from the first moment until now.


Edit - I also love Lip from shameless! :P"
5005,isfp,"

History has never been my thing, but I hear it's because my teachers taught poorly, making us memorize dates and so on.


Every once in a while sarcasm is fun, I guess. Not something I freely use in most daily conversations though.


Yes, if I feel a problem is no longer worth the time, I'll move on.


I'm terrible at talking about my family. I've been married for nearly a year now, and literally yesterday my mother in law had to make sure I did in fact have siblings... LOL


Yes, I am almost always very honest and straight forward with my feelings. I am way more careful when it comes to stating my opinion. 


My husband is one :) honestly the healthiest relationship I've been in. We both compliment each other despite our dominant functions being each others' PoLR. 

"
5006,isfp,"

What's your opinion on history? It's interesting but I don't seek it out based on my experience with extremely dry history textbooks.


Do you feel like it's fulfilling/fun with being sarcastic?
I am not sarcastic.
3.Do you often just give up if a problem gets too hard?
Yes

Do you enjoy talking about your family?
Yes, but I'm not going to open up about them easily.
Are you often straight forward when talking about your feelings and opinions?
No, sometimes I think out loud with people I am close to. I can say one thing and then by the evening realize that I feel differently. If it's a negative feeling I have a really hard time confronting someone about it. 
What do you think of ENTP's?
I've never met an ENTP, but Lip Gallagher from shameless is apparently one and I like his character despite identifying him as an asshole.
"
5007,isfp,"
History: I like learning about people's day to day lives and values from a given period. A lot of times the culture might seem completely alien and fantastical, yet with enough context (history giving us the benefit of hindsight/continuity), it makes sense. What makes it even more interesting is that it was real. On the other hand, it's kind of cool (humbling!) to see how some things haven't changed so much. Still, very interesting.
Sarcasm: I find it fun, but not fulfilling. Because of that, I get tired of it sometimes.
Giving up: No, I hate giving up. If it's difficult it makes me want to try harder. Knowing this about myself makes it hard for me to commit in the first place though. It takes me a long time to let go.
Family: the topic itself is kind of neutral to me. If the person who's asking is someone I like talking to, I can talk with them about anything.
Feelings & opinions: I try very much to be straightforward, but if it's someone who I don't think will respect what I'm about to share, I won't bother.
ENTP: I'm not sure I know any, personally.
"
5008,isfp,"hi lovelies! I made a new friend recently, an ISFP, and I just want some advice on how to handle the friendship and things with them. Nothing bad has happened, but I really like her and don't want to mess up the friendship so I'm looking for advice prior to any problems. 
im an ESFP and maybe not the best at maintaining healthy long relationships, but this ISFP is someone really special and I want her to be around for super long.
we met thru a tutor site- im 17F and needed a math tutor so she, 19F, tutored me maybe once a week for like about two months. At first we only talked about math but after a month we would drift off into conversation about random things, and laughed a lot and basically i enjoyed her company SO much. then eventually i made the decision to drop this math subject for an easier one that would match my career decision (wedding/events planning). I told her I wasn't gunna need tutoring anymore and this was our last lesson- which i was super sad about- but then I was like, Yo how about lets get dinner! 
she seemed hella keen so we got dinner and totally hit it off!! now as an ESFP y'all probably expect me to be super social, but heres the thing- I dont really get along with people that well. I give off that impression bc I hang a lot w people but there's no one I feel really connected to. HOWEVER this ISFP makes me feel a wHOLE sum different kinda way. we click like heck, we get along SO easily and even when we have different opinions and disagree its still easy and non-conflictive. 
anyways we've only gotten dinner 1x but during that time we agreed upon going on a road trip together (YAY) and saving up and travelling Europe! isnt that great!!! we're also gunna have a movie night and im gunna teach her how 2 make lasagne in like a week or two. i've forreal never been so excited to hang out with a friend before, but i dont want to scare her off/mess up/be a dumb fuck!
do you guys have any advice?????? like how do i approach things w her? how often should we hang?? are there certain things i shouldnt do???
also do you think she likes me (like platonically duh) or do u think she thinks im annoying?  ??  she replies to my texts like a few hours later or maybe 1-2 days later generally but they're always comprehensive, not-short, answers whatever im asking and yes she gives me dates when she is free! she also sends smiley faces! is it just a thing that ISFP's are bad at replying to texts asap? i dont mind but i just get worried bc i highkey textback generally fast.
idk!!! i guess i just want to know

what do u think she thinks of me?? 
any advice maintaining an ESFP-ISFP friendship. like what should i do to be a good friend and give her space
do u think she likes me ?? ? ? or is she just being nice

anyways thank you!!!! I love you guys from what ive seen. Hope ur all doing well and finding ESFP(or whatever) friends who super duper love you too!
sorry if this was a weird post. i just cant stop thinking about it hahaha"
5009,isfp,"Dont be alarmed by the slow response time on the texts - that's just how texting is. As long as you're not messaging constantly you should be fine! It sounds like she wants to hang out with you, and she's doing so, so just keep suggesting events every now and then! 
Avoid being judgemental, and do fun things and you're golden. If she didnt want to hang out with you she'd probably just drop off the face of the earth."
5010,isfp,"This may help as a blanket kind of statement on how we are with friendships:
https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-friends
Just remember introverts enjoy their alone time as well, we need it to recharge since socializing can really drain us mentally and emotionally. Movie nights are great for this, you're technically socializing but with zero pressure to socialize or be ""on"" so to speak since you're watching a movie! Also I know I'm terrible at replying to texts or emails, I say to myself ""oh I should really respond to this"" and then get to responding a few hours or a day later even with family."
5011,isfp,"She probably genuinely likes you. I know only one ESFP and our relationship has a great dynamic. Funny, he‚Äôs also not very social. He just expressive and enjoys things like public speaking, teaching etc. 
I can‚Äôt speak for everyone but I personally am very selective about who I am friends with. And even more selective about who I make long term plans with. So it seems like it‚Äôs all positive. 
Slow texting is normal, talking all the time is exhausting. Just keep it casual and seems like it‚Äôll be a great friendship over time üòä"
5012,isfp,"thank u !!! and i literally remember her telling me she would leave outings early bc she was too tired and kinda just went home and slept lolol
and thats really assuring bhahaha. im glad shes not ignoring my messages bc she doesnt like me, but rather its her personality haha
thank you!"
5013,isfp,"yayaya!! that is So good to hear! im honestly so happy most ISFP's r like this haha
and isnt it weird how the ESFP stereotype is party animal? i find that we're also pretty introverted and enjoy being alone too. 
anyways thank you!! and i totes understand the slow texting thing- ppl who constantly text are kinda hard to deal with"
5014,isfp,"Do you have a passion, something you would go to the end of the world for if you could do it for a living?
Do you like talking about your strengths? For example for a job interview.
What do you do if you need to be confident?
EDIT: Why isn't there some flowery pattern in your subreddit banner"
5015,isfp,"...oh! hey, thanks ( *¬∞ -¬∞ )/
I do have a passion, it's art... sounds stereotypical, I know. Cosplay, dancing, photography, photo shoots, digital art, performing, sewing, piano... I've wanted to do all these things at some point in my life. So, something related to those. And also to a lesser extent helping/some kind of service duty. And nature and animals too. 
I don't like talking about my strengths, because I can't exactly pinpoint what they are... haha. Not at least when asked to on the spot. For a job interview it's a different thing of course... 
What do I do to be confident? Man, these are kinda good questions. Haven't thought about that. I guess I become more engaging, attentive, serious and thoughtful about my answers. 
And about the ISFP banner... I think there'd been a post for a new banner, but don't know what happened to that... It'd be nice if there was one though. (We just have to get our lazy asses up once again(!?)I know, it's troublesome)
...eh. have a nice week"
5016,isfp,"I'm a big fan of theatrical lighting, we'll see how that changes after I start doing it on a much higher level in university, but right now it's something that can get me more excited than most anything else.
Like /u/eoufdeesh said, I also generally can't come up with anything when asked to describe myself or my strengths. When I can, I tend to heavily undersell myself, that way I don't disappoint anyone. I'd rather have my ability to do something end up being a surprise.
Usually if I need to be confident it either happens on its own, or it doesn't at all."
5017,isfp,"I guess my passion would be literature and analysing literature texts. I'm into philosophy too but I'm taking music. (I unexpectedly find myself enjoying when I sing so yeah.)
When I'm asked to describe myself I can't come up with anything at all. I don't know what to say. I never really stopped to think about things and when I am asked, well, I don't know. (Haha)
I'm a vocal performance major and that means I have to have a fuckton of confidence. What I do is basically just tell myself how I haven't managed to fuck up so far so what difference does it make this time? I focus on what I have to do too. Decide on the results/output that I want and have to produce and how I'm going to do it. When my mindset has switched to that I block everything else and just think that I just have to do. There's no time for lollygagging AT ALL.
I like looking at flowers. They're pretty. They make useful symbolisms for poetry too but I don't really spend too much time on reddit to edit that. LOL"
5018,isfp,"I havent found a passion but i like drawing and making music sometimes.
Im pretty good at coming off as charming and confident for job interviews and stuff. I dont really believe that i have the strengths that i say i have but I can keep the facade up for about 30 minutes lol. 
Youre right we should have a cool banner or something."
5019,isfp,"Do you have a passion, something you would go to the end of the world for if you could do it for a living?
Not really. Maybe go on adventures with my friends. Or have a little family/homestead. 
Do you like talking about your strengths? For example for a job interview.
I'm ok with giving facts, but I might not be aware of my strengths/limitations.  
What do you do if you need to be confident?
Socially? Warm-up (voice, body). If it's for an interview: be prepared (i.e. have relevant skills/experience), know that I would be useful and not a burden."
5020,isfp,"yes i do, music composition. i really want to be a professional performer and wish i was better with the technical aspects of playing instruments.
i do NOT like talking about my strengths. i feel simultaneously worse and better at everything than others and compare myself to them constantly, so it's not that i can't think of strengths, but i don't like the idea of my boss getting high expectations and then being disappointed. i would rather impress people by doing better than they expected.
if i need to be confident i pretend i'm a fictional character that is confident. it's very easy for me to project mental states of characters or people i've known. it works too."
5021,isfp,"Do I have a passion? Not in the typical sense, but I am extremely passionate about helping people. I'm a firm believer that everyone needs someone, and if I can be that someone, I generally want to be. This can be emotionally draining sometimes though if I dont lower my expectations and acknowledge that I probably wont get the same treatment in return.
Talking about my strengths is honestly really difficult. But I think it's because I see my strengths as weaknesses as well. It's super confusing because isfp's can be very aware of all sides in a situation. So where my compassion may be seen as a strength sometimes, it's definitely a weakness at other times and so trying to only see it as a strength just isn't really possible for me.
For an interview. it reaaaaaally helps me to have an understanding of the job I am interviewing for beforehand. Some positions need a certain set of strengths, so if I know what the position requires, I can typically focus on just that one side of my characteristic and talk about it being only a strength. 
I personally dont have issues with needing confidence as I am fairly confident already. I'll typically only need that boost if I'm doing something that makes me uncomfortable, which is usually talking to groups of random people. That's when I'll use the whole ""fuck it, what's the worst that's going to happen?: I dont get the job? I fart in front of a stranger? I trip and fall?
Damn, that was way wordier than I wanted."
5022,isfp,"My passions are literature, languages, tv series, books.
I've read through the other answers and I saw that no one likes to talk about their strengths, but actually I think that I've come to some kind of self knowledge (?) so I can easily say what I'm good at and what I'm bad at.
Confident? Uhm, I don't know ahah
Maybe I think that it's time to stop being weak, that I know my value and that I should stay relaxed, even if I got it wrong at least I tried, there will be another occasion. Now the question is if this self-persuasion really works..."
5023,isfp,"First, thanks for your answer
To clarify, because I want to support the ISFP in my life a little better, what do you do for a job interview?
Also you have counted a lot of things as your passions. Would you go to the end of the world for them or risk annoying somebody close by talking too much about them? (maybe I should have chosen the word ""obsession"" instead of ""passion"" .... ""obspassion"")
You too have a nice week :D"
5024,isfp,"What do I do in a job interview? You mean as in how do I act in one? (If not please clarify?) I guess I'll try to be myself and be calm, but it'd also be good to be prepared as well as I can... so, if you want to help the ISFP in your life you could try asking them some interview questions? Like to give him/her the feel of being in an interview? Because as for myself I sometimes tend to underestimate the seriousness of formal situations therefore getting in trouble with authorities sometimes... cough
Ehm, I think some of them I will definitely pursue no matter what... but I'm not sure if it's a ""till the end of the world"" kind of thing. If I'm passionate/obsessed enough about something then I will pursue it. It's impossible for me not to pursue things I am interested in (as I imagine is for many people). I think, though, ISFPs will sometimes need a little push (external or internal), or encouragement, to ACTUALLY pursue their passions, instead of passively letting it be an idea in their heads (sounds weird, I know!?). (But please, do it gently. We can't handle being ""forced"" to do things.) 
Oh and I would say I don't usually risk talking about my ""obspassions"" too much, unless it's people who are interested in the same thing, or people I know closely and whom I can trust would be genuinely interested in hearing them out, I think? Even then I would be vary about rambling about them, instead of testing the waters whether the person is interested in hearing more or not.
(edit: sorry I rambled)"
5025,isfp,"you're welcome! not really, honestly. i don't experience Fi so much as having an ""authentic sense of self"" as having crystal clear (and somewhat polarized) reactions and emotions. there is a specific way i want other people to see me but it's not necessarily 100% authentic or even 50%. i'm satisfied with understanding myself, i don't need everyone else to. i would honestly rather be liked than understood because i find criticism and rejection extremely hard to deal with.
when i empathize with another person/idea of a person in this way it feels more like my sense of self has expanded and it's kind of a refreshing change honestly. it's difficult to apply it to more than one person simultaneously though."
5026,isfp,"Things that drive me insane about this video- the 50 second intro, taking forever to tell each story, edited but still left in the ""ums"". Nice video for people who like storytelling and babbling but def not tailored for isfp viewers."
5027,isfp,"I couldn‚Äôt finish the video. It was painful. 
The part about her finding the fact that her mom doesn‚Äôt see her logic seemed funny to me. Like if her mom doesn‚Äôt agree with her or take her opinion into consideration, she isn‚Äôt being logical. That‚Äôs silly and a little arrogant. "
5028,isfp,lol i'm subscribed to her. yeah she's annoying but idk i like watching her sometimes. she only has good things to say about isfps too lol. i love hearing the world appreciate us even tho we're cunts hahaha
5029,isfp,"I believe all relationships have their own strengths and weaknesses so there's not a list that I can give you. But as an ISFP male I can share what is essential in my relationships. 
I respond to authenticity. I become stressed when I am around people who aren't real or genuine, especially when it's someone close. Anyone who tries to be someone that they are not really turns me off. In other words, I find individuality very attractive. Someone who has the confidence to be different, but with none of the arrogance that might come with it. 
Just be yourself. "
5030,isfp,I like it when I can just be myself-- when people accept my weirdness and flaws and try to understand me. You might want to find out her enneagram because type 9 isfps are very different from type 4 isfps. Type 4s may have issues with jealousy while type 9s may have issues with confrontation. 
5031,isfp,"ISFP care about authenticness, here's a link to an ISFP woman killing her kids irrationally:
http://www.theindychannel.com/news/crime/court-docs-mom-killed-her-2-young-children-so-that-husband-couldnt-have-custody-in-divorce
/INFP, the wiser version of ISFP"
5032,isfp,"As an ISFP male myself, this is 100% accurate. 
Personally, I also really like being complimented on something about my character. ""you're so easy going, it makes me feel relaxed around you."" ... ""you're such a good listener, it really makes me happy to know I have a friend like you"". 
Hearing that is like ecstasy. "
5033,isfp,I think jealousy and confrontation are good things for OP to look out for. I struggled a lot with those when I was in a relationship. I've found that the most important thing for me in a relationship is openness and trust. 
5034,isfp,"I loathe conflict, can't stand even internet arguments, get anxious over raised voices... I think it has more to do with me being neurological than my type though. I'm pretty sure I've come across a lot of I_FPs on the internet who relish in arguing over their morals with closed minds and refusal to believe they're wrong, ugh..."
5035,isfp,"Fi doesn‚Äôt care about group harmony but we sure as shit don‚Äôt like to feel personally attacked. Plus we have a shameful inferior Te. That coupled with auxiliary Se means we can have temperamental ragey outbursts which can be pretty humiliating, especially later on when we‚Äôve recouped and are trying to reign our emotions back in and guard them.
Like why bother now, we‚Äôre already exposed. This is why I hate conflict. Brings out the inner anger I spend most of my time trying to suppress."
5036,isfp,Nah man. You should read up on it more. Fe users are averse to conflict in and on behalf of the group and Fi users are averse to conflict inside the individual whether thats in themselves or perceived in another person.
5037,isfp,"Seeing life through a Fi-lense makes one sensitive to conflict by having the individual feel as though they are being personally attacked. 
Also, a greater feeling score (regardless of Fi or Fe) is bound to make an individual averse to conflict for the simple fact that feeling functions are, well, feeling. Feeling negative emotions is none too exciting for anybody, me thinks.
Besides, as an INFJ myself, I have a rather strong Fe function, but when it comes down to the harmony of the group, or my personal convictions, I‚Äôd rather disrupt the harmony. Maybe I‚Äôm an anomaly in this sense, but as a type 4, I have a passionate want for personal-expression, and typically find that it‚Äôs easier to stand my ground on what I believe in, than it is to lose a piece of myself every time the group disagrees with me. While I‚Äôd rather not fight, I don‚Äôt surrender either, and given the choice between conforming or being myself, you better believe I‚Äôm choosing originality."
5038,isfp,"I‚Äôm an ISFP, and for me the closer I am to a person and the better I know them, the more happily and readily engage in conflict with them without always worrying about hurting their feelings with off-color or insensitive jokes, and may even enjoy getting into arguments sometimes because I know that I won‚Äôt make myself hated or draw negative attention from a large group of people that will damage my reputation if you accept me. There‚Äôs enough of a sense of comfortable harmony and trust that‚Äôs been been built up in our relationship for me to be more blunt and harsh with my opinions and feelings with you if we‚Äôre close friends and/or family and bickering with each other when we disagree on issues or cracking off-color jokes is just what we do. The less I know you, the more conflict avoidant I become. I‚Äôll speak really softly, I may even become passive to a fault by leaving things up to chance, and just letting things happen when a conflict may need to be started and/or confronted for us to reach a common ground."
5039,isfp,"Thank you, this. I'm not trying to burn any one type, but in my experience with ISFPs (immature ones especially) they have this weird tendency to be extremely self centered and selfish, but not in a stereotypical way... and worse, they dont even realize it. They are self centered in that they cant see that what feels right to them, may not always be whats right for everyone. 
For example, if there is conflict, they refuse to address it. Why? Because they dont want to feel ""mean"" or ""harsh"". So instead they just ignore the person who they misunderstood, not realizing that this can actually hurt that person a lot more, for a whole lot longer. They will do anything to feel like they are a good person right now ... without thinking about how it might affect others in the future. "
5040,isfp,"I‚Äôll take a stab at it, and say that hostile social environments, argumentativeness, and criticism would all disrupt inner harmony. I know it does for me. ISFPs have a hard outer shell, but a soft core that they need to protect from personal attacks and criticism."
5041,isfp,"It doesn't, they are two different things.
ISFP's score high in the 9w8 and 9w1 enneagram which is related to intrapersonal harmony while enneagram 2 is the interpersonal harmony. 
While an ISFP 9 could become just as agitated as an ESFJ 2 for being encroached upon, they would be arriving that conclusion from the completely opposite side of one another.  The Fi user might find their self needing to defend its social circle, or a lone Fe user may be personally offended by a severe break of their understanding of the customary rules that govern human interaction."
5042,isfp,"In the sense of the theory? MBTI is the pattern your brainwaves naturally form. It is the personality you are born with, and it seems to persist unless something traumatic dramatically shifts this pattern. Enneagram however, is the traits added on top of your base personality. These traits are developed in the early years of life, and are reactive in nature, being taught rather than being an innate part of your original mindset. MBTI is nature, while enneagram is nurture.
In the sense of possessing multiple functions in the same category(Being an INFJ with Fe, but being a type 4 with an affinity for Fi)? According to Jung -the man who first made the theory upon which MBTI is based- he also believed that every person has all 8 functions. 4 are conscious, 4 subconscious(shadow functions). It was his belief that the subconscious ones were no less important to your personality that the conscious ones, and, in fact, he theorized that we could embrace our shadows, learn from them, and make them into a more balanced part of a whole personality. It seems he didn‚Äôt believe a personality was even whole until it came to peace with it‚Äôs shadows.
In this sense, as a type 4, I lean heavily on Fi, and am possibly more balanced than I‚Äôd otherwise be as a result. It gives me the advantage of knowing more about who I am, what I want, how I feel, how to express who I am, makes my convictions clearer, and makes boundaries easier to form. I also have no real issue ending relationships of any kind (so long as I feel justified), doorslams are a switch I can turn on and off almost at will. All this while still being highly empathic, absorbing everyone else‚Äôs‚Äô emotions, understanding their feelings, and hoping to maintain harmony so long as it does not contradict my convictions."
5043,isfp,"Rather than because we are trying to make ourselves in the right, I think it is actually more that we dont give a shit about that person or how they feel anymore so we just do whatever is convenient for us. In the end why would I be bothered to think about how to please someone I dont care and/or arnt beneficial to me anymore?"
5044,isfp,"It wasn't meant as an insult, also, I think it's a reason why some isfps get mistyped as infj. It's not true Fe and it's not concerned about the relations of things or hierarchical standing, it's your feelings about the physical environment. Usually the situation is being misread as being much more severe than it is, but that's due to tert Ni, I'm guessing, and the resolution usually leads back to the ISFP attempting to coax the situation on their favor or their idea of personal harmony, a bit short sighted in terms of others involved."
5045,isfp,"I don‚Äôt see how this is cruel. ISFPs value their individuality and the individuality and distinctness of others. If I‚Äôm really clashing with someone and it‚Äôs starting to take its toll on me, it makes more sense to remove myself from the situation or the relationship than try to change someone. "
5046,isfp,"No, it makes you feel better... to just give up on somebody. That's why its selfish. Because its all about how you feel, with no consideration for them. That isn't how we should treat our friends... again, i share zero cognitive functions with you so my thought to word translation may be a bit lost... and im bad at tact"
5047,isfp,"Ive never given up on a friend but I have decided that I don‚Äôt want to be around certain people anymore. I think I‚Äôm defending a different scenario. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm abandoning my closest friends when they are in need. I just change my mind about people after they clash with what‚Äôs important to me enough or do something really awful. It does make me feel better than just resigning to the fact that I have to spend time with someone who I don‚Äôt get along with. 
I‚Äôm not sure what you think I should be doing. Should I try to change someone and make them more like me? Should I just ignore what is important to me? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs selfish to be selective on who you spend your time with. "
5048,isfp,"Thats the problem. If someone no longer care about how you feel then you are no longer friends, which means your expectation doesnt really have a ground. You cant force someone to care about you just because you still care about them. 
Never understood the we have to stick by each other no matter what because we are friends mentality. So what if you‚Äôve been friends for x years? People change and the past is no longer. Often the people having to hold onto their friends so dearly is because they lack the ability to form new relationships and they feel just because you put so much time into spending with someone that they owe you to spend time with you in the future, kind of like the mentality of saving money for later."
5049,isfp,"If they were your friend, don't you think that your friendship might be more important to them than your differences? Instead of thinking ""oh we clashed, this is over now i guess"", you could choose to actually try and fix the friendship... because if you both care and are willing to communicate, there isn't a problem that you cant work through.
Its not selfish to be selective, it is selfish to abandon somebody who was your friend just because you hit a rough patch... because again, thats ALL about you... what if they didn't even notice that they were bugging you? What if they were an oblivious INTP and then you just suddenly stop talking to them and refuse to hang out with them? I have no problem with talking it out, and letting them know that you are done... thats your right... but just ghosting someone will hurt them a hell of a lot more than telling them that you dont want to be friends anymore... especially if they have anxiety issues like i do... speaking from experience, i wish this individual would have at least texted me and told me why, because i didn't know... and as a result i picked myself apart and second guessed everything that i did and said, trying to figure out why they were ignoring me (or if they even actually were).
Basically, if you want to ghost people, fine. I can't stop you. But i want you to know that 9 times out of 10, it hurts them more than just dealing with the conflict in a straightforward way. So if you actually care about the person at all, it should be worth it to either fix the problem, or at least give them some closure. "
5050,isfp,"As an ISFP myself, I believe your ISFP friend did it to hurt you deliberately. But it takes two hands to clap so idk you must've done something to trigger them somehow to want to hurt you that way.
I'm guilty of ghosting my ""friends"" when it comes to burning my bridges. Not trying to justify my way of breaking up a friendship btw."
5051,isfp,"Im not talking about forgiveness... dont make assumptions. Relationships are give and take, and  just randomly deciding that you're bored of someone and ditching them and hurting them is asshole behavior. "
5052,isfp,"Again entitled that you think you deserve everyone‚Äôs time around you. Also no, most of the time people cut off ties with others is actually because they start to annoy them and not because they are just bored of you and were using you. 
I can safely tell you there are plenty of people out there that arent children that needed to be taught how to behave in an non annoying way. Instead of always needing people to tell you why you are annoying how about you figure it out yourself and start becoming a more likable person from there? Maybe then people wont just ditch you then. Because its never your own problem huh? Its always the other people that are the assholes lol"
5053,isfp,"My friend gave me volume one of the No Game No Life light novel that the anime was based off of. He had no idea that it was a novel and not a manga which he explained almost apologetically, making it that much more special to me. Not expecting a gift from him at all, it feels so good knowing what he wanted to give me, and frankly I was already excited to read the novel.  For something that's only like $12 on Amazon, I'm almost surprised that it turned out to be my favorite gift this year."
5054,isfp,"some facts about him:

he enjoys playing guitar and writing songs and really enjoys it when he masters a hard song on guitar
he has a bandcamp page and the design of it is really important to him
he dislikes sports but is good at them when he actually tries
he constantly switches between ""energetic and weird"" and ""chill and smart"" 
he used to dance as a hobby when he was younger
art is his life
he's very lazy at school, although he's incredibly good in the subjects he's interested in
he can seem like an intp at times, dunno why
he wants to be different from everyone else
he feels everything very intensely so when he's happy he's REALLY REALLY HAPPY YAY and when he's sad he almost wants to kill himself
"
5055,isfp,"Okay, art and music doesn't revolve around our lives. Those are just stereotypes. Not. Facts.
See if he's reserved when it comes to strangers, thinks before acting, watches instead of doing, etc.. That's the Introverted part. Is he more detailed-oriented and in the moment or big-picture-oriented and looks a lot into the future? Being more detailed-oriented and in the moment is the Sensing part. Does he put his feelings over the logical reason? If yes, then he's a feeler, which is the Feeling part. And lastly, does he keep up a routine and is organized? Perceivers, which is the P of ISFP's, tend to be flexible and adaptable, but lack a routine.
Hoped it helped!"

5057,isfp,"I have always loved nature in weird ways. I just wanted to share and see if you guys have any nature observing / loving habits too! 
I've always been a 'rock turner' or a 'log flipper' I feel a certain sense of gleeful excitement to peer in to this little world that's been hidden by stones and logs and just being able to check out what's going on. I often look at the ground while I walk, always checking out for bugs in my path to save, I have a penchant for trying to save worms from drowning and herding caterpillars and snails across the side walk if they are on the path and might get stepped on. 
I've recently begun looking at getting a bee-hive and am really excited about that! In general I just love being outside, especially in a foresty area in all the cool green and having just recently got a dog am really enjoying having a good reason just to lay outside beneath a tree for hours on end.
What about you guys? how do you express your special love of nature?"
5058,isfp,"Experiencing nature and wildlife is my greatest joy in life. I love exploring for hours and photographing my discoveries.
Here is a collection of animal and insect photos by me."
5059,isfp,"Same here.  I love animals more than I do people lol.  I hate seen any kind of animals (even bugs) in pain or dying.  I've hit 2 birds while driving before and I cried both times (I'm a 26 year old man).  When spiders or wasps build their homes on my house, I don't knock them down or harm them.  My parents and friends think I'm weird because of this."
5060,isfp,"I love the universe of small stuff like insects, they are aliens to me, i don't even kill some spiders i have at home coz i love to feed them.
Maybe you would like this subreddit, it's one of my favs https://www.reddit.com/r/Entomology/"
5061,isfp,"Yes. I always like to imagine the goings ons in the lives of insects and animals I see. It's always so interesting to see these little bros going about their days. 
It's not just animals. I love looking at plants and feeling river water running in between my toes. I love feeling the sun and the wind on my skin. Really, I just love how alive everything feels. 
Except for mosquitos and ticks. They're jerks. "
5062,isfp,"There is something about being in nature that is completely and utterly calming. Maybe it's the feeling of being alone and in touch with your surroundings and yourself. I live in the city now, but always long to have more nature."
5063,isfp,"I argree. When I go out or travelling on holidays I just can't stop myself taking pictures of nature, like hundread of them. And when I study, I feel like Bio is the only STEM subject I like. It is fascinating to learn more about the world around us."
5064,isfp,"Overall I don't really mind them, and irl they're pretty nice usually, but damn, whenever a conflict arises or when I'm just in a bad mood in general, Fe is probably my worst enemy, function-wise.
ExFJs seem to give off a ""you're dead to me"" kinda vibe if you do anything wrong, and it's also like they truly don't care about anything from within, it's kinda like they're just doing an act or something to get accepted.
IxFJs (especially INFJs) seem to take Fi not seriously at all, like sometimes when you mean something and talk about something passionately, they're just sitting there with their eyes closed and grinning, as if they're saying ""haha, so funny, these people"". It's incredibly patronizing in a way.
ExTPs are to me the worst of the bunch (since I'm speaking as an ISFP, of course), they seem to take a very... systematic approach to Fe, from my experience. It's kinda like they keep regurgitating a manual containing instructions on how to be seen as normal and caring, and really artificially apply that to other people (constantly trying to be nice in a bit of an awkward way, constantly justifying everything with ""I did it for the others"", caring only about the tribe but never themselves), it's kinda like how extremely religious people basically take every word from the Bible and apply it to life, perhaps without even thinking about it themselves, they just do it. But the worst part is definitely when they're unhealthy and get all aggressive on you, and use Fe to gauge your reaction to their attacks, as a form of amusement.
IxTPs are probably the easiest to handle out of this list since they have inferior Fe. I do find it really annoying that even though they don't use Fe often, sometimes it does pop up and it becomes basically a very mild version of the ExTP's Fe.
Overall, Fe users are pretty decent, but sometimes.. /rant"
5065,isfp,"yes. sevetdly. all the time. INFJs are the worst. had one bitching me out as they k ew i was outside a door listening. was miles away. then they bitched me out cause they were too lazy to unlock door. the ""i am empath, your intense emotion makes me wanna throw up and i know how you feel why u say i wrong u are evil.""
fuck infj
fuck those guys
-infp"
5066,isfp,"Yes. Although it‚Äôs difficult for me to separate whether it‚Äôs the expression of their Fe or their Ti (which are intrinsically linked) that I find so off-putting. I perceive them to be illogical and difficult to cooperate with on an intimate level.
My parents, husband, mother in law, and many other people close to me throughout my life have been Fe/Ti users, and at this point I‚Äôve more or less lost hope that I‚Äôll ever really be understood by anyone who isn‚Äôt some angsty misanthrope (like me) behind a computer screen.
Better than nothing I guess."
5067,isfp,"I don't understand, how is Fe bad when you are in a bad mood. I thought Fe allowed the other person to get what you are feeling. Seems like a good quality. What negative comes from it? 
Obviously, as a INTP, I'm a low Fe user, I think I just use it for awareness."
5068,isfp,"The IxFJ faking Fi thing - can you elaborate on that?  Your description sounds a little like the opposite of what Fe would be.
Not judging because you might be totally accurate, but mocking somebody who's speaking about their passion is simply rude, Fe or not.   Could it be your perception of what the person is doing?
Asking because I'm wondering if I come off that way to Fi users.  I genuinely enjoy when somebody shares their interests and share their joys, especially ISFPs.  I just wish I could get more of it, y'all are so secretive."
5069,isfp,"ENFP here but, from my perspective, you nailed why INFJs also kind of drive me nuts.  I know they are supposed to compliment my type well but they just don't seem to get Fi at all.
Their Fe also seems high strung and they can have a way of taking certain things way too seriously.
E.g.
ENFP: ""Of course Hitchbot would only make it to Philly...""
INFJ: ""I can't believe what happened to that robot!  Humanity is doomed!""  ::launches Into Ted talk on how America is the worst country in the world::"
5070,isfp,"YES. Jesus Christ. I absolutely hate most Fe users, except the xxTPs. 
INFJs especially irk me. I find some of them have a very ""holier-than-thou"" attitude and it's almost as if they look down on us. ISFJs, I usually don't really find anything in common with them.
ESFJs are usually the type of people who annoy me but can be really nice. (my dad is a textbook ESFJ, for example) ENFJs, hm, I had an ENFJ friend who was the popular artsy girl type, but there was something ""distant"" about her. Like, I felt something was really off, like you described. An act. It was a weird feeling.
I had an ESTP frenemy (whom I thought was ESFJ at first, but looking back she was extremely Se-dom) who was absolute hell. This girl was the type to have a shit ton of ""friends"" (those friendships were really shallow... I was her only close friend, she had another ""close friend"" before me who literally disappeared when I came around). Obsessed with food, her own appearance, sex, materialistic as fuck, totally lacking empathy for anyone (but still being nice to waiters and whoever wasn't part of her inner circle! Very systematic, like you said), stomped over boundaries, and would go from hot to cold for no reason and then yell at me for the shallowest reasons like not opening a door or sitting on her bed.
ENTPs, on the other hand, are kind of my ideal. I noticed I badly want to be one of them. I kind of am an ENTP-wannabe in a sense. 
Nothing to say about IxTPs. I used to type as ISTP and sometimes I feel I might actually be one, and INTPs are usually like ISFJs, I don't frequently find anything to talk about with them. They just don't click with me for the most.   "
5071,isfp,"Hmmm, that's about the last thing I'd ever expect anyone to say about Ti. But I agree on the ""it‚Äôs difficult for me to separate whether it‚Äôs the expression of their Fe or their Ti"" thing."
5072,isfp,"To an Fi-user, I can see how Fe might seem bad.  As an ISFJ, I've noticed that Fi-users seem to feel things so deeply - when my xSFP friends start crying, I really, really don't know how to handle it.  I know what to say when my Fe-using friends start crying, but when an xSFP is upset, it suddenly strikes me just how different Fi-Te and Fe-Ti are. I always feel like I'm just making things worse with them.  Even if I do understand how they're feeling and find it easy to empathize with them, I still feel like we're levels apart on the emotional atmosphere when they're sad about something.  Their emotions are super, super, internal.  When I'm sad about something, I'll cry and either try to rationalize the situation because I don't want to be sad anymore, or I'll feel kind of removed from what I'm crying about?  It's like I feel it, but I don't feel it."
5073,isfp,"you are completely on point here.
We do grate but I make it worse than it needs to by responding to immaturity.
i am making an effort to stop blasting infj  in respect for my jnfj friends who are very tolerant. 
in any case this is what mostly fasvinates me with cognitive stacks....I like to know people have a method I may be able to perceive as rational even if I perceive it as asinine or rude.   
I think my main problem with people i am lamblasting as infj is their inability to return that respect to ke.   And noone is obligated to.   I need to learn to be mindful and adult as otherwise disrespect multiples rather than stacks.  
Our stacks designed to grate but honestly we can get along as ling as we stay mindful....and I am tired   of not accounting for how I might encourage some disrespect.
I hope I havent made you feel uncomfortable."
5074,isfp,"Their logic is very circular and fueled by Fe. Or it is when it comes to personal matters anyway. My ISTP husband is a wizard with figuring out how machines work, yet can barely communicate with me on a basic level when it comes to justifying a belief, or a rule he‚Äôs wanting to impose. (Not that he‚Äôs bossy, but we have children so you kinda need some behavioral guidelines, etc.) 
The most basic fallacy I see with him is stating something as a fact when in reality it is actually just a belief of his. Then, when presented with overwhelming evidence to the contrary of whatever he‚Äôs claiming, he shuts out all incoming data - no matter how factual or reasonable - and angrily storms off, goes into ‚Äúmaking personal attacks‚Äù mode, or some other method of running away from reality.
My experience with xNFJs has been similar in that regard except instead of getting angry or belligerent they tend to ignore, cry, or self victimize to avoid admitting a claim they‚Äôre making is actually invalid, and nothing more than something they want to believe."
5075,isfp,"Whenever I find a passion or a hobby of sorts, I get really into it and have this desire to get very good at it. Not world class good, but the best I can possibly be. It's almost as if I'm competing against myself to always do better than the last time.
What is this, perfectionism? Am I just competitive? Has this ever happened to you?"
5076,isfp,"When I'm good at something and enjoy it, I usually get pretty into it and strive to be better than other people. Maybe not the BEST but I get kind off competitive.
If I'm only okay but know I could be better with practice...I'm usually not motivated enough unless I'm sure I could excel. It's kind of a problem because unless I learn quickly and excel quickly, I get bored and lose interest."
5077,isfp,"Yup, definitely. ISFPs tend to be extremely competitive when it comes to activities that we're passionate about. I fell in love with running my junior year of high school and joined the cross country and track team my senior year and told myself I'd train until I was the fastest runner on the team. Ended up being the third fastest guy on our team, so yes, ISFPs definitely have a 'hidden' competitive edge when it comes down to our passions. "
5078,isfp,"Yep. I used to, and still do sometomes, have the mindset of either, ""Why do it if I'm not good at it?"" or ""I only enjoy things I'm good at."" I truly enjoy painting - but I just like the action, the motion, the way the paint looks and feels. The paintings are crap. I take month-long breaks from it, with my brushes and canvas in the closet, before I want to do it again more than I don't want to be frustrated.
I also get very angry with my husband because I'm not really better than him at anything. He reads faster and has more reading comprehension. He's better at video games - we could be clones of each other's characters, he'd still do more DPS or HPS or aggro or leveling than me, and I'm really not sure how. I can cook better than he can, and I have a better sense of colors, but he also takes his steaks burnt and is almost colorblind, so those don't really count. 
I am both a perfectionist and incredibly competitive. It's difficult to master."
5079,isfp,"yeah similar / if I don't enjoy or care about something then I won't care how I rank versus others, but in anything I'm at all passionate about, I can't help but get viciously competitive to the point of extreme stress;
example, for classes I enjoy, I'll study for hours upon hours to ensure that I have the top marks; for classes I dislike, I'll be content with something as low as a C"
5080,isfp,"It's about skill-rotations, optimizing synergies between abilities and paying attention to the hp of your target so as not to fire off an ability that will overkill it; which would spell lost dps in the grand scheme of things.
Just marshal your Te when analyzing this stuff and you'll do great."
5081,isfp,"Maybe I just love painting, but I cannot live in an apartment/house without painting the walls a comfortable color. Unlike a lot of people I've met, I cannot stand beige being the default color for walls; it's so boring and uncomfortable. For instance, when the walls in my room were beige, I couldn't stand being in my room, I absolutely had to get out, but ever since painting them green (shire green to be exact :P) I find it difficult to leave my room once I get off work, it just FEELS better to be in my room. Do any other ISFPs distinctly feel different 'vibes' with certain colors? "
5082,isfp,"YES. My bedroom used to be very boring. Neutral colors, some lame jungle animal wallpaper... okay for a kid but not okay for a teenager. I peeled it all off and painted it a dark blue. My parents complained every step of the way and told me I wouldn't like it. Of course, they were wrong and I love it, and in the end they admitted it did look pretty good.
TL;DR Never question an ISFP's decorating/fashion sense."
5083,isfp,"Yes! My first college apartment was unbearably boring with the plain white walls and seemed like it was lacking so much character. With friends I covered my walls with photos and made things out of paint samples to liven the place up, and also covered the inside of our front door with quotes everyone liked."
5084,isfp,I think walls are my favorite things. 50% of what I buy/do related to walls. I spent hours yesterday looking at paint stencils and swatches for future projects! I really cannot stand a plain wall. Paint and command strips are absolute necessities living in an apartment! Especially since I like to redecorate A LOT. 
5085,isfp,"AHH yes!! Haha this is so extremely accurate I saved this to my favorite posts. 
When I was little, I made my ISTJ dad help me paint my room magenta. He thought it was a waste of time and money so he painted it back to white a little before we moved out. In our new house, he let me paint my walls dark purple. I'm also obsessed with dark reds. 
Anything with rich color is a good thing, IMO. I really love visually stimulating colors and patterns from India so my room sort of emulates those colors. 
Also, going on a tangent (but what ISFP doesn't?) my INFP roommate had deemed me interior decorator of our place. And it's literally color and Christmas lights everywhere. I can't help myself. I'm so stylish. "
5086,isfp,"When I lived in my mom's house, my step-father(a maintenance man) painted our kitchen this(godawful) sunshine yellow(that looked like someone peed on our walls.) I helped and loved it, so I asked if I could paint my room. They said okay, but wouldn't ever help me move the furniture - I was about 12 or 13 and my dresser and bed were very heavy. I painted two walls and moved on, but they were pea green and supercool. I still had paint left over, so I painted half the bathroom green, left the other half white. Then, with primer, I did white handprints on the green half and green handprints on the white half. My little brother, about 2 or 3 at the time, helped and loved it. I perfected the art of positioning my hand so the lack of paint in the middle of my palm was shaped like a heart. :D It was amazing.
I now live in an apartment where I can't paint. So I do what I did before I painted my room - I buy pretty things(fabric, wrapping paper, whatever I like) and pin it to my walls. My daughter has a blanket or two to detract from the blank white walls, and my living room has a Chinese dragon puppet and a Pokemon poster and I'm going to the fabric store soon to pretend to sew, so I'll be getting something shiny and sultry and sexy for my room. :D"
5087,isfp,"Yeah, I feel ya on the whole checking account thing. Personally, I'm absolutely terrible at managing my money because when I get paid I'm constantly thinking about all the things I can buy now! Hah, it's a really bad habit that I need to break out of, but it's hard. Can't wait until I have my OWN place so I can paint the bathroom, kitchen, living room etc."
5088,isfp,"Absolutely agree with the TL;DR :P I've never considered myself much of an artist per se, but I discovered rather recently I'm great at decorating rooms, which is purdy cool, I guess haha. Great to see someone else feels the same way as I do about colors!"
5089,isfp,"That's awesome, and it sounds a lot like my good friends' apartment in Auburn. They're art majors, and their walls are covered in polaroid pictures, paintings, drawings and all that good stuff. While it is painted a neutral color, it feels really unique and comfortable in their place."
5090,isfp,"I agree with you 100%. It's so much fun painting rooms different and ALIVE colors because you're literally transforming the feeling and atmosphere of the room; and while colors do make rooms feel better, decorating them is the second half to actually completing it. I like entering a room and feeling a unique synergy, if you know what I mean. When decorating a room of yours, you're putting your soul into it as you go, putting pictures, medals, tapestries, vinyls, etc on the wall make it more original and comfortable."
5091,isfp,"Masturbating once every day or two is completely normal and healthy. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs an average amount. It is true that unhealthy S could lead to indulging in sensual activities such as drugs or heavy masturbation. But once a day isn‚Äôt an issue, especially if it isn‚Äôt causing any problems."
5092,isfp,"Before i masturebate alot everyday when i go to the bath room in my bed and while watching porn that is daily basis 
But now i tried to controll it to the extent that no jaculation for a week or if im pre occupied at something 
But after the pleasure there is a sensation of satisfaction especially after orgasms (result of a day or  two or a week of chastity hehehe)"
5093,isfp,"I usually only masturbate twice a week. Right now I'm abstaining for a month so I can document the physical changes. and mental changes too, but I doubt there will be any unlike if an addict were to quit for a month (but who knows, that's the point of the experiment)
Edit: typo"
5094,isfp,"As in physically? Im not fit my bmi is obese but i do cycling  to work everyday im also an adult 31 already
Sometimes i wonder if this is normal as i always look ladies on thier boobies and assess then my imagination fukin kicks in"
5095,isfp,"A lot of people will agree that humans should have complete control over their own bodies while they are alive. How about after death? Is it better to use those bodies (for organ donation etc.) for the benefit of the living?
Should there be an opt-out instead of opt-in for organ donation? How about in tricky situations where the person died really early before deciding?"
5096,isfp,"Sacred? No. But you've got to handle them with respect of course. I reckon an opt-out scenario is best. Many people don't think about whether they want to be an organ donor, some do but are indifferent or just too lazy to change their registration and others don't want to think about it because they are scared. Family is often faced with this question when a relative dies who has not registered and many people say no, some say yes, but many people regret their decision afterwards. No wonder, because making such an enormous decision on someone else's behalf in such a turbulent moment is impossible. 
So, making organ donation a default for people over 18 or 21 because of all these reasons, and more, is a good thing, I would say. It forces people to face this question and to make a conscious decision. I think that is good. We need donated organs so we can't just keep on not registering for whatever reason. Do it to save other people or to spare your loved ones such a difficult choice, or spare the doctors having to ask your family. And please, don't feel guilty if you don't want to be an organ donor. That's your every right. Put please register so as to make things clear and to prevent chaos after your death. That helps everybody.
I would also make underage people organ donors by default, and let parents or guardians change this to a no if they or the child are uncomfortable with this. Children are of course an even more touchy subject, but child organs are in even greater need than adult organs because adult organs simply are too big for children. And, child organ donations are just the most important because we can give these kids their childhood and possibly their whole life back."
5097,isfp,"I think bodies should be handled with respect, but I do think that the organ donor aspect should really be an opt-out kind of thing. If they died and didn't opt-out, donate. Even then, most bodies are not apt to donate depending on the cause of death. 
Myself, I'd like to be buried in the ground under a seed or something. Go back to nature, not buried in an expensive box wearing expensive clothes and makeup, or toasted to become toxic ash. It makes no sense."
5098,isfp,"I like absurdist contradictions/scenarios.  
What makes me laugh is things like these royal art lodge things. they're a bit precious, but it's self-aware."
5099,isfp,i like this one the most 
5100,isfp,"To start off I'm a 19m that's currently on a summer break. About a month ago, I met this girl, and she peaked my interest. To my suggestion she took the MBTI and realized she was an ISFP.
From the second time we met, she asked me if I was single-as I am, and I wasn't surprised since we can talk about anything and the conversation will just go on. At this phase we just were really good friends.
Four days ago, over the phone, she was somewhat flirting and 'defining' us, when her battery went off and ended the call. She sent me a couple of messages later saying ""Sorry"" twice-she does that a lot which I find cute, but I only responded with closing sentences and a ""no worries"".
Ever since, I stopped texting her, because I wanted to get some self reflection. I didn't want speed things up a bit as I tend to do, but she hasn't texted since.
Prior to that, we've been talking every other day or even everyday, but I'm not sure how define us. Were so different on so many levels yet so in-sync. We haven't brought up relationships other than her asking me if I was single and casual flirting. 
Should I talk to her, push ahead and go for it. Any ideas on what you'd expect as an ISFP or person. Am I missing something, and care to share any experiences."
5101,isfp,"I've been with my ENTP for almost 5 years now and it's great! I was the one who went after him, but if you're worried she'll never hit you back up, you can invite her to do something fun with you. Don't just text her all like ""Hey..."" like you expect her to explain why she went aloof, idk. Be excited about something that you want her to experience with you and invite her to it. :) We like to experience things and have fun. Maybe she got tired of just talking? Or maybe she's also just trying to play it cool. I still say invite her to a fun experience with you like a date."
5102,isfp,"First off, you don't seem to be trying to use MBTI for a ""how 2 mak her luvv meee?"" cheat code, so congrats on being a decent person :D
Unfortunately, I don't think you're missing anything. There's no way around taking the plunge and asking her out! Straightforward, deep breath, ""Hey would you like to go [something that is obviously a date] with me?"""
5103,isfp,"Yo! Stay in contact. If she didn't want to talk to you, chances are, she just wouldn't talk to you. Suddenly cutting conversation off is a bad idea as it can lead to her feeling dejected or that she did something wrong. "
5104,isfp,"I'm very easily triggered by trivial things like people saying they love something I hate or vice versa, I just can't help it. Nothing else pisses me off more, actually. I realize it's useless and pointless, and I don't even get why it pisses me off so much in the first place, but I've always been like that.
How do you do it?"
5105,isfp,"I have the same problem. It helped me to realize that the person doing these things probably doesn't have the same reaction to ""love"" ""hate"" type phrases, and therefore would not find that kind of thing offensive. Therefore, they wouldn't expect you too either. Some people just say everything in a very intense way, and may not even feel as strongly as they're coming off. "
5106,isfp,"Let them have their opinion. Everyone is different, but we're all human. As long it doesn't physically affect you, who cares what other people think? Occasionally it's good to engage a bit with them and try to understand their perspective, but it's also important to just learn to accept that not everyone is the same as you."
5107,isfp,Explore why you want others to have the same opinions/tastes as you. Does it make you feel accepted and validated when they are in agreement with you? Why is your value placed on others validating your own likes and dislikes?
5108,isfp,"Let me answer why you care so much, ISFP's have inferior Te. This makes ISFP's sensitive to the opinions and thoughts of others. This can also affect you in other ways, such as making you indecisive, or ineffective in bringing your ideas to fruition. Maybe you wish to become more effective at organizing your environment and becoming more responsible in certain areas. Oh another big thing is your social status. This is commonly  very important to Te types. With Te being in your inferior, I imagine something like 10,000 people talking about they think negatively of you would be your worse nightmare, understand that this is part of your inferior function and it's a struggle you will have to deal with throughout life. Every type has different type of fear insecurity, this happens to be yours"
5109,isfp,"I‚Äôve always been intrigued by the idea of having a personal uniform, like Steve Jobs. I love aesthetics and design, but I feel like choosing clothes in the morning is such a hassle. I would wear my navy blue San Francisco sweat shirt (that fits perfectly) everyday. I already wear skinny jeans, vans, and dark gray or black nail polish (almost!) every day. I like to dress nicely, I.e. stuff needs to fit well and suit my style, but overall, I don‚Äôt care much, and tend to put more effort into my hair/makeup."
5110,isfp,I have just noticed that I often worry about making sure my beliefs are justified to others.  I know that we ISFPs take our lives very seriously and can hold our belief systems very close.  Can anyone else relate?
5111,isfp,"Okay, I commented before, but maybe I should also actually share how I deal with it!


I feel the need to justify myself because I worry how people will react if they don't feel I'm justified.


Most of the time, though, people don't react negatively when I fail to justify.


So whenever I feel ""need-to-justify anxiety,"" I try to compose the justification in my head, but refrain from saying anything. That way, I feel safely prepared for potential criticism, but I'm not stammering to justify myself every time.

"
5112,isfp,"All. The. Fucking. Time.
It's not that I worry what other people think...it's more about reaffirming to myself. I know other people don't care most of the time and I know I'm being obnoxious...but I can't seem to stop myself."
5113,isfp,"This place is fucking dead, but I think we should try and revive it. Out of sixty people, at least ten should want to have a conversation,  so what do you like to do?
I love writing. Creative writing. And Pink Floyd."
5114,isfp,Been in a funk for a few years here so I don't have many current hobbies but I still love movies and music.  I usually stick with rock n roll and its cousins.  Foo Fighters are probably my favorite band but AIC and RHCP are up there as well.  I used to write songs back in the early days of the net using midi programs like Cakewalk.  Hate to admit this but I'm still playing WoW and liking it.  I also enjoy coming up with story ideas although I rarely flesh them out aaaaaaaaaaand....I play with Lego blocks regularly.
5115,isfp,"As a young child, I loved to play videogames. All I had were Nintendo consoles, from Game Boy to the GBA and GBA SP, and from the N64, to Gamecube, to Wii.
However, when I was 5 years old, my cousins bought us a Japanese PS1 with pirated PS1 games, and they were fake discs compacted in CD cases with fake sleeves. Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 worked and there was a PS1 version of Pajama Sam 3 (which amused me since HE would never think of doing that) but some other games glitched up, refusing to work. Luckily, I could still ace If You Were Here With Me with an AA grade and destroy the ice cream truck in Suburbia.
Growing up, games have change remarkably. Just 9-10 years ago we were presented with blocky graphics, now game companies could make advanced 3D models of starships, humans, animals, buildings, nature, and high rising structures. 
Prebuilt PCs became less expensive so I joined the gaming scene on there, discovering Indie games and the modding scene of PC games. I enjoy a good amount of Half Life 2 mods, which all challenge the Source Engine (the game engine Valve created for Half Life 2, and it's episodes, along with Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, Counter Strike Sourceand ) to excellent use. I've tried the Hammer tool in the Source Software Development Kit...and it's pretty long work. Texturing, making rooms, lighting, plopping in models...it's hard work.
I'm currently going away from console gaming and into PC gaming while enjoying some unpopular games on the Wii. The Indie gaming scene is also growing on the PS3 too, so I might as well buy one if possible."
5116,isfp,"I like to spend my days surfing the internet but on the odd occasion, I like to have my group of friends over and hold what we call a ""gameathon"". Everyone brings their games console and a TV, we line them up and play all night. Amazing."
5117,isfp,"I like comic books, ""real"" novels, and eating. I really like eating. I spend most of my money on food, but mainly because I don't spend much time at home. I feel... displaced vis a vis my family, but I don't hate them or anything. 
Once I move out officially into my own place next month I'll be buying groceries like an adult. I may see if I can get some government support for food money while I'm still at university. Even if you aren't a fan of such government programs, you may as well take advantage of them while they exist; that money goes to waste if it isn't used either way. But I digest...
I'm not muscular, but I like to work out. Most of it is cardio (marial artist here, Kwanmukan Karate, a mixed style invented in the '40s when Japan occupied Korea)
I like a wide variety of music, and much of it may be considered esoteric.
I'm in one of those swings wherein I don't really care about amorous endeavors, which invariably will lead me to begin one (why do they only happen when I'm trying not to? It's like a cosmic slap in the face.)
I like to read about religion and philosophy. I've recently come to love Taoism as a philosophy.
I like foreign language and culture. I'm an International Relations major at Kent State. It's mainly learning about foreign cultures, government, and other organizations like NATO and UNICEF and how our own (USA) interacts with them.
I play Magic: the Gathering and I'm obsessed with the increasingly popular A Song of Ice and Fire epic.
Tl;DR Nah,no recap just... too long lol"
5118,isfp,"Hm, lets see. First off, I am a PC gamer. Mostly MMORPGs. At the moment I am playing Guild Wars 2. I've had a computer around as long as I remember and I find that its a great way to meet people and explore the worlds (and minds) of the developers and artists. I can't see myself ever not playing some kind of game as a hobby.
My other passion is horseback riding. I've ridden for 14 years (I'm 24) and have loved horses my entire life. I finally got a horse when I was 15 and competed in three-day eventing quite actively. I was pretty talented and trained a bunch of horses for other people as well. Nothing since has topped the feeling this gave me. I was forced to sell my horse to go to college (which I still have not been able to finish) and have not ridden actively in several years. I miss it tremendously and wish there was a way to pursue my passion as a career without leaving my beloved pets behind to go to some random state as a working student.
Besides that I LOVE gardening, hiking, good food, any animals and pets. I LOVE music and seriously cannot go a day without hearing some form of music. I prefer electronic music (mainly dubstep-like music such as Seven Lions) and rock (death metal, grunge, classic rock, whatever)"
5119,isfp,"I read your post, and you sound exactly like me...minus the horse riding/competing part.  I love music so much, I can't go a day without listening to music.  My favorite artist is Green Day and Eminem.  
I enjoy the adventuring feel hiking gives me.  Like as if I am traversing the land, discovering new things.  I am not a college student, but a mere high school student.  
I enjoy reading, studying Entomology, studying psychology, and writing.  I will write anything from short stories to rap.  
Btw, my name is Chris and I live in New Jersey."
5120,isfp,"I'm trying to decide on a college major. Right now I'm leaning towards engineering or maybe computer science. I've always excelled in math (which I think is an uncommon ISFP trait) and I actually don't mind taking science courses. From what I've read, engineering isn't really a good fit for ISFPs. I'm just curious to see if there are any ISFPs in the engineering field and if you guys can give any insights on how its going for you"
5121,isfp,"may I point out that you are posting this on a website filled with engineers, especially ones computer related. So your gonna get a lot of us :P Im still in high school, Im probably going to university to get a computer and mathematical science degree. However I think I will go down the website design route of the degree, rather than software engineering"
5122,isfp,"I am an ENFJ dating an ISFP and while I hear Fe and Fi can clash, I really like being the one to initiate and encourage communication. I just worry about crossing lines sometimes. of course everyone is different, but where do you guys draw the line?"
5123,isfp,"It's hard to say, I personally don't know myself well enough to pinpoint where that line is. But I think the person you're dating would respond well if you asked them this directly. I don't know how comfortable you are with playing it by ear like that, but as an ISFP I would appreciate that kind of vulnerability. Maybe it would encourage them to respond in kind"
5124,isfp,"It's a balance. You'll want to give the ISFP a prod, then back off for a bit to let them sort out their thoughts, then if they don't decide to approach you, lead by example then start from the top.
For me, if I don't talk to someone for a week, it just becomes less and less likely that I'll approach them, depending on how close we are.   
ISFP's don't like to be pressured or put on the spot, so instead of focusing on having them attempt to say whatever's on their mind, focus on giving them a situation or environment where they'll feel comfortable doing so. 
If I can comfortably sit in silence with someone, eventually I'll work out some way to articulate what I want to say to them. Often I'd be more than happy to open up to someone, if only I had the time and space to work out how to do so."
5125,isfp,"I'm saying subtle flirting like some touches here and there, maybe saying some playful things. Nothing too excessive. Would you guys actually register it as flirting? And if you do, how would you react to people you like vs people you are not interested in? Would be nice to get some ISFP males' input, but anything is welcome :)"
5126,isfp,"I can only speak for myself, but as a female ISFP, here are my thoughts:
I think too little of myself/am too humble to ever realize someone's actually flirting with me. I will always assume they're being friendly, because How embarrassing would it be to assume they were flirting with me, and who am I to assume their intentions?! Come on too strong when I'm not interested and I will (politely) run away and will never be heard or seen again. Coming on too strong when I'm interested? Nervous, polite giggles and internally thinking SAY SOMETHING BACK! QUICK! UUHHH HOW DO I DO THIS Most things could be seen as too fast/too soon to us, because we value our own comfort and space so much. I think the key is to communicate honestly about your intentions/interest in us, because even though ISFPs will be the last person to confront someone, it'll calm us down to know exactly what you're thinking.
I'm dating an ENTJ, and the reason why we're together is because he patiently waited for my walls to come down :)"
5127,isfp,"Male ISFP, I assume no one would ever be interested in me and never know if someone is flirting or likes me unless someone points it out and even then I typically don‚Äôt really believe them. It sucks really because I‚Äôm 23 and have never been in a relationship or done anything. I would like to but can never tell."
5128,isfp,"I am an ISFP male and I feel like I notice it most of the time, but I don't think I'm very good at flirting back. The only times I actively flirt is when I really like the other person and feel like there is good chemistry between us. If it's somebody I'm not sure about or I'm in an uncomfortable position to flirt(like at work) then I just try to be nice without being too playful
Somebody has been flirting with me for a while recently, and I try to flirt back a bit but I don't think we mesh that well, though it's hard to tell. I don't want to be in a relationship with them, but I'd be fine with something more than just friends - though I don't know how they feel about it or how I'd talk to them about that. "
5129,isfp,As an isfp female i can tell immediately when I'm being flirted with but im not smooth enough to flirt back so i freeze up and get very tense and nervous. Ive never been able to flirt successfully at all :P
5130,isfp,"Weirdly enough, this is exactly what I'm feeling at the moment. Thanks for your insight anyway!"
5131,isfp,I second that as an ISFP male. What tinysoka said is pretty accurate. Sometimes I can recognize flirting is happening but I over think it then convince myself that wouldn't happen and they were just being friendly.
5132,isfp,"Looking back I see I rambled, I'm glad I could help somehow lol! =)
  edit: it's my opinion that confessing outright will DEFINITELY speed things up, otherwise the ISFP will wait and never say anything.......ever"
5133,isfp,"The ui of this subreddit is reassuring and welcoming.
I've made the right choice.
So my wonderful people what triggered your thoughts today?
Today I crammed my intellectual ability in to a essay last minute and I still got a great response from my professor! "
5134,isfp,"First up before I go on a bit of a rant, nice work on the essay. Winging it and pulling it off is always a good feeling. Anyone can a HD. But only a hero can get it by doing the entire thing 5 minutes before class.
Anyway, because its related and don't really wanna make a post about it I'll just do it here. I toe the line between ISTP and ISFP. And even a bit between them and the INTP/INFP. Basically, both just from my experience with myself and from the test results I'm about 50/50 between feeling and thinking and only slightly skewed towards sensing over intuition.
And not in a good way. I'm the ISFP without creativity, or the ISTP without all the good parts from thinking (planning mainly). A bit of an idealist while recognizing that my ideals aren't reality and never will be. 
Anybody else feel like this? I get the feeling I'm taking these personality things a bit too much like they are set in stone and everyone fits one, but still. It'd be nice to know there are other people as lost as me."
5135,isfp,"Dude, all tests on the internet are inaccurate. To correctly type yourself, you need to verify your type by studying into the functions. On the internet, I get typed as ESTP, ISFP, ISTP and INTP. But using the functions, I was able to type myself as an ISTP."
5136,isfp,"Play dota and despair over terrible ideas/plots/cliches/writing in stories I read. I can recognize poor writing, I just can't make it better.
I'd be a critic if I had the slightest interest in throwing my opinions in peoples faces.
Also internet arguments.
Edit: That all made me sound slightly worse than I actually am. I can recognize good (In my opinion) writing too. I love getting lost in other people's creativity."
5137,isfp,"well anyone can use logic, an ISFP can still act rationally, that doesn't make you an ISTP
if you really want there is a lot to understand about mbti. it sounds like you don't know much about it tbh which isn't a problem, unless you really enjoy psychology i suppose."
5138,isfp,"For a long time, I was sure that I was a T type, because I‚Äôm not very outwardly expressive. But looking more into the functions I realised that Fi is waaaaay more accurate for me than Ti. I still don‚Äôt really express myself visibly often, in fact sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm acting my real emotions like a play, just to show people that I appreciate something, because if I just let a natural reaction happen I would look uncaring for it.
So is this an ISFP thing? I think it might be an Fi thing in general."
5139,isfp,"It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre so concerned with being authentic (dominant Fi) that you focus too much on whether emotions you show are fake or forced, and then you just shut down to prevent coming across as a phony.
Get out of your head. I think the most genuine ISFP emotions are shown in the moment and almost always in person: abrupt laughter, a spontaneous hug, a blush, etc."

5141,isfp,"Honestly I just have no idea what any of the involved parts of MBTI are. It doesn't particularly interest me. I thought the eight pages on the ISFP were pretty cool and pretty spot on a couple of times though. It was a good read, and it lead me here so. Its a good thing."
5142,isfp,"hi, anyone you take a quick personality test https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test <-- (don't need to create an account on the site)
then take a survey on your music taste? https://goo.gl/forms/lzqPk8jGD6oYXEy22
Would be huge. Help me get preliminary validation for my hypothesis, hopefully I can post the results later on.
(I know it's not MTBI ¬Ø(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø)"
5143,isfp,"Cool! Let us know if there's any correlation. I'd be surprised if there is, but who knows!
I'm also curious if other ISFP people get similar scores on Big Five. I got:


Openness 80%


Conscientiousness 30%


Extraversion 43%


Agreeableness 90%


Neuroticism 73%


I think it was pretty accurate for me."
5144,isfp,"You Are Low in Openness to Experience
Your score for openness was low, at 55%. Openness describes a person‚Äôs tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to associate ideas and see relationships between things. Low scorers tend to see things more literally, and focus more on the practical, straightforward, and concrete.
People who are low in openness are typically:
Practical
Traditional
Conventional
Most comfortable in familiar surroundings
Low Openness scorers are more likely to be politically conservative and to spend their leisure time enjoying mainstream entertainment, including sports, movies, and pop music. They do not tend to be interested in art and usually avoid high-brow cultural activities like the opera or the ballet.
You Are Low in Conscientiousness
Your score for conscientiousness was low, at 28%.
Conscientiousness describes a person‚Äôs ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. High scorers are organized and determined, and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked.
People who are low in Conscientiousness are usually:
Impulsive
Disorganized
Spontaneous
Carefree
People who are low in Conscientiousness are more likely to develop addictions of all kinds, as they have trouble resisting the impulse to engage in pleasurable activities. They also have more disorganized homes and offices. On the other hand, they tend to be more flexible and spontaneous, and do well in unpredictable environments where they must respond to constantly changing circumstances.
You Are Low in Extraversion
Your score for Extraversion was low, at 28%.
Extraversion describes a person‚Äôs inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others in order to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts tend to conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards.
People who are low in Extraversion tend to be:
Reserved
Independent
Quiet
Deliberate
Extraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal, especially a goal that involves other people. People who are high in Extraversion are thrilled by achievements like getting a promotion, landing a new mate, or receiving an award. People who are low in Extraversion do not experience the same ‚Äúhigh‚Äù from these experiences, and so do not put in as much effort to pursue them.
People who are low in Extraversion tend to be fairly independent, and do not need a lot of admiration or recognition from others in order to feel satisfied. They tend not to be interested in money or status, and would rather lead a life that is personally pleasing than one that gains them the attention of others.
You Are Moderate in Agreeableness
Your score for Agreeableness was moderate, at 60%.
Agreeableness describes a person‚Äôs tendency to put others‚Äô needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.
People who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people.
Your moderate score in Agreeableness indicates that you are fairly typical in the degree to which you balance your own interests with the interests of others. You are probably willing to sacrifice yourself for others some of the time, but you also watch out for yourself quite a bit.
You are Moderate in Neuroticism
Your score for Neuroticism was moderate, at 45%.
Neuroticism describes a person‚Äôs tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, some people are more prone to them than others.
This trait can be thought of as an alarm system. People experience negative emotions as a sign that something is wrong in the world. You may be in danger, so you feel fear. Or you may have done something morally wrong, so you feel guilty. However, not everyone has the same reaction to a given situation. High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger, sadness, and the like. Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on.
Your score indicates that you are fairly typical in your tendency to experience negative emotions. You probably feel sadness, worry, anger, and guilt about as much as the average person. You are neither overly reactive, nor especially resistant to the stresses of life."
5145,isfp,"Don't try to overthink it. Yes there is introversion and extroversion, but there is also ambiversion which is an in between. And it comes down to the situation. I enjoy people's company, and HATE being alone it stresses me out, I would much rather be hanging out with people than left to entertain myself (very much an extroverted feeling), but I can't stand large crowds, and I'm too awkward at starting conversations with strangers - although I have been known to but then struggle to keep it going of course (very much an introverted feeling).  
SO WHAT AM I?!?!?! An ambivert. boom . which means I'm an ISFP.... because I can't decide what I am and it just depends on my mood and my energy levels (which of course is your classic ISFP type)"
5146,isfp,"Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.
Here is the link to the survey

5147,isfp,"Error with questions 218 and 219 onwards. They both say ‚ÄúI remove clothing‚Äù as an example of flirting (now call me insane but I think that is). Unless my monitor is acting up, that‚Äôs quite a lot of questions with the same error. "
5148,isfp,"Pewdiepie. I know there‚Äôs a lot of talk over whether he actually is or not, but I definitely think so. His Fi is very strong. He has a lot of interests and is surprisingly artistic and aesthetic.
He also made a video a couple weeks ago talking about where he grew up, the sentimental value he has in stuff. Talks about how he was very introverted, and went to a university that he hated because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhim‚Äù, and he preferred the freedom of leaving for a shitty hot dog stand job. After watching that video, I don‚Äôt get how anyone couldn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an ISFP honestly.
Eh I don‚Äôt really watch him much but yeah, he‚Äôs a definite ISFP I think."
5149,isfp,"Yeah I do like him too. If you watch some of his more serious videos, rather than just reacting to memes his ISFP is very clear lol. In his vlogs he‚Äôs very introverted and shy, he has interests such as whiskey tasting (let‚Äôs not forget his fashion!) and he‚Äôs just an all round chill, humble nice guy."
5150,isfp,"Yeah me too lmao. I‚Äôve always thought of pewdiepie as someone I wanna have a nice, private convo with. He gets a lot of shit from media, and has a pretty stressed public life. But I know he‚Äôs a genuine guy and I‚Äôd love a 1-1 convo just about life. 
Anywayyy I gotta get back to work. Enjoy the rest of your day!"
5151,isfp,"I can appreciate particularly good traditional art, but I much prefer sculptures because I also make things with my hands.
I suppose its partially because I can't draw so I can't tell how much work was put in, I can only tell it looks nice."
5152,isfp,"When it comes to looking at art, I agree. For the most part it's boring and I usually only appreciate things with a practical side as well.
That being said, I do love the process of creating just about any kind of art. I just don't usually keep it because I don't want all the clutter afterwords"
5153,isfp,"As much as I like her music, I don't favor Rihanna. Eminem and Lady Gaga are both frequently recognized as ISFP's. Even this page types Lady Gaga and Eminem as ISFP. There is even explanations as to why Eminem and Lady Gaga are typed as ISFP's."
5154,isfp,"I even just joined Reddit today. 
Yesterday, at 31 years of age, I took that Myer-Briggs test for the first time and the result I got seemed just right. 
Maybe it has something to do with why I have been lurking on Reddit for the better part of a year. "
5155,isfp,"What has helped you? I am in place where my main concern is getting as healthy as I can for my son. Not just so I can give him the best childhood possible but also so I can help him have a healthy relationship with anxiety. I suspect he will be predisposed to having it, and also that nurture has a lot to do with how we turn out."
5156,isfp,"For me, what helped the most was finding hobbies and interests that force me out of my own head, while also making me feel fulfilled. For instance, I love rock climbing and if I don't want to fall off the rock I can't be worrying about whatever I'm anxious about at the moment. I just started getting into photography for the same reason. If you're able to get out of your head for even a little bit (even if you ha e to force it) it helps so much. With that, you can start branching out and getting control over the anxiety instead of it having all the control.
I hope that helped a little; if you ever wanna reach out through PM or anything, feel free. "
5157,isfp,"Fi doms (ISFP & INFP):
Well, can't say much about ISFPs, since it's kinda like talking about yourself. As for INFPs, I find them pretty nice, but the Ne makes them very different from ISFPs. They're also more accepting and open minded, it seems. Personally if someone rubs me the wrong way, I'll dislike them no matter the context or circumstances, but INFPs seem to always try and understand the other's viewpoint before making any judgements.
Fi aux-es (ESFP & ENFP)
Honestly, I really don't understand Fi aux. It seems like it's actually not there, and their users are just using Se or Ne nonstop. Heck, sometimes they even seem like ESTPs or ENTPs if they're being mean or serious.
Fi tertiaries (ISTJ & INTJ)
Pretty cool. It's kinda like Fi dom, but more in the background. For whatever reason Fi seems more subdued with ISTJs to me. It also seems like they can get even more intense when their Fi gets violated than Fi doms sometimes.
Fi inferiors (ESTJ & ENTJ)
This kinda confuses me. At first glance I'm like ""oh, they're Fi users too, cool."", but when you actually see them it's pretty much nonexistent. It's kinda like the PoLR Fi in ENTPs and ESTPs, but somehow different. Just odd."
5158,isfp,"As an ENFP, my Fi can be found easily when I'm talking about my social/political/economic values. I will fall apart literally if I'm forced to do anything that doesn't stimulate my Fi. Fi is what causes me to stick out, it's not conforming the way Fe is. Love of authenticity and hatred of tyranny is all based in my Fi values. When ENFPs ""stick up for what they believe in"" you bet there is a complex set of values that they are standing by with their Fi. "
5159,isfp,"My social anxiety is so bad that I have a hard time leaving the house. I can't do things that a normal person finds easy. Aka driving, working and other adult stuff. My anxiety is ruining my life. I turn 21 soon. "
5160,isfp,"I remember being your age and having the struggle of anxiety. I lived several years in utter fear and controlled by anxious feelings. I would drink and the following day everything would be even worse. I tried all sorts of pills and nothing really made me feel like the person I was deep inside. I really wish I knew what I know now back then. It makes me really happy when I can assist someone in their recovery from anxiety. 
Its important to know that there are times even still for me that I struggle with anxious feelings and sometimes its overwhelming. But you know what? I've never died, never made a fool out of myself to the point the people that matter to me cared. All the doom and gloom never happened. So let me break it down for you my friend: Its real simple.
If you hold the hand rail of fear you give it power. If you practice breathing techniques to clam down, you give it power. If you take a pill, consume alcohol to mask, you give it power.  ANYTHING YOU DO to avoid it, you give it power. And you know what? we are so good at that. damn good. we are masters of trying to alleviate problems. 
have you ever been in bed as child and became fearful of a shadow in the room? Its not until you cry out in fear and anxiety and beat yourself up inside scared that your parents come in and show you its nothing but a coat on a coat rack. You become strong one night and you have the same sensation but this time you gain some strength to walk up to the shadow or flip on a light and everything subsides. You learned and that problem magically doesn't come back and if it does you know whats up.  
What I'm getting at is we've been taught and trained to be fearful, its how we survive from being ate from animals. Fight or flight is a very real thing, I get that. You likely have a super hyper imagination that transitions thoughts after thoughts into the next doom and gloom scenario. it keeps you from living and communicating with friends and being out in public.
I said all that to say this:  Instead of running and cowering in fear or what may come, welcome it. Go pet the barking dog on a chain. as you approach you will notice the dog doesnt know what to do and is now the one in fear. sounds bat shit crazy but I promise you if i knew this when i was 21 i would have lived a less fearful life.
Best of luck friend, i hope you can fully understand this and apply it to your life. If you need any more guidance on the subject msg me"
5161,isfp,"Hey - have you thought of going on medication for anxiety? Message me if you want to talk in more detail. I'm not an ISFP (ENFP), but I've dealt with severe anxiety before. I didn't end up going on medication, but I feel like it can be a good option for some people who have very severe cases."
5162,isfp,"I was about that age when i got a job as a dishwasher. Didn't need to talk to anyone, just worked and slept for a year. Sort of like an extended third stage of Morita therapy.  
I met some very cool people there, who appreciated me . . . and put up with me.  
You're not in a vacuum. Other people will help you ^^help ^^yourself.
And it's ok to feel overwhelmed. Just go at your own pace, and do one thing at a time. (e.g. have you sorted out driving lessons?)"
5163,isfp,"You're going to be okay!  
I just recently started medication for anxiety that has helped. But for almost a year before that i was going to therapy regularly, working through the things that were causing so much. I've worked through a lot and have more to go, but I am feeling capable of doing it more easily now."
5164,isfp,"I totally understand what this is like. I've been stuck in such a bad place for the last few months. In my free time, it helps me to paint while listening to interesting/thoughtful podcasts. I try not to spend too much time watching tv as I only feel more anxious after. Spend your time creating and it will feel like you're doing something worthwhile. Especially if you're learning at the same time (from the podcasts)."
5165,isfp,You should try the similar minds mbti functions test. It tests your dominant functions. If you score high on fi youre probably isfp. I would say that if youre getting isfp 50% of the time youre likely isfp.
5166,isfp,"It's Monday morning. My mother's car is broken, so my dad had to drop her off for work and then drive me to school. I don't know how much time I had left until the first bell would ring for homeroom, so I headed straight to the cafeteria for breakfast. 
I walk past a group of girls who think they're hot shit and they proceed to laugh at me and call me out for my fashion sense. ""You can't wear boots with capris!""
I told them, ""I'm so sorry. I won't do it again.""
""Thank you!""
But my mind was saying, ""I'm doing this again in the near future.""
In the words of Rage Against the Machine, ""Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!""
I thought I should tell you guys because I felt offended."
5167,isfp,"Next time, you have to wear something that would completely piss them off, and make sure you do everything in your power to pass them in the halls/at lunch/whatever so they get to see your choice of fashion for the day. "
5168,isfp,"I'd say wear what you're gonna wear, and respond the same way every time. Eventually they'll realize you're only even responding to humor yourself, and don't give a crap what you say. Also, I'm assuming you're in high school, so I can guarantee, if it's really bothering you, that in a few years when you leave that place, NOBODY cares. Nobody. If somebody cares about miniscule details like that in the real world, its because they are paying attention to the wrong things. You do you, and the people you want around are the people who stay. "
5169,isfp,"INFP here with no particular fashion sense either. The ""boots with capris"" combo intrigued me, and I googled it to see what it looked like.
Other than finding some websites saying that it looks bad, I couldn't find anything explaining why... The truth is I probably wouldn't have noticed in the first place, but it doesn't look terrible to me. I don't see why its a big deal."
5170,isfp,"a few days late but i couldn't resist commenting. when i was in highschool i dressed weird as fuck. i didn't care though. i loved all of my fishnets, stripper shoes, and men button down dress shirts (and yes i would wear all of those at the same time). luckily i went to a school for the arts so no one really said anything to me there. but whenever i was in public people would always look at me funny. it didnt bother me though. if any one asks id just say ""i dress how i feel and if you dont like it, it dosnt matter because i dont know you :)"""
5171,isfp,"We're in-the-moment folks. I think more about what colors I could use in my room to make it homier than reddit and stuff! Also I think ISFP's prefer to upvote others and don't like to clutter things with responses that we feel are unnecessary or repetitive? Which makes for tiny and polite, to-the-point comment sections."
5172,isfp,"~~disclosure - not sure what mbti would best suit me~~  
at the base the chick from Only Yesterday.
(with a bit of)
disfunctional escapistness not-giving a shitness of the aunt from Housekeeping
effeteness/aesthetic of the concierge from Grand Budapest
Bits of both Harold and Maude from Harold and Maude
The aspergery blankness and escapism of Morvern Callar (fucking love this movie)
Brokenness/alienation of the protags from The Man Who Sleeps / The Fire Within
Awkwardness/animal lover like Dinky from Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael
a bit of the biting moral oblivion of Johnny from Naked
the anxiety of the hedgehog from The Hedgehog in the Fog
The nihilism of Nicholson's character in Five Easy Pieces
The stupidity of Chance from Being There
awkwardness of the mathematician from My Night at Maud's
But the over-sensitivity/neuroticism of Delphine from The Green Ray 
(that probably isn't much help. a bit of a self-indulgence)
(and i'm sure i'm missing a really good one that'll drive me bonkers)"
5173,isfp,"Sorry if that came off terse. If it's any consolation, my comment was more or less a place holder to remind me to get back to you when more time was allotted. When I saw you sitting at zero yesterday I wanted to reassure you that you were in no way in the wrong for questioning the veracity of the initial statement. Since you also mill around in r/Jung, I'm sure our reactions were probably similar. 
Even though one person was correct in that this arch is a literary staple, it is not exclusive to one type or another. It's a matter of the archetypal path of Jung's Process of Individuation. (Broadstrokes.). Granted, the person who proposed this is at fault for their portion of spreading internet hear-say, kudos to you for knowing better. Recommendations: The Power of Myth and, of course, The Hero's Journey by Campbell. 
As an aside, Orpheus could be placed at ISFP as an example of The Hero's Journey, but to assert that The Hero's Journey hasn't been within the framework of the human collective unconscious for eons and indicative of a singular type is definitely worth the eyeroll it should elicit.
Edit: Probably should tag /u/sonofwar1711 since s/he asked and should not be led astray."

5175,isfp,"Is it:
- Someone who you could admire?
- Someone who is creative?
- Someone physically attractive?
- Someone who is intellectual / knowledgeable?
- Someone who is emotionally aware?
- Someone who is structured and ordered?
- Someone who is good with people?
- Someone who is solution oriented?
Or maybe someone who has some other qualities or interesting quirks?
What do you look for? Or what are some of the qualities your partner has that you adore?
Hope you can state your sex as well, because different sexes could potentially prioritize different qualities"
5176,isfp,"Out of the things you listed, I prefer a man who I can admire, is emotionally aware, structured and ordered and good with people. I'm a 20 y/o woman.
‚Äã
I think the best trait is emotional inteligence. If I go too detailed, I will never find my man so... Well heck I love big and tall men too."
5177,isfp,"I am an 18 y/o woman and i look for partners who are emotionally mature, good communicators, and supportive/nonjudgmental. I also prefer fiscally responsible men who understand the value of money and men who are decisive without being domineering. "
5178,isfp,"19 Male
Honestly, another ISFP...
Someone who I can deeply relate to, and understands me. Someone who's quiet and introverted, while simultaneously being very grounded and observant in the outside world. Someone who creates art of any form, as long as it's their creation. Someone who to take spontaneous adventures with, and doesn't mind moving around.
Okay never mind, I can't just find a clone on myself. Though it's kind of weird, considering how much I dislike myself."
5179,isfp,"27M, ISFP  
1) Definitely someone I can admire
2) I love creative people
3) I don't give much thought to physical attractiveness. Again, this is a debatable  and everyone has different views.
4) Definitively someone who is knowledgeable. If I find interest in that particular subject, it's a Win-Win
5) ISFP's are emotionally aware people. It would be horrible if our partners were unemotional. Generally speaking, if I am communicating with someone who doesn't show emotions, I stop communicating. Not worth my time. 
6) I'm extremely laid back and messy. But I wouldn't mind someone with a certain degree of structure and order
7) Definitely. Someone who is a douchebag to others would eventually be a douchebag towards you at some point.
8) Being able to find solutions is a great ability. Sometimes I get pissed at people suggesting solutions because I just wanted to vent (to make myself feel better).
:)"
5180,isfp,Honestly most of the men I've been most attracted to have been INTx. I feel like they balance me out. It would be nice to be with someone who was more in touch with their emotions but those guys also tend to bore me unfortunately.
5181,isfp,"24M - someone in good shape who cares about their appearance and fashion. women who work out(resistance training) and have a good shape are most attractive. creativity is great as well, I love when someone likes to draw/paint/make music and is passionate about it, and can appreciate art + aesthetics of things. I am really into pale, blonde women, but like other skin/hair colors as well- this is just my favorite skin/hair combination.
overall a relaxed personality is great, but I like them to be into me enough that I don't have to go out of my way too much to initiate things. 
also someone I can talk to about everything with, like a very good friend. very important too that she's kind and playful"
5182,isfp,"(19/m)
Don't really want a relationship, but if I had to think of the perfect girlfriend:


Physically attractive.


Tough exterior, soft interior. Type of person that doesn't take other people's bullshit and calls them out on their crap, but isn't a troubleseeker. Tries to maintain peace and be pleasant unless provoked. Only shows their soft, caring side to people close to them, and really cares for those. Still has a bit of a playful, spunky side to them in general. 


Has similar interests. 


Open minded and flexible, helps me out of my tunnelvision and challenges me in some ways, but sometimes just more down to earth as well.


Deeply cares for the things and people she loves.


Honest and authentic. Clever and aware of things.


(I wonder which type she'd be)"
5183,isfp,"20 year old male. I'd be happiest with an extroverted, modest, loyal girl. My friends and family are overwhelmingly extroverted, I like having them pull me out of my shell and I enjoy helping them figure themselves out. Modesty and loyalty are also great qualities to have.
It's great to see a girl who genuinely works towards a cause/profession she believes in. Not for attention or validation, but true dedication for its own sake."
5184,isfp,"It feels like everything I do is just a distraction from the painful truth that life is pain. How the hell are monks able to meditate for literally hours on end? I stopped my addictions which were video games and anime, but without them I feel so alone.
This feeling of being alone is torture. It's so boring. Time is just passing me by while I achieve nothing. What is there to achieve? If I work hard and make decent money, I still won't be able to have a beautiful wife/girlfriend. I'm unattractive. 
I have been coping throughout my whole life. I looked up to Bruce Lee and Rey Mysterio because they were short like me. It made me feel better about myself. 
I pretend that I don't need women, but it's just a form of coping. ""I save a lot of money from not going on dates anyway"", ""I can use my energy for better things"", ""I won't have to pay for child support when the divorce happens"", ""I won't have to worry about being cheated on"", etc.
I just want to live like I did when I was a child. Have fun and lose track of time. Days passing by so fast, but at the same time slowly. Days are passing by fast for me now, but I wish I could enjoy them more. I feel like I'm just rotting away slowly. 
I don't know where I'm going with this. If you can relate, then I'm sorry that you have to go through these kinds of things. It's rough. Life is like a game, but you don't get to choose the difficulty like in Kingdom Hearts. 
I won't give up though. I know what it is like to be at the very bottom of the hole. So depressed that you think of a plan to end it all. There was a post here that said ""figure it out."" I relate to that quote very much so. My goal in life is to figure it out. There is always a way out!!"
5185,isfp,"My big tip. Get yourself 3 hobbies:
1. To keep you fit
2. To make you money
3. For creative purposes
Yes you can have a hobby which has all 3 aspects e.g. Gardening.
However at first it may be hard and you may not like the hobbies so keep changing it up till you find ones you like.
You may not like some at first because your not instantly good at them but remember nothing comes instantly.
People (I'm one of them) easily give up nowadays and don't have proper hobbies since it's very easy to get easy dopamine from YouTube, anime, videa games etc however if you have proper hobbies with proper goals and see yourself progress it will keep you busy and happy. Hope this helps. "
5186,isfp,"That figure it out post was mine. Its how I live. No matter how down I get I always think those three words. The closest to hitting rock bottom I ever came was when I considered breaking my leg to get out of a deployment. Went so far as to ask a friend to do it for me. I really only asked because I knew I needed someone to talk some sense into me. Thankfully he talked me out of it. Granted. I chose someone I knew damn well wasn't gonna hurt me.
Reaching out for help is fine. Don't ever let yourself think that needing help makes you weak. We all need help. I'm sure Rey Mysterio and Bruce Lee needed help at some point too. I know when we find ourselves in holes it always seems easier to find a shovel than a ladder, but there is always a ladder. Sometimes you gotta dig it up though unfortunately. Find that ladder. Figure it out.
Also. Brother to brother. You probably aren't as ugly as you think you are. No homo. The human mind is significantly more critical of itself when looking in a mirror. Someone told me that a while back and it made me feel a bit better about myself."
5187,isfp,"Don't suppress your feelings. I know it can be painful so it's helpful sometimes to rationalize away, but from personal experience I know that connecting with your reality - the painful and the ugly - can tell you where you need to go next. Have you sought any outside help from therapy/friends/family etc. ?"
5188,isfp,"I can completely understand where you are coming from. 
Last year I went through one of the most awful head spaces I have ever been in. My 2 best friends got together and shut me out, before hand we were spending every day together and then over night I was lucky to get a text response, that and with not feeling like I was progressing at work I literally felt like I deserved it, that I wasn‚Äôt liked and that I had no hope for a future. At one point I rewrote the lyrics of songs that I knew and was listening to at the time and these all references feeling alone and ending my life, I even went as far to try and quit my job on the spot so that I could go and kill my self, luckily my work wouldn‚Äôt let me and got me in contact with a councillor, I started taking depression tablets and I started seeing a therapist once a week. It took time, I remember one morning on my way to work after I moved homes as my previous one wasn‚Äôt habitable thinking, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to think like this, people still need me and I actually don‚Äôt want to die, there trying to help me dig myself out of a whole‚Äô and automatically from that day, I haven‚Äôt looked back. 
Fast forward 6 months I don‚Äôt even have to tell myself this anymore as people always come to me! I‚Äôm no longer taking medication and I‚Äôm not seeing the therapist. I‚Äôve made new friends and those friends I spoke about earlier have come back into my life, but I‚Äôm cautious around them now and won‚Äôt let them get too close again. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs easy, but one thing we have is understanding of others and the equality that goes with it, something that I now apply to myself. One thing I think a lot of people forget. 
I‚Äôm sure you will get there! And I‚Äôm hoping that this may help even a tiny bit. "
5189,isfp,"I feel like life is often a never-ending stream of suffering and struggle. But the good things here and there mean too much to me to give up. Instead I try to look at the struggle as a way for me to get stronger.
I agree with the guy who said to get three hobbies. I've recently (last six months or so) made a serious effort to get back into productive hobbies I used to enjoy and also get in shape. It has really helped.
As far as being lonely goes and thinking you're too unattractive to get a girlfriend, don't let your looks hold you back too much. Take care of yourself and try to dress well and you'd be surprised. I know I don't generally care too much about what people look like. If I like someone's personality and we have fun talking or gaming together or whatever it is we do, I will start to see things about them that I like, I.E. their eyes or their hands or their hair color. Not even that I have preferences for any of those things either it's just what I do. And I have talked to others who feel the same. 
Meanwhile everyone tells me I look great and I get random men hitting on me even IRL but no one I feel connected to is interested in a relationship it seems. But I've only been single the last year and a half so I figure there's lots of time for me to meet someone to be with who actually wants to be with me.
And I bet there's lots of time for you, too! :)"
5190,isfp,"This is true. I'm a female who used to hate myself and the way I looked no matter how much outside affirmation I got. It was really because of the deep depression I had and when I dealt with that, I could see what everyone else saw in me. :) 
‚Äã"
5191,isfp,"Same here, I used to do nothing, just watch anime, youtube, play video games all the time then I realised I'm not doing anything with my life. This year I started my hobbies and I've felt so much better and happier. "
5192,isfp,"It has happened at some point, though I wasn't really making things up. I was mainly talking about minor details, such as the colour of the sky, or something like that. It was usually when I wanted to communicate with the person, yet they would dismiss any topic I'd try to bring up."
5193,isfp,"I haven't been able to find a lot on this pairing, but my SO is a male ISFP and I am a female INFJ. Have any of you ISFPs had relationships with INFJs? What was that like for you? What positives/benefits or negatives/issues did you experience with them? Curious to hear what you have to say. :)"
5194,isfp,"I lived with a  male INFJ once.  Room mate situation. He was the hottest guy I've ever known but something about him rubbed me the wrong way.  I don't perceive all INFJs like him,  but he had this whole whiny little critical bitch thing going on.  He imagined some nonexistent relationship or something had gone down between us and then RAGED on me one day when I politely asked him to moved out sometime in the not too distant future.  Like red faced, screaming, cried.
So awkward. 
I stayed away from INFJs after that.  "
5195,isfp,"My wife is INFJ. I'm ISFP. We've been together for seven years and have a lot of chemistry and shared life experience. As far as personality goes... 


we connect a lot on art, food, and travel


she (INFJ) is organized and helps me (ISFP) with long range goals 


I (ISFP) help her (INFJ) with technical needs in the present (technology, paying bills, tidying up the kitchen)


she (INFJ) helps me to read people, where I tend to be too trusting or soft


I (ISFP) help her (INFJ) to be compassionate toward others and herself


I (INFJ) get really uncomfortable when she (INFJ) seems to be judgmental and cold toward people. She can go on and on about what she dislikes and I just can't. 


I (ISFP) sometimes annoy her (INFJ) with my spontaneity (read: lack of plan) when we're out on a date 


she (INFJ) makes a huge mess when she's cleaning the house and I (ISFP) get worried about the chaos because I can't see her ultimate plan. 

"
5196,isfp,"if i were you i'd post this in /r/INFJ too since this sub is WAY quieter--you're unlikely to get a lot of responses. i'd be curious to see the INFJ responses myself
i know this particular INFJ youtuber https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM6Im-HLEahrhmABLkOBJJg/videos
is married to an ISFP dude. might be worth it to watch her videos on ISFPs? also, googling ISFP-INFJ might yield some threads on PerC or something"
5197,isfp,"Well I know INFJs tend to engage in constant self-reflection, and if left unchecked in can become self-criticism, which if it goes too far can become self-loathing (I've been there, but I have anxiety - so not sure if that's what his deal was.) But yeah sounds like he had some other problems going on there."
5198,isfp,"How do you complement each other? For me and my SO I'd have to say we balance each other out with my need to plan everything and his tendency to take it easy. He reminds me to live in the moment more than I think I could if he weren't a presence in my life, and I think he's been better about making commitments and sticking to them because of my influence."
5199,isfp,"Exactly. I tend to be more structured while he's more laid back, however he has a tendency to go through ""excitable phases"" while I just sit back, watch, and laugh. He's better with budgets, but I'm the one who usually thinks about the savings. He's also more able to immediately see all sides without getting caught up, and I'm more emotional and it takes more time for me to process."
5200,isfp,Yeah what the hell. All we did was bicker and disagree and when I pointed it out all he a said was 'I feel like we challenge each other.' I was like uuuuuuuhhh??? Then he was upset when I actually got into an actual real relationship :/
5201,isfp,"This might be kind of a long shot because this sub is fairly small. But I‚Äôm about to graduate high school (I‚Äôm a female by the way). My dad and brother are both active duty. I‚Äôm supposed to move back to the states in August to start university, but I‚Äôm really anxious because I hated living in the area that I‚Äôm moving back to, and also, since my parents won‚Äôt be financially supporting me, I‚Äôm worried about working full time, going to school full time, and still not being able to cover expenses.
So I‚Äôm seriously considering enlisting in the Air Force, for the minimum enlistment. I‚Äôm most comfortable in military communities because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve grown up with, and I think it would be good for me to kind of be forced to take care of myself and be more responsible when I‚Äôm first really figuring out how to be an adult. 
My concern is that I‚Äôm verrrry independent. I‚Äôm not necessarily rebellious, but I also don‚Äôt really handle others telling me what to do well. I‚Äôm not super observant and break rules a lot, simply because I‚Äôm oblivious (not on purpose!). I need a lot of space, and I have mixed feelings about how well I would handle BMT. Idk, I‚Äôm sure it would be good to kind of force myself to get out of my comfort zone. Just curious if any of you have served, how did you respond in that kind of environment, any advice, etc etc. Thank you!"
5202,isfp,"I did  four years in the Marines. I joined the buddy program right out of high school and me and my buddy got put in the infantry. Honestly. It was fucking miserable. Boot camp every waking moment was micromanaged and frankly it was hell. The remainder of my contract was fine though. I got pretty lucky as far as infantry contracts go. I got selected to go to the ceremonial marching grounds instead of some desert overseas. I fired the 21 gun salute in Arlington for two years.  Attended 500+ funerals in that two years. That was the coolest thing I have ever done. I was good at marching so I got treated pretty well. Most of the funerals were just retired members dying of old age. Only did like ten or so active duty funerals. After that I got stuck in a normal infantry battalion and did some training in Japan and South Korea. So in short I never entered an active war zone having joined during a time of war.
I can say I didn't fit in at all. I went from the nerd in high school getting straight A's. Had the highest ASVAB score in my school when I took it. Graduated top 5 of my class. To being thrown into a room with a bunch of bloodthirsty mouth breathers. I was leagues smarter than the average person there. Academically at least. Granted that worked out for me in the end. I had three certificate of completions from afjrotc in high school. Which allowed me to start out E-2. If you got them in the Air Force you would be an E-3 by the way.  I also did everything that you can do to improve your cutting score (the number that determines whether or not you pick up ranks). So I picked up Corporal before I got out which like 95% of infantry Marines don't. Being a Corporal for the last eight months was a fucking game changer. The military respects rank. If you do join. Keep your nose clean, and do things that increase your odds of picking up rank. It pays off in the end. 
I think often if I would do it again knowing what I know now, and the answer is always yes. Honorable discharge looks great on a resume. Honestly the military gives you an appreciation for the small things in life that I don't know you can get anyway else. It was just a cool thing I did, and I have a lot of stories. The last an biggest reason though. I met two of the best friends I will ever have while I served. There is something about going through shit with people that makes you get close to each other. For that reason alone I would suffer through it again. Having access to the VA is a nice safety curtain. The military paying most of the expenses related to going to college is very helpful.
Its worth it. Does it suck. Oh yeah. Worse than you think it does. It is totally worth it though. Just don't be a fucking idiot like me and sign an open contract. Pick out a job you think you would like. Also I want you to understand this. Your recruiter is a fucking liar. I repeat. They are fucking liars. All you are is a number to them. They are gonna seem so nice. They are gonna tell you the sweetest fucking things, but its all a lie. Unless you get it in paper. It doesn't exist."
5203,isfp,"Hi :) currently AD in the Marine Corps for almost 9 years. For me I chose the MC as a way to stabilize me, because I‚Äôm not good at being consistent or stable on my own. I‚Äôd rather live whimsically. While it has worked exactly as expected, there has been some downsides. I wouldn‚Äôt like being ‚Äúcontrolled,‚Äù but I have never really felt that way. Just some regret due to time invested that hasn‚Äôt been necessarily satisfying when thinking about my long term goals. 
I‚Äôd say that 4 years will fly by, and the Air Force is super relaxed compared to any other branch so you‚Äôd be fine. Just make sure you pick a job that is marketable on the outside, and then you have 4 years of work experience and veteran status when you transition. 
Really though, anytime I have Marines complain about their first term (4 years) I just remind them how small an amount of time that is in the grand scheme of life. "
5204,isfp,"Hi! Thank you for responding, and sorry I‚Äôm so late to reply lol. My dad has been enlisted since I was about 6 or 7, and my brother enlisted about a year and a half ago, so a lot of what you‚Äôre saying sounds awfully familiar, especially about the recruiters and the open contracts üòÇ.
I do think I‚Äôm leaning a little more towards joining, mostly because I really want to be independent (stuff isn‚Äôt always great at home) and I don‚Äôt want to commit myself to working full-time and studying at university for three years, and potentially not making enough to support myself. Also, I am interested in a lot of their jobs, although I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre talking about phasing out a lot of the medical jobs to contractors. I‚Äôve mostly been thinking about operations intel or aerospace medical.
But how did you decide on the marines? (I actually watched a video a few days ago that was sponsored by the marines, where 4 civilians were allowed to participate in BMT for 3 days, and WOW I don‚Äôt think I personally could handle it, but kudos to you! I definitely have a newfound respect for Marines). Also, how did you train for basic ahead of time? If you could do it all again, do you still think you‚Äôd join the marines, or would you try a different branch? Oh, and also, why did you choose to discharge?"
5205,isfp,"I only joined the Marines because my buddy did. I knew I wanted to do the buddy program with him, and he had his heart set on the Marines. I never really even considered which branch to join. I always knew I wanted to join. I didn't know why either. Patriotism? Who knows. I make impulsive decisions, and never think about them ahead of time. Not much has changed in that regards since high school.
As far as getting ready ahead of time for boot camp. I got into a program at my recruiting office during junior year. I went out to my recruiting office once a week. It was basically a group of assholes running around screaming. Honestly it was pretty fun. Gave me my first taste of what I was gonna be dealing with, but oh baby. It wasn't even close. Had me brainwashed into thinking it would be easy. Did mock physical fitness tests once a month. I was pretty big in high school. Like 6 foot tall, and 215 pounds. Not muscle. All flab. I lost fucking thirty pounds in boot camp. Still wasn't even the slowest guy though. I thank god for recruit Lamb. His fat ass saved me from a lot of degradation. Him and Jakaran's dumbass. Those are some of the first thoughts I have ever had that I consider evil. I am very glad they were there to suffer instead of me. Boot camp was all about not being the slowest recruit, and they filled those shoes instead of me. Jakaran was a fucking Gomer Pyle wannabe. Dude was dead on the inside.
I would join the Marines every time, and yes I would do it again. The Marines have the best jokes. Proud to be a crayon eater. Being around a bunch of numbskulls gave me an appreciation for my own intelligence that I don't know the other branches could have given me. Also I would do the infantry again as well for that same reason. The infantry really gave me an appreciation for the small things in life. Being completely stripped of my freedom and all the nice things in life for months at a time really makes you think about whats important.
As far as why I discharged. I knew the second I stepped off the bus, and stood on the yellow footprints that I fucked up. I didn't fit in for shit. I fucking loathe being micromanaged. The biggest reason though was just how much I hated my second unit. I was treated so fucking unfairly. My first two years was at the cemetery at Arlington. So when I got put into a real infantry battalion it was miserable. I had had two years to forget everything I learned during my training about being a rifleman. I also hadn't deployed. Which was the only thing that matters to grunts. So the boots didn't like/respect me because I wasn't one of them, and the post deployment Marines saw me as another boot despite having been in longer than them. I had no in to try and become friends with either of the two sides. I was very unhappy for two years. Had no fucking friends in that unit. Got treated like trash. It was so fucking unfair. I didn't fucking choose to go to Arlington. I just happened to be exactly six feet tall with a near perfect pft score, so they selected me for it. I wish they had kept me for another term there. Had they done that I would have re-enlisted. I liked Arlington. I took pride in what I did there. It mattered. The fuck fuck training I did in Lejeune and Okinawa didn't matter to me. I think the guys there could see that too. Which didn't help me make friends. I just wanted out. I wanted my freedom back. I wanted to be with my old friends again."
5206,isfp,"I actually enjoy being round people, it really all just depends on the situation.
First week of school is always exhausting because you're sort of forced to be as social as possible to make connections with people, and being in large crowds and meeting lots of new people can be kind of stressful for me.
I am usually the person to observe the conversation, speak when spoken to, or input my voice when I feel that it is appropriate. 
If I'm with people I've established a solid connection with, I am able to really let loose and sometimes to stupid, embarrassing things haha.
I'm admittedly very quick to judge the type of people in a group I enter, and if I feel that I do not mesh well with the individuals in a group, I will leave without a trace of my being, haha. "
5207,isfp,"I don't know how to answer this question...it's very vague. I react to most social situations differently. It can be affected by many factors, such as my mood, if I'm comfortable with the people I'm around, how many people I'm around, the activity in question, how long the social situation is, etc. Can you be more specific? If you provide a scenario, I can tell you how I'll react."
5208,isfp,"No worries! If I'm around a large group of people I don't know terribly well, yes I definitely get shy. Uncomfortable...not as much, but that depends on the situation/my mood.
When I'm around people, my brain tends to turn to static and I often can't think of things to talk about, so I just play the wallflower and observe my surroundings and listen to other's conversations. I usually only speak when spoken to, unless I actually think of something to contribute to the conversation.
I do have mild social anxiety, so some of that could be related there rather than being type-related, but I'm sure SOME of it is type-related."
5209,isfp,I know it's a stereotype that were artistic so don't assume I'm saying you all are but I know some of you are. I just opened my shop on etsy and I virtually know nothing about it. Do any of you have any tips to get sales or is there another outlet you use to sell your art? If you want to check out my page here's my link : https://www.etsy.com/shop/PassionAbovePower?ref=search_shop_redirect
5210,isfp,"oh cool! i would suggest tagging your items with buzzwords, and also having multiple listings going at once :) i love the detail on the bird, btw. good luck out there!
also... i do some knitting and sell a couple knitted items on my etsy, along with some vtg clothes... https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/spectralspectrum"
5211,isfp,"No, I'm happy to display... I have an insta and I'm submitting for a show in a day or two, I'm just not sure I want to sell online yet... More like a dm me and we'll chat thing, but I haven't even made that statement yet üòå"
5212,isfp,"Ready to leave my sales job. I‚Äôve held a majority sales positions for most my life. I think the performance or artistic side has allowed me to be successful. But the authenticity, and introversion side of me absolutely hates it. I also really crave more stability than sales provided. 
Curious if any ISFPs here are in a skilled trade of some sort? If so, what do you do?"
5213,isfp,"My first sales job was as a banker with Wells Fargo. I lasted 6 months before I quit. That was awful, the pressue the micro management for sales was awful. 
I always had my mother and immediately family behind me telling me I‚Äôd be an awesome salesperson since I can connect with people and can be so animated. 
My second go around was as a real estate agent. I‚Äôve last longer at this because I‚Äôm self employed so there isn‚Äôt the micro management. There are times it‚Äôs less ‚Äúsalesey‚Äù but at the core of it, is trying to sell yourself and getting people to commit to work with me. I can‚Äôt stand that aspect. Plus the lack of stability in income has done nothing but drive me bat shot crazy. With a wife and three kids, I can‚Äôt take it and I want to do something this time that is more in line with myself. "
5214,isfp,"Well good luck.  Your talk of enjoying less micromanagement does make sense with this type, though other responsibilities of that job do clash.  I wish I had better suggestions.  Most of the jobs on ISFP lists don't appeal to me or don't earn enough, which sucks!
For me I had a scant few alternates.

Detective
Cinematographer (skilled trade)
Biologist
English teacher
Chef (skilled trade)

If I had to:

Electrician (skilled trade)
Carpenter (skilled trade)
Accountant
Welder (skilled trade)

So you can kind of see the dichotomy: in short, the bottom list is more ISTP-ish."
5215,isfp,"Right, earning potential is stifling to most alternatives. I am actually thinking of perhaps an electrical lineman. I do need something that is mentally engaging for me, and I just don‚Äôt have enough talent to make money doing anything creative. Electrician could be a close second for me, but I think I could tire of troubleshooting the same mundane residential repairs. Unless you go highly specialized, or open your own company, Electricians make, ‚Äúokay‚Äù money.
Lineman can make great money, the program I am looking into has you traveling around the Southeast, which I would love the opportunity to travel for a while, it‚Äôs outdoor work, it is physically engaging, but definitely still has a mental component, which is important to me. Best of all, no customer interaction!!! No sales! The union has killer benefits and pension too. Once I graduate the apprenticeship program, I can take assignments as where I wish. Plus there‚Äôs some excitement, climbing polls and towers. "
5216,isfp,"I do, just applied to uni and chose comp sci at all of them due to it not being a hobby of mine. Id love to study meteorology but not do it for a living because I feel like that would kill my interest in it."
5217,isfp,"Definitely. I'm a music major and there are lots of days where I think about quitting because I don't even get time to do any of my own stuff anymore. Then I go to a recital or turn a corner in my lesson and I remember why I do it. 
I have full confidence that once I graduate and I can actually have some time to focus on the parts of music that I love, I'll be glad I had the experience of being forced to do it for a bit. "
5218,isfp,"Sure, I started out as Mechanical Engineering but math wasn't my strongest suite and I didn't like the computer design stuff and was more interested in being hands on. I was on the racing team at school and liked the hands on stuff and thought about becoming a technician but then my back went out and I have a bad back now and dont think I could do it physically. :( My therapist suggested I look into Public Health and I took an intro class and liked it a lot and that's what I'm majoring in now. I'm thinking about minoring in social work as well so that I could get a masters in it social work later if I want to and then being a therapist with that. "
5219,isfp,"I have a theory that I am a jaded ISFP although a lot of people have mistyped me as an ISTP / xNTJ because I come off as cold to almost everyone (common for ISTPs IME) and xxTJ because I have a very simplistic (though rigid and crucial) moral code and have developed good Te after many years spent in stress relying upon the grip function.
First of all Fi is definitely my dominant function. Based on my personal experience I have a set of values (although it is very simplistic, meaning most situations are amoral) and Se is quite likely my secondary function (making music / art is my main hobby). Ni for third (I can usually predict how things will go and I am good at finding the underlying truth) and Te for fourth (my Te 
Most of the ISFP descriptions focus on how ISFPs are concerned about preserving harmony, keeping others happy, charity, fulfilling their personal values in their environment, etc (basically an E9). However my personal moral set is very individualistic, more like libertarianism. Although I am a fairly nice person in general I don't go out of my way to preserve harmony / make others happy / etc. and because my personal experiences are more negative my Fi has made me very jaded: I am very cynical about other people and there is no one I fully trust. This is because my personal experiences have told my Fi that no one can be trusted (like an unhealthy E8). This is in contrast with most ISFP descriptions which are very idealistic, about over-trusting friends / significant others / etc.
Furthermore, I take more pleasure in seeing the (very) few people I dislike / hate suffering hardship than I do in seeing someone I consider ethical succeed. I also have a vague sense of dysphoria all the time, I never feel really happy, though sometimes I feel stimulated and confuse that for joy. I also was rather depressed for the majority of my life up to present in retrospect which led me to completely pack away my emotions, to the point that people call me robotic and emotionless. They still do now, even as emotions about normal things like working on a homework assignment overwhelm me, it's just that my emotions are hidden now.
I feel like an unhealthy 8 in a sea of Nines, lol.
BTW I think my tritype is 348 sp/sx. Very heavy on the sp, light on the sx.
EDIT: also I don't relate to many of the ISFP weaknesses such as low self esteem, unable to complete tasks when in stress, etc. in fact I am pretty successful despite having substantial setbacks. When I get stressed out I just become very sadistic and narcissistic to those I dislike."
5220,isfp,"An over stressed ENTJ? Whose Fi is pretty strong? 
When I used to be depressed, my Fe came out a lot. I used to correct other people and fight for what's right. That was also the time I found out about mbti and I typed myself as an ISFP. But then when depression faded away, I became more of my own self and o got to know more and more about myself. Then I discovered the mbti functions and typed myself as an ISTP. I'm no expert."
5221,isfp,"Since high school and up until recently, I've always identified as an INFP. I would take online evaluations specifically for MBTI in the past. However, just this morning, I took a personality quiz here without knowing it would provide a MBTI evalation, and it seems now I'm an ISFP. Factors I have in mind are the time of day I usually take those evaluations. I would often take them later in the day, usually at night. I also would take a personality quiz for the intent of discovering my type indicator. I've also read that in most cases, in high school, we tend to take these evaluations with our ideal selves in mind, so that might have stuck with me. I don't know. This is sort of ground-breaking for me, and all this time I've always thought I was an INFP. Are there any big differences between the two?"
5222,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and that test pegged me halfway through. 
Anecdotally, a dear INFP friend and I were discussing the differences between us and found the biggest difference was in where we like to be ""present."" I need to be in the current moment as thinking too hard about the future makes me anxious and thinking too much of the past depresses me. I enjoy experiencing life as if I were sitting on the shore as the waves wash over me. 
She prefers to think in the future and in possibility. In my beach analogy, she wouldn't even be there! She'd be somewhere else doing something else but dreaming of someday enjoying the experience. The act of imagining it is where she draws her pleasure."
5223,isfp,"Types don't really change. Look at functions and descriptions more than relying on these tests. They're good for giving you an idea, but that's about it.
This test correctly typed me as ISFP, but it kept jumping back and forth between ISFP and ISFJ. I always find the P/J questions very ambiguous as it depends so heavily on the situation.
I often test as INFP, and there are a lot of similarities. As another person said, we are all about living in the moment. It's difficult to see far into the future because we're so focused on the present. I do think about the past a lot...but probably nit as much as I think I do.
http://youtu.be/OUiLIrK7RmQ
This video (and I would assume the INFP one as well) describes a lot of the differences between ISFPs and INFPs and how they use the functions differently. I found everything in that video to be SPOT ON. If you think that describes you, then maybe you are an ISFP. But don't assume that you were previously mistyped or your type changed simply because one test said otherwise!"
5224,isfp,"I think this test doesn't work properly. At first it was saying that I was INFP, then INTP, then for quite awhile, ISTP, which is one of the types I'm least like. Eventually it settled on INTP, though I'm actually an INFP.
Moreover, if you watch the OCEAN sliders changing as you answer the questions, sometimes it responds in strange ways, particularly on the Openness scale, which correlates to S/N in Myers Briggs.
Biggest difference between the two types is that INFPs engage with the outer world intuitively--we're always looking for tangential connections between, bouncing from one idea to another and imagining what could be at the expense of what is. 
On the other hand, ISFPs engage with the outer word through their senses--they're very tuned into their physical surroundings and the behaviour of others and are more hands-on and direct, focusing on the here and now."
5225,isfp,"I got that too. I always find those questions super ambiguous. Depending on the situation, my answers will change. Are we talking about at work? At school? By myself? In a group of friends? So that one always ends up being on the border for how I answer the questions...but when I read descriptions discerning between the two? I am a PRIME example of a perceiver...that happens to like writing lists. (But usually it's to waste time.)"
5226,isfp,"My boyfriend is an ISFP, and he believes that you can't categorize people into 16 personalities. I want to explain to him that MBTI is more about a person's core rather than describing each person's whole being. I think it would help us understand each other much better if he was knowledgeable about it.
So my question is how exactly do I explain/talk to him about it without him shutting off the idea? (I'm an INFJ if that helps at all.)"
5227,isfp,"What about making him read about cognitive functions? I find that more complete than the 'brush the surface' isfp descriptions.  And be ready to be disappointed even then, if they're not open to it now they may be even more resistant if they're forced to sit through it. "
5228,isfp,"Honestly if he's not interested himself, it'll probably be hard to get him interested. I don't know if it's something you can force. Either he finds it interesting or he doesn't.
Have you tried explaining it like you did here? That it's not about zeroing in on every aspect of a person's personality? That it's about finding the different ways people interact with the world and process information?"
5229,isfp,"I have an ISFP SO and I've found that the best way to get an ISFP into MBTI is to apply it directly to real life. Explain things like ""X is an ESTJ so their dominant function is extroverted sensing, which means they tend to like more active/physical things"". MBTI as a theory alone doesn't interest an ISFP--it has to be relevant to the surrounding world.
Also, my favorite analogy for MBTI is that it's like handedness--it measures your preferences. A right-handed person can use both hands, but prefers the right hand. Similarly, an ISFP can use all functions, but prefers Fi and Se. Thus, it's actually possible to categorize everyone into one of those 16 types."
5230,isfp,"Prove what's stupid and bullshit about it first maybe
Maybe the issues and how so much of the speculation around it doesn't apply at all to real life- just to ease their suspicion about the whole thing being overly mechanical and sort of indecent to individuals with varying personalities.
Then point to real life examples, use real people you know- explaining similarities and differences
I don't know how well analogies would work. I don't think they would with SFPs.
At the same time I feel a bit unwieldy about pointing fingers and going ""this person is this type and they did this because of that""- especially at the risk of being inaccurate and essentially giving someone else a loaded gun to sort of raise their own ego or hurt others with. (Like the whole S and N prejudice, or the F and T misconceptions)
Even leading down the road to getting people to mistype themselves
I'd actually like to know how ISFPs prefer getting into it. Would the whole ""cautious"" approach be bad for an ISFP?
I think I've spoken with ISFPs before but they seem to disagree and ""stick with it"" rather than entertain the idea that theory might be right in some aspects. Not even particularly with mbti."
5231,isfp,"I have, but I don't think he understood what I meant by core personality vs whole being. Although, telling him it's about finding the different ways people interact with the world and process information specifically is a good idea. I think he'd be able to grasp the concept  a lot better when if I put it like that.
Thank you for your input!"
5232,isfp,"Hopefully you find some way to explain it to pique his interest!
Maybe tell him it's less about defining/grouping personality traits as it is explaining what motivates people and how to understand what motivates other people?"
5233,isfp,"Seeing as how dead and forsaken this sub is and how I'm genuinely perplexed by this ISFP and need help, why not.
Long story short, a little more than a month ago I met this ISFP girl. I'm 99% certain she is ISFP, she fits all the stereotypes and all the things associated with ISFP behavior that I have scoured the entire internet including the farthest reaches for in true INTP fashion. She fits it to a T. Theoretically, INTP/ISFP is never supposed to work right from the start and is one of the harder pairs to bring together, but I believe that is bullshit and with the right respect, communication, and sacrifice from any two people, any mbti combination can make it work.
Since then, we've hung out every single weekend(already have plans for next weekend), and my feelings for her have blossomed. She's genuine, a great listener, puts me at ease, and her sense of the moment is amazing to me, probably because I live in my own head too much. I don't even care that she'd rather not listen to my intellectual banter and keep it to myself instead, I just focus on her strengths and appreciate what she brings to the table.
The problem is that I can't read her locked, heavily guarded closed book. It bothers me because she doesn't show any signs of interest, like at all. She is extremely, extremely good at it, and I can't tell whether it's her ISFP superpower of properly managing the outward radiance of her emotions or she just isn't interested in me. The numerous times we've hung out, I feel like nothing but a simple friend to her. On the other hand, I think I have given enough signals to show that I'm interested, such as going to great lengths to help her plan her extended trip overseas, even gifting her stuff she needed to take with her. She's quite slow paced and feeble-minded(for lack of a better word), and I am more than willing to use my Ti and logic to help her with anything. I do little things here and there(cause I know ISFPs appreciate action more than words) to convey how I feel. Matter of fact, I feel like I've done so much(my ability to solve problems with ease has been a welcome addition to her disorderly and reckless way of diving into things without thinking it seems) I need to scale back the charity before I scare her off.
But even then, she hasn't done anything to reciprocate. It bothers me and drives me crazy. Normally I'm really good at noticing subtle cues that girls give off that scream interest, as I've had a fair share of girls in the past(unfortunately mostly ESFJ, ESFP). But when it comes to her, she shows absolutely nothing.
If it means anything, I asked her to be my date to a wedding I'm attending next month, and she said yes. I sorta used it as a cry for help, because we are both vegan and I didn't want to sit with hundreds of carnivores alone at this wedding convention and wanted some company, but she nodded almost immediately. Now I'm not sure if she's just being a really supportive friend or sees it as an excellent opportunity to further our relationship. If she truly isn't interested in me, I don't think she would have agreed to such a thing because of the wrong implications that come with deciding to partake in such a thing with me...
Is all of this simply because she is still in the process of warming up to me? I understand that ISFPs seek long term partners and not flings. Will she eventually reciprocate further down the road? I want to bring up questions to set things straight between the two of us because I don't want to drag things on just to be hurt in the end. But I don't want to blow it too early. Is one month too short of a time period to judge, and should I give her more time to process how she feels inside(Fi)? I'm so perplexed on what to do, any advice offered is greatly appreciated."
5234,isfp,"Oh boy. Ok first off, feebleminded? hahaha oh where would she be without you? In my experience, opposites attract but don't do well over the long haul. You think it's a fit, that she completes you. You are ready to make a sacrifice. So first logical question is why wouldn't you find a relationship that wasn't going to be a lot of work and sacrifice? The fact that she has qualities that ""match"" you and you help her and she's not reciprocating tells me that you are looking to put 2 halves together to make a whole. You don't need to figure her out, you need to figure yourself out. Stop seeing yourself and her as limited in any way. Then come together as two wholes."
5235,isfp,"Those isfp stereotypes mostly aren't accurate.
But if she is an isfp, I have this to say:
You seem not to know much about her. Like you put her on a pedestal (and we all do that) but you also seem to have a whole storyline in your head that is very much like a fairytale (the prince saves the princess, but the princess's personality isn't really revealed), because you seem to like ""rescuing"" her. The way your talk about her and your vision reminds me of Tom from 500 Days of Summer. I'm not trying to be mean-- this is what I see. 
Also, when you do figure her out will you still be interested? Will you still like her or will the infatuation wear off? We are Fi dominant. That is your weakest function so maybe that's why you find her mysterious and interesting. Maybe you feel like you can learn from her Fi? 
You asked ""Do you find that her constant lack of interest in your intellectual obsession of the moment unfulfilling? Do you ever tire of the shallow level conversations, depressingly nonexistent on the topics of philosophy and the edge of the universe? What is it about her that keeps the bond going strong?"" Ti is what defines you, so I don't understand how you could compromise this. I would actually like to know. Also, I looked at your old posts and you mentioned that you wouldn't be able to be without an N type for life. 
Fi is what defines us, so it's important for us that our SO understand us to the core, and that we feel like we can be authentic in front of them. I tend to connect with stronger Fi users than Fe. In fact, I do not really understand Fe. That said, some parts of your post seem rather sweet. And the Fe shows in your actions.
This relationship will take a lot of effort and you should be 100% sure you like her core before getting her hopes up. When we get hurt or rejected, its hard for us to open up again to anyone. "
5236,isfp,"Just....tell her you really like spending time with her and ask her if she wants to go on an actual date.  Not that hard.  She's probably not going to be the one to take initiative, so you should just go for it.  Save yourself the agony of wondering if she likes you or not.
Also, small note, but I would stop attempting to fix all her problems.  She might like being disorderly and whatnot.  If she asks for your help then go ahead, go for it, but let her do her thing otherwise.  ISFPs generally like to feel independent so she might not enjoy all the handholding in the long run."
5237,isfp,"ahem
What's up intp bromigo? I've got some anecdotal experience here. Isfp got you too huh? I won't give too many personal details about myself because I'm a paranoid, crazy asshole, but the intp perspective should make up for that. 
So, I started off in a different way. We slowly got to know each other, actually before I even knew about mbti. Over 4 and a half years, we grew on each other after 1, started developing ""the liking"" after 2, actually started conversating more after 3, and I told her I was interested after 4. I know the feelings are mutual, but she's yet to actually ""say"" so, if that clues you into how important it is to read actions (don't over analyze though!!!). 
That said, she's choosing to share her time with you. What does that action tell you? I think both of our types have a similar perspective and value on ""me time"". Again, don't overanalyze. Get used to not having things spelled out for you because she won't suddenly ""spit it out"" clearly. That's not to say she can't, but in my experience, their words don't paint the verbal picture that they want. You'll have to take your time and see what the pattern of behavior points to. 
That last sentence is important because you need to draw the line in your head. Enjoy the moment and reflect on new experiences, but try to recognize when you have nothing left to analyze. Over analysis will have you stuck and stressed. 
Also, be careful with helpful suggestions. We naturally find problems and immediately want to problem solve, but this can come off the wrong way. The isfp way is kind of ""whatever, it is what it is - just jump into it"", but hell if doesn't work out more often than not. Just shut up and believe haha. 
Fuck, I spend way too much time on this sub. I need to get away. Anyway, I got you with any questions if you excuse the gaps between responses "
5238,isfp,"imagine you are her, and then see what you would be thinking about. this is easy as fuck imo. plus ppl have thought patterns. maybe when someone snaps they are thinking about a certain thing (I do this). It is very easy to read ppl imo (ISTP), I get bored with everyone except immediate family members really fast soon as I try to ""distill"" them
If someone is going on multiple dates with you there is a 99% chance they like you so be cool"
5239,isfp,"Some simple advice that I can give as a ISFP lady. I suggest being direct and honest about your feelings for her without putting pressure on her to give an immediate response. Make it clear that you are interested in her romantically, and then let her decide if she wants to pursue something with you. It takes me a while to decide as I'm a bit indecisive and have a hard time interpreting my feelings sometimes. 
Also, this is a really bad defense mechanism, but sometimes I'm almost rude to someone I'm interested in, almost to see if they'll ""fight"" for me and try really hard to be with me. I'm not sure if that's a universal ISFP thing, but I definitely send mixed signals and can be hard to understand. Hope this helps."
5240,isfp,"I don't know if this isn't normal for ISFPs as I am kind of isolated and lacking friends at this time in my life, but I think it's always been the case that I make it very obvious if I like a person. My face lights up, I can get excitable and jumpy and start stuttering or blushing. That can mean romantic interest or otherwise. If she is showing no interest you probably don't want to waste your time."
5241,isfp,"~~Tbh I don't see the problem with using the word ""feebleminded"". He(?) already said that it's the best word he could use, and I admit myself, I can also be a bit... short-sighted, maybe?~~ I have an INTP sister who has helped me out on many occasions and who was there for me when I needed her. This story sounds so similar to our interactions. When I think back on it, I really do appreciate all the things that she has done for me, without asking anything back. 
The thing is, I've read that INTPs rarely crave social interactions and that they don't need social validation. It seems kind of like that with my sister. It's hard to express affection or gratitude towards her without it getting a bit awkward. I don't know if she wants my attention or not. When we're together, our interaction is seamless. We understand each others needs so perfectly and there are times when we literally have the same thoughts over stuff. It's just that we don't usually keep contact with each other, and I think it might be related to our types. I've read that INTPs are the kind of types to not initiate contact with people much, and have a mindset of 'out of sight out of mind'. I can understand that, since I'm the same. But because of that, it can be hard to truly read each others intentions.
But I do think INTP-ISFP pairings can work out really well, with lots of understanding and open communication. Seriously, with my INTP sister it's like we're best friends and we can hang out with each other for hours without being exhausted (we do need alone time though). But it's like we always understand each other's needs and we can live with them. It's just neither really knows the other's feelings (,lol).
(edit: I think I've been getting downvotes? I realize that 'feebleminded' was probably not the best word for OP to use after all, although I still don't think it's worth obsessing over a word OP probably didn't really mean anyway.)"
5242,isfp,"Sorry, couldn't think of a nicer word... still can't. As I'm sure you know, INTPs prize intellectual prowess and ability to reason logically, and we're prone to seeing irrationality decision making or behavior in others. Not that I ever call her out on it, I simply help her.
Because I like her and I think she is worth the sacrifice if she is understanding and feels the same way?
I sorta agree, but if there can be mutual benefit, why not?
Can you expand on this? I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this, and I'd appreciate your input."
5243,isfp,"Best post. 
Also, to OP, judging based on behavior and ESPECIALLY stereotypes is a bad, bad way to type anyone. By doing that, for example, my ESTJ dad must actually be an ESxP because why not? He used to be a hippie who smoked pot, was in a rock band, was promiscuous and had (and still has, actually) long hair before he matured. 
But Te is his dominant function. He makes decisions primarily based on what makes objectively the most sense. His Fi is weak; he can definitely be compassionate but he also has a very childish need to have things HIS way, right NOW. I strongly advise you to read up on the cognitive functions, both to understand your lady's type (and who knows, she might well just be an ISFP) and more importantly, what to do here. His Si has led him to build up a lot of skills over the years and have a view of society and life based on his past experiences, and his Ne is impulsive at times and enjoys being sparked by new ideas. I see you mentioned reading Funky MBTI Fiction which is a great resource, as is mbti-notes (run by an INTJ- a real one, not a mistyped, anti-social ISFP/ISTJ like almost everyone is online). Charity on funky and her mods actually do a lot of posts calling out and correcting stereotypes. As for why they aren't accurate, well, why would they be any more than the stereotype that women are obsessed with shoes or Muslims are always conservative? People are individuals. Many ISFPs are hopeless at drawing but might love chemistry. My INTP fiance loved gym class while I, with my strong Se, hated it. 
Also, calling her feeble minded? My INTP  would never call me that, even though he does like to think he's inherently more logical than me (sometimes he is, but that still doesn't make me his intellectual inferior). That wording kind of suggests she's beneath you mentally or is just an idiot."
5244,isfp,"Thanks for your in depth response! 
What about them isn't accurate? I usually use Funky MBTI in Fiction as a data gathering center, and I find their content regarding ISFP makes sense.
This is a very interesting observation.
This is a question I have been asking myself also. Fi is so damn hard to understand no matter how hard I try to. But there's no doubt in my mind if I'm even able to grasp the concept of it relatively well, it would have a positive effect on my life, opening other avenues of possibilities. You hit the nail on the head regarding me 'learning' from her. Now, vice versa, she could do a bit better trying to understand Ti...
I don't see it as a compromise, at all! You're right, Ti defines us, but only the most immature INTP will use it solely to dictate their lives, letting it run wild chaotically. This is disastrous.
Guilty, and I still stand by that statement. I find conversation with N girls to be more engaging. She is mature enough to be able to accommodate my Ne brain poop very well, such as offbeat sarcastic jokes. I can tell she's very comfortable with and enjoys my Ne. But I would be lying to you if I said I didn't wish she was at least a little more imaginative and abstractly thinking. Do you think being exposed to different cognitive functions in relationships help develop weaker ones in each other?
I will try to keep this in mind.
I don't plan on hurting her intentionally, she is such a gentle soul. Which reminds me, she was previously in a relationship for 5 years before the guy told her he didn't like her anymore, and with her being an ISFP I understand it must have wrecked her really hard. This might be one of the reasons why she has been so reluctant to open up to me, but I only ever have good intentions for her."
5245,isfp,"Thanks, that's a great reminder. I've been so preconditioned through past relationships with extroverted feelers to take control and lead"
5246,isfp,"Thanks, your response is very helpful.
How could you possibly spend so much time on this sub if it's so dead in here? Our native home is such a vibrant community of novel, fun, quick-witted discussions daily, it makes this place look like a forsaken tumble weeding desert in comparison. Just being honest, fellow ISFPs, no need to get your panties bunched over an innocent quip"
5247,isfp,"This is so angering! It's hard for me to understand why it's so difficult to just be more transparent so both parties can best understand each other. No two people walk into a business meeting hiding as much of their intentions as possible from each other
But thanks, I will just tell her I really like her, see where she goes from there and adjust as needed"
5248,isfp,"I really do appreciate all the things that she has done for me, without asking anything back.
That attitude is different. I believe love is giving without expecting something back. There's that. Then relying on others to complete us. There's that. That's why I said he needs to figure himself out first. Why not just use stupid? :) if I suggest to you that it's offensive to me, and you don't see the problem, then maybe you have some wiring problems yourself. hahaha at any rate, he calls her stupid so I'm erring on the side of caution here when I say it doesn't look good. :P"
5249,isfp,"What a refreshing perspective. Although in the form of siblings and not dating partners, a lot of the communication issues between INTP/ISFP is still relevant. I agree that constant contact isn't required between the two; my situation in particular we only send handfuls of texts to each other throughout the week and save it all up for a day on the weekend instead. 
I guess I need to be more forthcoming and ask her what really is going on between us. ISFP's mysteriousness is hairsplitting yet attractive at the same time!
Do you ever find it hard to keep up with your sister intellectually? Like, if you guys were out having a cup of coffee together and she decides to brain poop everything onto you(usually in the form of her latest obsession), do you slough on and try to maintain a healthy back and forth, or is it so draining and uninteresting that it is bothersome to you?"
5250,isfp,"You believe you're lacking. You have the ability to improve in certain areas and so does she. She doesn't need your help and vice versa. You sound codependent. If you want to go ahead anyway although you already said she drives you crazy, trust me it won't get better because right now you're being as good as you can be, making your best impression, putting your best foot forward, both of you but that's as good as you both can be, it won't get better than this. And if it's not going to get better, what does that leave? This always happens. Then you'll end up having a baby and a life of hell. And go: how did this happen to me? haha why did God do this to me? hahaha"
5251,isfp,I couldn't come up with a better way to say it while keeping things concise and not an unnecessarily long paragraph explaining why she's smart but isn't exactly the sharpest tool when it comes to certain things. She's not beneath me mentally nor is she an idiot.
5252,isfp,"What isfp stereotypes on Funkymbti make you think she is isfp?
To be honest (and I don't mean to be mean) you sound selfish but don't realize it. You admit you don't know much about her, and admit that you still prefer a N girl for life. What does she get? Sure, you help her with organization and stuff, but what does she get in the long term? 
An ENTP lady in another forum said she dated an isfp because she thought he was fascinating and his mind mysterious. But after a while, she found out his Fi did not hold the mysteries of the universe and she lost interest. She realized Fi was just subjectiveness and individuality. Fi lovers need their lovers to appreciate them as a person, not a Pandora's box.
What do you mean by abstract and imaginative? We're capable of this as long as it aligns with our interests. Just like how I was talking about mbti. She's not going to put much time and effort into understanding she doesn't care personally about (Fi) unlike someone who likes to think about anything they find a little interest in, so we are capable of abstract and imaginative convo, just in stuff we are actually really interested in. 
It's possible to strengthen your weaker functions by being exposed to them. My Inxp sister only reveals her Ti to me when angry, and it's made me better at debating logically. But it's a slow process for everyone involved. I can't say it'll work for you and her because I've lived with my sister all my life. She may change, she may not. But you should be sure you like her for who she is before getting into a relationship and trying to change her.
I suggest you get to know her better as a person before initiating any further. May hurt her if she becomes interested but you already lost interest. Especially after her break up. You did mention you would leave if her Fi was ""too irrational"""

5254,isfp,"Ah you know, the eternal search for truth and understanding. I do my research here, then head back to home sub. There's isn't a lot said here, but there are 100% less shit posts, so there's less bullshit to sift through, if any. 
Also, I wouldn't say Isfps really bunch their panties that easily  - the hyper sensitivity is pretty exaggerated in mbti, except in the unhealthy ones, like every type has. But the preemptive justification won't exactly win you any friends either"
5255,isfp,"Yeah, I'd say let a bit of that inferior Fe out :p
Talking about her obsessions, idk, I might fall back a bit, usually because I don't relate to her obsession. But I'd still try listen to her and affirmate that I know what she's talking about. "
5256,isfp,"Dude if you really can't think of a better way to refer to a girl you claim to be really interested in a LTR with then ""feeble minded"", then either you don't know what the term means or you aren't as intellectual as you think :)
No offense but ""feeble minded"" is one of the most insulting things you can call someone. If you said that to her face she would likely never talk to you again.
Aside from that you seem pretty shy about making your intentions known to her. If you have been hanging out with her every weekend and she agreed to go to a wedding with you then she is definitely interested. You need to man up and make a move to show her your intentions. Just kiss her already!"
5257,isfp,"Practically all of them, when I study the cognitive functions and incorporate my observations of her the numerous times we've spent time together. I would bet a lot, a lot of money that she is ISFP and nothing else. Definitely introvert, absolutely sensing, painfully obvious feeler, and no question a perceiver. Actually, I've never been more certain of typing anyone than I have for her, even myself. Emotionally withdrawn, quiet, trouble conveying things into words, an eye for aesthetics, an extreme sense of her surroundings in the moment. During a sensitive conversation between the two of us, I told her she can seem like a closed book at times, and that I had trouble understanding her. Her response?
""Yeah, you won't.""
Does that not scream ISFP? I also told her how I wanted to bleach my hair platinum blond(it's a professionally acceptable jet black at the moment) and I asked her for her opinion on it, and she said it would look nice on me. But then I told her how I might compromise my professional image and she became defensive all of a sudden, telling me how I should be able to do what I want as an individual, and that it's not up to my boss to dictate what color my hair is. In another scene, we were both driving in the car, and I asked her what she thought of the genre of a specific song playing on the radio. She proceeds to tell me the song in particular was making her feel really sad at the moment, and afterwards, I noticed her wiping away tears several times. I asked if everything was okay and if she wanted to talk about it, but she didn't answer me and I left it at that. We texted about it afterwards(though vaguely), and she gave the impression that it was nothing serious or profound, just a heat of the moment lost in her emotions. She was quite happy and talkative a short while later, so yeah.
I believe these are concrete examples of ISFP behavior, unless you'd like to point out otherwise.
You might be right in saying this. But I'm desperately trying to find the answer to the question of what she gets in the long term, but a closed book will not have much answers without deeper prying.
I... can imagine this happening to me.
Abstract and imaginative like, y'know, N stuff concerning random topics. But you're right, she cares deeply about animal suffering and being environmentally conscious, two things that align extremely well with my own passions, and we have some engaging talks about the stuff.
Appreciate the honesty. I will keep in mind to like her for who she is instead of who I can possibly shape her into.
I'm also starting to think this is the best course of action. I've built up this early idealized notion of her, just as you mentioned, and I'm afraid this lofty image might come crashing down one day after the initial butterflies wears off and a clearer picture of her is revealed. What I got from everything you parlayed is that Fi is not a thing to be understood, but to be simply appreciated. If I cannot do this, it will not work. Yesterday marked the fifth time we've made time for each other during the weekend, I think it's now obvious there is at least some continued mutual interest. All I wish is for her to play a bigger role in trying to bridge the gap instead of taking such a passive stance that leaves me feeling empty. If things stay this way(and they have thus far), even after more prolonged exposure to each other and having a talk to get things straight, I might have to pack my bags and move on.
You give very sound advice and I appreciate all of it."
5258,isfp,"Ah, so true about the shit posts.
I'm assuming ya'll are still together? How are things? Do you find that her constant lack of interest in your intellectual obsession of the moment unfulfilling? Do you ever tire of the shallow level conversations, depressingly nonexistent on the topics of philosophy and the edge of the universe? What is it about her that keeps the bond going strong?"
5259,isfp,"Shed some light on what would have been the appropriate word or words to use without being insulting. 
That is quite the bold proclamation, I just might do it next time the opportunity presents itself. "
5260,isfp,"Could be any introverted type. Or just plain shy.
I'm an ISFP but not like that at all. I look like shit lol. My inxp sister cares more about fashion and looking good. She also tells me I don't pay attention to my surroundings. 
Sounds like Fi dominant. Also enneagram 4. Possible isfp 4?
Sounds like any moody Feeler type (moodiness is something I struggle with but not all isfps are like this).
From what you wrote, she could be an isfp. But it's hard to accurately type without knowing her better. 
Can you give me example of convo between 2 N types? 
You can understand Fi. All you have to do is understand the person deeply. Because Fi cannot really be understood like typical abstract concepts. Just like Ti is good at rationally understanding systems, Fi is good at understanding your value system. Someone who depends primarily on Fi acts according to their morals and principles (which is not always rational) so it looks confusing to you. Everyone has different experiences and ways of interpreting them so Fi is very subjective and you can't really pin down the ""rules"" of Fi. 
And also.
You seem to like the idea of the perfect lady. I creeped your profile again (if you're uncomfortable with this I'll stop), and you asked in another forum where you could find the ""enchanting infj""? You have to love the person, not the perfect image you have in your head. Keep in mind she may take this relationship more seriously than you. If you don't take her seriously, don't see any long-term potential with her, you will end up hurting her a lot, for selfish reasons. "
5261,isfp,"First off I am an INTP so I know what you intended. I just hope you have the sense to know how offensive this would be to her. You could describe her as ""not analytical/rational"" or ""better at feelings and emotions then logic"". Something like that and we get the point. 
Feeble-minded sounds like a person with an IQ of under 70 :)
Anyway I have an ISFP girl I really like, but definitely not recommended for LTR. They generally lack a good sense of humor, live by the book and don't like to question authority or think outside the box from my experience. At least by INTP standards."
5262,isfp,"Ah, sucks it ended up being that way. I feel like if it ever came to that point for me, where her Fi is so irrational, I might have to move on. 
I'm happy to hear that conversations bode well, and I find my ISFP does the same. I'll randomly bring up something and she listens as if I'm the only person in the world. She won't debate back or nudge me further, but reciprocates back with a peek into her life like you said. For instance, two weeks ago I revealed to her that I was an extreme introvert and must recharge after each session of heavy socialization. She proceeded to randomly tell me that she was very observant person of the world around her. I thought it an out-of-place thing to say, but it does make sense because of Se and ISFPs inability to accurately convey feelings into words."
5263,isfp,Then why are you interested in dating her? How are you so sure she's not thinking any relationship may have long-term potential? You're a hypocrite as well as condescending. What you said is just as offensive if not more offensive than what OP said. At least he said it because he wasn't concise. You seem to mean every word. 
5264,isfp,"Really? ISFPs have a pretty big reputation for being rebellious  (even if that may mean different things to each one...Fi being super subjective as it is of course). I haven't known any as you describe (I am one, friends with a couple, related to one, read up on several ISFP celebrities). Are you certain of their type?
As for humor, maybe they just don't find your jokes funny üôÑ One ISFP friend loves The Big Bang Theory. I only find it sometimes funny but mostly forced and I prefer MST3K style jokes, usually. (Again though, pretty subjective).
Not to get all self-justifying, I was just surprised by that description."
5265,isfp,"Thinking of it as irrational makes it harder for me to accept. I see it as indecisiveness, which we can relate to. Naturally, I think it's easier to figure out what ""makes sense"" than what's ""right"", but I can empathize with how complicated that must be. 
Yeah, the reciprocation is great. Knowing a lot about an isfp is a bit like being in a vip room with how exclusive it is (I hope I'm not romanticizing here). It really is about reading actions though. The personal sharing seems to say ""I know how you feel, you're not alone"". "
5266,isfp,"Maybe you just haven't met a lot of isfps. Or maybe you don't know a lot on a deep level. My Inxp sister assumes a lot of things about me and she's wrong sometimes, even though we've known each other since we were little. Assumptions are just assumptions."

Other introverts will sometimes bring me down. But introverts in my life that I‚Äôm close to are really enjoyable to be around because we can either sit comfortably in silence or we can have quiet conversations about things that interest us. "
5269,isfp,"I feel alive around people who let me be myself, who don't text me everyday, who don't try to make me conform to their expectations, and who are honest, more than everything else.
I feel awful with the kind of people who text you everyday, all day, who subtly make everything go in THEIR direction, who blow hot and cold, who try to control everything, and who lie. Also, I hate loud people."
5270,isfp,"I'm an ISFP who is going through what I think maybe an identity crisis. Basically, I don't know who I am--I feel as though I have no idea who I am, or what is my purpose on this planet. I constantly try to please people, even at the expense of my own feelings and needs. For example, I have no desire to have society considers a great career (things such as engineering, medicine, law, business, etc.). My dream is to become a librarian and artist.  Whenever I tell people this, I get funny looks, and I start to reevaluate my life goals. It's as though I'm trying please all of society. 
I've never fit in. Ever since I was a little girl, I've always felt like an outsider obeserving the rest of society. I don't think I' e come across another person I can relate to. I have a tendency to get strange insights and feelings about people and situations, but whenever I tell people about these insights, they look at me like I'm crazy or start yelling at me, as though they think I'm strange. I enjoy talking about various theories and ideas, but I can't seem to find anyone who enjoys talking about these things. 
I feel as though I behave like a robot. I don't express my emotions easily, and this seems to disturb most people. I get annoyed by people who express their emotions in an over-the-top fashion. I'm not a bubbly person by any means, and this gets me labeled as ""cold"" or a ""bitch"". 
I'm struggling to fit in with the world. The only times I truly feel comfortable is when I'm around ""artistic"" or ""intellectual"" people, and when I'm with my family. I just can't relate to people who love to ""live in the moment"" and are care-free, which seems to be most people my age (I'm 22). I'm wondering if any other ISFPs struggle with fitting in with society as much as I do. "
5271,isfp,"dude, I relate. I kinda stopped thinking about it though, except for occasionally wondering if I seem weird to others. I just don't care about the same things as everyone else does. I basically do what I like, but I still struggle finding something to do that I love (and, motivation). Also people say ''follow your heart'' and ''follow your dreams'' like it's simple, but what does that mean? I am already following my heart. I am listening to my ''heart'' in every choice I make in my everyday life. And sometimes it feels like following my heart isn't necessarily the same as following my dreams either. 
Anyway, I have considered being a photographer. Cliche, I know, but it fits my lifestyle and I like taking photos. I recommend finding something you love doing as well, and not really caring about expectations and fitting in with society. (Of course, the choice is ultimately yours. I don't know how you work, so my advice might not necessarily fit with you.)"
5272,isfp,"Same here. I feel pretty lonely most days, I try to share my excitement with others but... it's usually met with blank stare or this questioning like ""Why would you be interested in that?"" My family is basically the only place I can find a little bit of... encouragement.
I'm finding that it's best just to keep my thoughts and ideas to myself. It kind of sucks, but I rather do that than have so of my ideas shot down by the world. People tell me I'm really quiet and I don't talk... usually it's because when I've told them thing they didn't want to listen. 
It's frustrating, but you're not alone."
5273,isfp,"I think it's fantastic that you want to be a librarian or artist! Don't listen to what society says. Follow your dreams!
I really relate to the feeling of not knowing who you are. Sometimes it's like everyone knows themselves but me. 
I also relate to feeling like a robot. I feel weird and kind of fake expressing emotion, and I can hardly ever do it authentically, as much as I might try. And often I just don't feel enthusiastic, which makes me seem kind of unfeeling.
I don't know if I don't fit into society, but I often don't fit into social settings, which mostly comes from being adverse to social interaction, shy, and not knowing about a lot of the things people like to talk about. "
5274,isfp,"I'm pretty much the same, I don't feel like anyone WOULD understand me, (in caps because I've never tried to open my self up to anyone like that) I act minimally with everyone besides my couple of friends and my family,  even to them I don't reveal all of myself to them.
I too also think I have a ""resting bitch face"" which definitely turns people away. I have a very monotone voice (reasons for I don't even want to tell on the internet) and I act pretty tame or chill most of the time. I don't talk to anyone I don't have to so I would say I don't fit in the world at all. I would however say that I am a live in the moment/care free person. don't please anyone to the point of changing yourself because of their opinion besides yourself and those you really care about. you know what you want to be in life so you're a step ahead of me, therefore not everyone's better than you, and it's easy to forget other people have trials, troubles, or problems, so don't think anyone's perfect"
5275,isfp,"Yup, I can relate with having trouble fitting in with most people. Sometimes it feels like so even around people that I may consider friends. Being a quiet person by nature and finding it difficult to open up to people in general definitely doesn't help things much either.
In the past I used to wonder if anything was wrong with me, why is it that just about everyone else seemed like they can talk to people and make friends so easily while I can't? Mainly the talking part though, I've since realised that I'm satisfied with having just a few close friends whom I can open up to and truly be myself around, over having more not-so-close friends whom I cannot be myself around. It definitely does feel lonely sometimes though. XD
Also, it's good that you already know what you want to do at your age, and you should definitely go for it! :D"
5276,isfp,"I dj. I hate that I have to adjust my life to financial stability.
I just think you are in the wrong company. There are so many people like you, well not exactly but close and these are the people you want to surround yourself with.
But I definitely suggest that you try to do this. Don't know how tho. I relax with weed and music, but to you that might be anything. 
You will. But you kinda have to look around for it and get out from you comfort zone."
5277,isfp,"Yesterday my ex contacted me (after 3 months of not talking to each other). I was surprised, but also relieved for reasons I couldn't explain. I thought I didn't want him anymore, but at that time I wanted to do nothing but talk to him. I was in a low mood. He said to me that he was worried about me and wanted to know how I was doing. It didn't seem like he had any bitter/resentful thoughts towards me. Still, when we talked again it was like we had never stopped talking. There was that same intense feeling of fondness towards him. I was so glad at that time. I appreciated his concern towards me, and truthfully I still appreciate him. But I just can't figure out my feelings towards him?? It's like I consider him as a close friend, but at that moment I felt love, but was it platonic love? I don't think it was. I don't think it was romantic either? I think it was somewhere in between. I felt that same closeness when I had been talking to him (texting) earlier. I feel like I shouldn't abandon him, but I also don't want to run into his arms declaring I would never leave him. It's like I'm really glad he's in my life but I still want to keep him at an arms length. He said that he would like to meet me again, but only if I wanted to. I can't figure out the ""do I want"" part. Does anyone else relate to indecisiveness when it comes to romantic feelings? Do you think my issue with him stems from incompatibility or something else? Am I being a horrible romantic partner? I feel like I should be honest towards my feelings here, and I also feel like he wants me to do the same. Anyways thanks for reading this romantic rant.
edit: I think I found my problem, which is that I'm trying to label things too much. Still, it feels weird."
5278,isfp,You‚Äôre not weird about love at all.  The push/pull you feel towards this guy is perfectly normal.  This is someone you dated and had feelings for.  Obviously you‚Äôre going to have mixed emotions talking to him again.  And that‚Äôs ok!  Love is a complicated mess and usually doesn‚Äôt totally make sense.  Just take some time to process things and do whatever you think is right
5279,isfp,"It‚Äôs not specific to ISFP, but check out the Personality Hacker podcast, episode 225.
In general, it‚Äôs a cool podcast for anyone interested in personality types and how they affect our daily interactions. Episode 225 delves into how to determine the cognitive function stack for each personality type."
5280,isfp,"Your functions are Fi Se Ni Te, in that order. Fi and  Se are your conscious functions, which means they are under your control, and Ni and Te are your subconscious functions, which means they are less under your control. Fi is introverted feeling, Se is extroverted sensing, Ni is introverted intuition, and Te is extroverted thinking. Fi is to do with your personal moral values, what is right and wrong to you, such as being authentic, being honest, and being true to yourself. I find that these are common ISFP values, though they might not be true for all ISFPs. Each ISFP decides what his personal values are. Se is how you express those values. Namely, Se is your ‚Äòdoing‚Äô function, so you prefer to express your values through your deeds rather than your words. This is what I like most about ISFPs, you are doers, not talkers.
Of course there‚Äôs a lot more to Se than that, but that‚Äôs a good overview, and you can look up how subconscious Ni and Te effects your psyche at the other aforementioned websites. I hope this helped you start off. Happy self-discovery."
5281,isfp,"Hey guys, I just wanted to know if any of you guys have had this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù...
For the past 2 years I was convinced that I was an INFP despite not totally identifying with all of the traits (I.e. being super emotional, being an strong writer, and being a social justice warrior/hella empathetic)
After reading the ISFP description I‚Äôm pretty sure that I am an ISFP and not an INFP. However I‚Äôve taken the MBTI 5 tines and come out as INFP every time. 
Idk anyone else had that?"
5282,isfp,"Online tests are never** a good idea. Please read up cognitive functions descriptions for Fi, Se, Ne, Ni, Si, Te (there are posts on personalitycafe by Lenore Thompson which explains each). 
Both ISFPs and and INFPs have Introverted Feeling (Fi) as their dominant/first function. You most likely to be IXFP if you relate strongly to Fi. 
From there it diverges, your secondary function will either be Extroverted Sensing (Se) if you're ISFP, and Extroverted Intuition (Ne) if you're INFP whichever you feel describes you better is the one. 
Also the tertiary, Introverted Intuition (Ni) for ISFP and Introverted Sensing (Si) for INFP should help confirm your type. We share the same inferior/ last function that is Extroverted Thinking (Te).
ISFP has Fi, Se, Ni, Te
INFP has Fi, Ne, Si, Te 
Read the ISFP/ INFP description from 16personalities.com, personally I prefer their type descriptions over others."
5283,isfp,"I always test as ENFP. It's weird cuz I definitely have some of the Ne dom traits, but isfp just feels right.
I'm a musician, people always describe me as the super chill guy, and I just can't relate to the overly bubbly ENFP stereotype. Afterall, there aren't just 16 personalities, more like 7.5 billion. "

5286,isfp,"I actually used to picture things very vividly, and instantaneously. Of course this annoying kid on my bus realized this, and would torture me with ridiculous, gross, scary mental images.
After that, I trained myself not to. Now it's kind of difficult for me to get a decent mental image because I suppressed it for so long."
5287,isfp,"A google search brought me here, seeing two diferent isfp where one has aphantasia and the other doesn't weakens my idea but I'll throw it out here since it doesn't completely break it... 
I'm tempted to think that aphantasia might be related to Ni, because IMO Ni is about deriving patterns and ideas from experiences and apply them to the present to predict future events. One who doesn't have a developed mind's eye will naturally use abstract thoughts or ideas because their grip in the past is very weak. Though, as I was writing this I thought Se might result from exactly the same reasons but where one simply focus on the present sensations instead of abstract ideas.
One thing I would find really strange would be a Si dominant or secondary with aphantasia, as I would break my understanding of the function.
These are just a couple of thoughts from a random ENTJ "
5288,isfp,"Not many people have replied so it's hard to get a good idea, but I think it might just be a random thing across the types.
I never really know how to explain it because I've never known anything else. When I close my eyes to 'visualise' something I see black. Just black. Only black. I think is why I hated reading growing up. I could never bring the descriptions to life like in a movie. It's easier for me to have my eyes open when I 'visualise' things because I can use my environment. It's hard to explain but I liken it to drawing something invisible over the top of the environment I see. If I was visualising a plane I would be able to draw in my mind the basic outline for it, move it around, scale it, flip it in my mind to create a story of what it's doing, and add senses in there to make it more realistic. For example, moving my head to follow it around, moving my mouth and voicebox into the position of the sounds I think it would make (but not actually making the sounds, it just helps me visualise sounds), opening up my sense of touch to what I might feel. It's very hard to explain, and I've tried to explain it a lot.
Sometimes if I'm trying to picture a face or something with my eyes close it will all be black and there will be a blurry silhouette of the things I'm visualising that's a bit blacker than the rest. 
I've talked to a few people about how I fantasise and create scenarios in my head to masturbate to, and it's a lot different to what they describe. They all tended to create whole story lines with lots of visualised details whereas I find that nearly impossible to do unless I describe it as if I was writing it down. I mostly just use a moment in time and get caught up in how that would feel, taste, sound like, be positioned etc. Not a picture.
Hope that paints a picture of what it's like for me."
5289,isfp,"I've never really thought of going to a kind of therapist for it because until recently it was never something that I picked up that was hindering me or different from what others were experiencing. Even now, I'm cautious about going to a therapist to change the way it all appears in my brain, because who am I to say that people aren't all experiencing the world in a unique way different to others? There's Multiple Intelligences (Gardners) so who's to say that there's more than mine and your way of processing the world.
I guess it would be good to see if someone could make me picture things ""normally"" but I'm not sure how possible that could be if my brain has already gone through creating the neural pathways it has as it seems pretty major.
I'd maybe be interested in undergoing research to explain why it happens, rather then trying to ""fix"" it.
My memory can be good and bad, it depends what I'm asked to remember. I'm absolutely horrible connecting faces and names (don't talk to me about actors in movies because I won't know who you're talking about). I recall in primary school not being too great at comprehension tests but I was a pretty smart kid in school (even high school and now uni) and get good grades. I think I remember things best when I can make connections to my prior knowledge or if it's relatable to something I can extend on. I do tend to remember some small seemingly insignificant details though and people are quite surprised when I remember those details. This happens recalling what people were wearing, things that happened while something else was happening, a specific branch off a thought that happened when talking to someone, how someone moves their body or facial features, or specific features of an environment. I'm pretty good with maps (Not amazing but not hopeless).
I was talking to a friend on the weekend who I had mentioned this to before. She said she was also talking to her friend about how I don't see images, and her friend (who loves literature) said she sees words in her mind. I don't get that either. Its hard to pin point a ""normal"" when there's no objective perception of the world. "
5290,isfp,"My mum is actually an ENFP. I love her a lot, and we have a brilliant relationship.
Pros: she‚Äôs very warm and loving. She‚Äôs a brilliant parent and I‚Äôm so happy to have her. She also works in a very caring job helping those less fortunate. She‚Äôs great at what she does and I look up to her a lot. She‚Äôs also been rather ill lately (alright now) and she suffered very silently. Didn‚Äôt impose it on anyone, just got through it. I respect that strength a lot. Another thing is that she‚Äôll always help me, she‚Äôs rather wise. If I‚Äôm confused on something, or need a bit of help, she‚Äôll help and comfort me a lot.
Cons: Not any genuinely bad things.However - she talks a lot. Like, I‚Äôll ask a question which really needs a basic answer, and she‚Äôll go onnnn. Or she‚Äôll say something, I‚Äôm like ‚Äúokay I get it‚Äù and she‚Äôll continue explaining it. I wouldn‚Äôt call that an issue tho. I‚Äôll also find sometimes she can unintentionally make you feel guilty. I love her, and always try to do everything I can. But if I don‚Äôt want to do something, I‚Äôll see her get visibly upset or bothered and it kinda just leads me to do it. She can be pretty emotional. Not that emotional scares an ISFP though!"
5291,isfp,"good things - no awkward conversations and very outgoing 
bad things- no filter ( which can be even worse w isfp because eg: I never express myself whenever something offends me) very needy and dependent to the point of it being unhealthy and not knowing how to function without a significant other 
(disclaimer this is all from my personal experience not facts)"
5292,isfp,"Today I learned that I am an ISFP.... holy crap. It's me on the spot.
I always wondered why I couldn't understand abstract ideas that I couldn't visualize.
I always felt stuck in my head in social situations that I felt uncomfortable in. It was like my brain just shut down and words, opinions, contributions halted. Silence. I was so frustrated with myself. I would just observe and listen instead. Sometimes adding in a word here and there.
This ESPECIALLY happened around people who I felt I needed to make a good impression on like in-laws, employers, etc. 
I would get so exhausted trying to function in these situations.
I am such an in-the-moment person and I struggle to plan out my career and life but I am in a pretty good path now. I have a boyfriend who is very on the ball with coordinating life and thinking ahead to the future so I am lucky.
I hate drama.
I am not a materialistic person.
I hate fake people.
I hate conflict, but I am much better at dealing with it than I used to be.
I am sensitive to energies and other peoples emotions/moods, for example, if someone is pissed off, even if no one else notices, I do, and it affects me in a way I cant explain. I makes me kind of uncomfortable and dampens my mood. I always want to help fix the problem.
I have pretty high self esteem which goes against the norm for ISFP types and I am confident in my abilities and who I am except in the socialization area. 
I am learning to speak my mind and verbalize emotions much better than I used to.
I have a nice few close people in my life that I can be my complete self around which I love and I spend time with them the most. I never get exhausted spending time with them.
I feel like my whole entire life just makes sense now. I feel so normal and just relieved that there's nothing wrong with my brain. I am just an ISFP!
Anyone else in the same boat as me? lol"
5293,isfp,I have just realized that I am an ISFP and I am in my early 30's. Welcome to the party lol How did you realize you were this type? Did you ever think you were a different type? I was in denial for most of my 20's thinking I was more of an introvert but now I am really embracing my quieter nature.
5294,isfp,I am! I literally started crying when I read about ISFP's. My problems with expressing myself and feeling exhausted during conversations finally made sense. It's a relief to have some understanding. What are your career plans?
5295,isfp,OMG this is exactly writing about me. I have experienced all the words u said. Yeah thank you so much for speaking my heart. I'm definititely an in-the-moment person. I can get engaged easily in those kinds of stuff I like. I think I'm better at socializing and expressing myself now. But the thing is Im still stuck in my career path. I would love to discuss with u guys more about our ISFP personality. Thanks so much! Cheers for us!
5296,isfp,I randomly took a personality quiz called 16 personality types or something and it gave an in-depth explanation of your personality type in the end. I actually welled up with tears of joy and disbelief of what I was reading. I could never really figure myself out completely all my life and I never knew why. But I do now. I guess its hard to feel like you fit in when all the people who are more apt to talk to you are outgoing different personalities. All the ISFP's are hiding lol!. Reddit is an awesome place for this stuff and I'm so happy I found this as well.
5297,isfp,"Same! I was like what is wrong with me? but now I know its nothing :) It just me! I went to university and got a psychology degree but didn't do anything with it and went straight back to school for architectural engineering technology (I'm 25 btw). I like drawing and houses interest me so that fit well. I always wanted to be able to help people as well so maybe plans will change in the future to something more fulfilling but I really enjoy the program I am in now and plan on getting work with it. Ya know, just living in the moment taking it day by day haha!"
5298,isfp,"I always had him pinned as ISFP.
Some people said they think he's more INFP. 
One post pissed me off. It said ""He could be a sensor, just a more intellectual sensor."" like us sensors are just inherently stupid. 
But anyways, I'd like your opinion. 
I feel like he's an ISFP. 
I've also seen INTP soo..."
5299,isfp,"He's like RLY INFP imo, he sweats INFP in all his body, come on! i don't see him as an ISFP at all.
Just read his suicide not, he is ashamed of not beeing capable of ""feel the moment"", i readed his whole biography and stuff, if he's ISFP, im not ISFP and i dont get MBTI at all"
5300,isfp,"Maybe they meant intellectual as in intellectual sensing vs physical sensing.  If they meant that sensors are less intelligent, they should have written, ""more intelligent sensor.""
I see him as a strong INFP, but who knows, I didn't know him IRL. 
What makes you go for the ISFP as opposed to an N?"
5301,isfp,"This is just my opinion based on my own observations and understanding of mbti, but I get the impression that infps have more ""inner turmoil"", exploring and getting lost in all the conflicting thoughts and feelings. Whereas isfps are more like always striving for an end goal of harmony within themselves and with those around them. Ne-Si vs Se-Ni. Because of this I've never questioned Cobain's infpness because of the whole inner turmoil thing."
5302,isfp,"He just really gives me a sensor esq vibe when I hear him talk and the things he does in stage.  Like, it seems to me that sensors tend to be more reckless and whatnot. Also, a common theme I've noticed among ISFP song writers is they all, for the most part, have said something like ""when I write I don't make it with some deeper meaning. It's just how I was feeling at the time."" a lot of Kurt's music seems like that. Like, he would write poems a lot and then just pick and pull from poems to make a song. 
He never really sounded like an N type to me as well. Ne looks at the future for possibilities. Kurt didn't seem that way to me. He really just seemed to live in the moment. 
But I could be wrong. :p"
5303,isfp,"I find almost all of his lyrics are about weird shit and not rly about experiences except some songs.
for example:
Underneath the bridge
The tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Like, who even knows what he's rly talking about dude"
5304,isfp,"Curious to see if there are others similar to me, as I have yet to meet someone that is anywhere near similar.
I‚Äôm a 24 year old average female, and an ISFP, which I believe may add some insight as to why I enjoy being alone. I‚Äôm very much in the moment and I‚Äôm horrible at planning, whether it‚Äôs short term or long term. 
I have never once been in a relationship or desired a relationship, although I‚Äôve had many opportunities to have one. I have a guy friend currently that I enjoy talking to and is undoubtedly attracted to me and doesn‚Äôt shy in letting me know, but as soon as I even envision being in a relationship I get a sort of anxiety and ignore any advance at dating. 
I have many friends that are married, dating, or cannot emotionally be single and must always be in a relationship, that have been puzzled as to how I could possibly be content and full on my own. I‚Äôve even had a friend ask to tell her friend how great it is to be single and not need to constantly search for male interaction. It felt very odd trying to explain how I‚Äôve always been, just as she would feel odd explaining why she feels the need to have a constant companion. I‚Äôm somehow the friend that gives amazing advice without even having experience in relationships, having the ability to observe everything I‚Äôve seen and put it together for a specific problem or question a friend is having.
I understand that it‚Äôs the societal norm for humans to seek relationships, so I‚Äôm not shocked that my family and acquaintances are always wondering what it is about me, why am I so odd that I wouldn‚Äôt want to date. How could I not want to date? I don‚Äôt have an answer. I just am what I am. 
I have a feeling it‚Äôs a mixture of how relaxed and independent I am, and that I‚Äôm so comfortable and full on my own that the idea of ‚Äúfinding your other half‚Äù is so baffling and unfamiliar to me. Maybe I‚Äôll date in the future, maybe I won‚Äôt. My ISFP personality confirms that I don‚Äôt worry about the future, and would love for my family and friends to understand that I truly am happy with myself for now. 
Would love to know if anyone else feels the same! I‚Äôve searched many times and somehow have not come up with much."
5305,isfp,"I've been in a 4 year relationship and it honestly baffles me how my SO can't stand to be alone at any time, if im ever gone for a night she just goes to her parents, meanwhile if shes gone for a week I love my time to myself. 
Honestly half of me feels like im a bad boyfriend for not missing her all the time but I'm way too contempt with being by myself in a lot of situations so I can see how you wouldn't seek out anybody. I never really did because I was always happy doing my own thing but she was pretty relentless in her chase and I eventually caved. 
Im sure you will eventually find someone if that's something you decide to do but it will probably be an impulse decision if your anything like me.  "
5306,isfp,"I can relate to you OP. 
I'm 20 (male and also ISFP) and while I have dated a handful of times in my life they rarely lasted longer than a couple of weeks. 
They always ended because I would become bored with the individual and did not see the point or reality of a relationship nor felt anything ""special"" that would mystically attatch myself to them.
I was always curious about relationships and since I am very open minded and easy going, the girls I dated were girls that would actually approach me and be very direct about wanting to be with me so I would accept them to satisfy my curiosities about relationships and to be polite. (I have a hard time saying no and I hate to hurt people's feelings.)
They would take me places, hold my hand, kiss me, cuddle, all the things you see in those romantic movies but I never felt a thing. It confused me because I am a very emotional person but I was just not engaged in this form of emotion. 
It made me feel like a puppet to be honest and that was uncomfortable for me. 
So I would always break off the relationships the same way by purposely doing things to annoy the person so they would dump me so I wouldn't have to do it myself and hurt them. 
Looking back, I think I am the sort of person that has close bonds and affections for people I am directly tied too (familial bonds or close friendships) but the idea of bonds closer than the bonds I have confuse me and I don't feel a need for them. 
I'm happy enough to hug my family, spend time with them, hang out with friends and have meaningful conversations but there's no need for affection beyond that I would seek. Romantic affection just seems unnecessary to me.
I feel comfortable in my personal world and to have to make room for someone else would be too invasive for me.
I'll always be content with what I have and I don't see a point in changing. "
5307,isfp,I can relate to you. I'm in my late 20's and value autonomy and self-independence. But I would not associate this with being an ISFP. Being aromantic or asexual is probably a more accurate reason for feeling this way.
5308,isfp,"Your SO sounds a lot like my sister in law who absolutely cannot sleep if my brother works at night. I obviously can‚Äôt understand the feeling of needing company and constantly thinking of that company when they aren‚Äôt with you, just as those people wouldn‚Äôt understand and are baffled by why I DON‚ÄôT need that. 
I think it‚Äôs just so ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to be in a relationship and if you aren‚Äôt, you‚Äôre viewed as lonely, in between relationships, or something‚Äôs off with you. Wish it was a little more understood that some people enjoy their own company and it‚Äôs entirely normal.
As for you feeling like a bad boyfriend, try not to compare your feelings while away with the feelings your SO has while away. Some need time to themselves to recharge even in relationships, and it‚Äôs always healthy to have your own time! 
Like I said, I‚Äôm not a great planner and I don‚Äôt particularly worry about the future. It may not be the best trait, but everything remains possible and I have all the time to seek a relationship if I choose to in the future. "
5309,isfp,"Thank you for your response! Your viewpoint is very much like mine. I‚Äôm a very emotional and empathetic person, I can get really into romance in novels or films, and I have very strong bonds with my family and friends.
At the very second I feel a guy is interested in me I back away and slowly (or quickly, if he‚Äôs persistent) fade from him, and the more they show their feelings towards me the more uneasy I feel. It just all feels so unnatural to me and unnecessary, as you said. I‚Äôm happy with friendships and strong bonds and would prefer naturally getting to know guys without the ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù label. No need for haste in my eyes, haha. 
It may come off as selfish to some, as I‚Äôve been told before, but being content on your own and being comfortable with your life in the moment is all that matters. I feel no need of changing that for now, and I always have to satisfy those amused acquaintances with the usual ‚Äúmaybe in the future ¬Ø(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø ‚Äú"
5310,isfp,"Here comes trouble, no I'm just joshing around. Who am I kidding? I don't even understand all of the details in the posters life with due respect.
Relationships and marriage are work, no one said they were ever gonna be easy or a breeze. I don't mean to sound harsh. Maybe you still haven't found someone compatible just yet.. you know what they say though? That some of the best things come unexpectedly.. keeping looking if you want to or feel like it or not even then.
Until then"
5311,isfp,"I‚Äôve dated around, even been in a few years relationship it‚Äôs someone that I got along with. Never has it felt like I‚Äôm supposed to be with them. I just don‚Äôt see the chances of meeting someone who is compatible, attraction, values, etc. There‚Äôs way too much to consider and people and more than ever come and go. "
5312,isfp,"I've always considered myself an ISTP and then started wondering about INFP. Then someone suggested ISFP, which is something I'd never considered before. I read some descriptions of it that described it as an eccentric, social artist which didn't sound right. But a lot of details and the threads in this subreddit ring true in a way that the other MBTI subreddits never did.
For instance, I feel like I live life like a first person game. I observe a lot but don't really reflect on things. That isn't to say that I don't think or feel things, but I do it almost subconsciously. And in fact I do feel intensively, but it takes me a while to parse my emotions. And sometimes when I'm feeling something very strongly, my mind feels like it's looking at from a distance, like I'm playing a game.
Other aspects that ring true are my high competitive streak, the way I rarely initiate contact even with my loved ones, how I have a fairly good taste in fashion and enjoy looking good, and how I am a (somewhat) well-regarded fanfiction writer. I love doing things for other people, and while I don't like parading the fact, I get easily upset if people don't recognize and appreciate my efforts. I am also sensitive to criticism, though that is an aspect I am actively trying to mend.
Does this all sound like an isfp? I am conflicted because I hate socializing with people I'm not familiar with--in party settings. I hate small talk and the pressure of wanting these people to enjoy my company. However, I do love smaller intimate social settings with people I am familiar with.
A lot of isfp rings true for me and reading the threads in this subreddit has really put into words how I feel about my personality. What do you all think?"
5313,isfp,"Having a hard time falling asleep, only got about an hour of sleep and I have to wake up in 4 hours. This happens a lot the night before a big day. I have my intake today at the mental health clinic. Hopefully all goes well. 
Just going to listen to my playlist since falling asleep is impossible at this point. Here it is just in case you wanted to listen.

5314,isfp,"Sorry, I've only just seen this. Thanks for sharing. I really relate.
I think you can train yourself to stop giving a shit, but in doing so a part of you dies.  
It's unfortunate how many compromises are made in order just to get through sometimes. I don't have an answer."

5316,isfp,"I believe I am an ISFP so here's my personal take on it..
Pros:
- non judgmental of people so you don't have the hate and judgmental attitude naturally that a lot of people possess.
- you are able to fully appreciate nature and animals at a very simple and unassuming way.
- usually artistic
- independent
- you try to follow your own path in life so you are a natural trendsetter. I think this quality is also good because sometimes the majority mindset is wrong.
Now to the cons...
- reallllyyy bad at thinking of the future and planning. This really messes me up financially(I'm really bad at saving money, I'm queen of the ""treat yo self!"" Mindset lol.)
-too sensitive. Now this can be seen as good but it's really hindered me in life because I take everything personally whenever I should use people's feedback to work on myself and see something from their perspective.
- timid
- really bad at putting my thoughts into words so people can underestimate me or get the wrong impression."
5317,isfp,"Life as an isfp is pretty great. People generally like us, we find happiness in the little things, and we can achieve great things if we find something we‚Äôre passionate about. We‚Äôre generally good at things, and are in touch with our emotions and the emotions of others.
But, we‚Äôre stuck in the paradox of being lonely and wanting to do everything alone. We can have trouble speaking our minds and opening up. We understand others better than most, in my opinion, but that makes everything really complicated. We can‚Äôt deal with conflict.
All in all, though, i wouldn‚Äôt trade it for any other type."
5318,isfp,"Well I'm speaking from my own personal experience so it doesn't mean it's true for everyone but what I meant about it for me was that I tend to assume the best of everyone and focus on everyone's good qualities. I am only judgemental of genuinely mean people. Other than that I don't hate people for being dumb,poor,unpopular,etc etc. Where as I notice a lot of the more common types such as ESFJ tend to make fun of the underdog or be judgemental of anyone who is different."
5319,isfp,"As the title says I can‚Äôt  really determine my type. I have gone through my functions stack and I‚Äôll give you examples.
I know I am an introvert. I am very laconic. I believe actions should speak louder than words. Words are powerful and they are even more powerful when seldom used. I am very witty but I try not to speak. I let other people do the talking. You can learn a lot about a person by being quiet and watch them insecurely speak a million words. You learn even more if their words contradict their actions. Eventually people drain me and if I am around people for too long I get very cynical. I hope for the best in people but I often see the worst.
I am sure I use Se. When I am not working it is in a lazy way. I am very laidback and want to have a good time. When I am working (Electrical mechanic), I am very dedicated, I believe in doing quality work to the best of my ability. If I didn‚Äôt do any less than my best that would feel an awful lot like stealing. But off work I can be a couch potato probably because I‚Äôm tired and enjoy the break. I like poetry, books, history, psychology and mythology. Things that help me explore emotional depths and understand human behavior and thinking. I also enjoy art, music, and cinema.
As for Fi or Ti. Honestly this is where I struggle. I have strong morals. I am a traditional, hard working male who sees the value in traditions and not in a blind faith sort of way but I can also back up the traditions I value strongly with logic. But I will oppose traditions that don‚Äôt make sense. I have torn apart every major religion and found the flaws in them. This rocked my world as I was raised Christian. I refuse to do things that go against my morals. I strongly believe in honor, family, and protecting the weak. 
I want to go ahead and say that I respect whatever you believe but for me this is my story and what I have found to be true. As I got older and studied the Bible, I found many inconsistencies. This lead to a kick where I broke down every book and chapter and found every contradiction. Everything that didn‚Äôt line up. I also did this with the other major abrahamic religions. I actually studied Hebrew on my own. I basically witnessed the biblical story evolve from polytheism, to a henotheistic cult, to a temple cult, to a monotheistic cult, to a dualistic cult, and then to a messianic cult and finally to a Paulianic cult. All roads lead back to polytheism and psychological archetypes. Again, if you‚Äôre Christian, I mean no offense. I respect what you believe, I just couldn‚Äôt believe anymore after delving back so far. My current beliefs revolve around forces of nature, archetypes and being a good person. I just never understood how a culturally Western European person could find solace in an Abrahamic eastern religion. It clashed with my views of honor, family, and justice. 
I don‚Äôt know if the drive to understanding different religions was via Fi or Ti. Being Christian always felt wrong to me. But using history, comparative mythology, and psychology I came to peace and found my current gods which feels right. I don‚Äôt know if that was me using Fi and Te or Ti and Fe.
As for Ni. I can use that for work. I am a great troubleshooter. I can look at a circuit and pretty much take it apart and figure out how it works and I can visualize how wires are run but when it comes to planning for the future, I suck. I am organized, a minimalist, but I wouldn‚Äôt call myself someone who needs routine. I prefer improvising. But I see the value in making lists and delegating tasks because part of my job is seeing the big picture on projects.
I may have inferior Te or Fe.
I am prone to explosive fits of rage if someone tries to test me or treads over my beliefs. I am also protective and hate bullies.
I also feel the need to over organize and clean when I am stressed out which I hear can be a Te thing.
I am leaning towards ISFP based on my strong values and desire to be who I am supposed to be and not fit a mold. I am very rebellious. I get competitive. I am an Enneagram 8.  On the exterior I appear cold and calculated until you get to know me. Hard shell and soft interior for those I love. I am very private and never tell anyone my struggles or hardships. Only reason I am being open here is it‚Äôs reddit which is anonymous."
5320,isfp,"I'm sure you use Se to a large extent, but I see more Ti than Fi in this post. High Ti and low Fe usually doesn't want to follow social convention and morals just for the sake of it. They do so when it makes logical sense to them. That's characteristic of Ti, it wants to trust in its own logic and rules, instead of anyone else's which makes them rebellious. It becomes a key part of their sense of self. Of course that is carried over to morals as well, if they are inclined to be a good person. The transition to Fe (warmth) is sign of a maturing ISTP. :)"
5321,isfp,"That makes a lot of sense. Actually as a child I always struggled with expressing emotions. Rage was easy. I went through the ringer early on in life and I think it forced me to develop and integrate most my functions really well. Fe though has been later, I‚Äôd say within the last year or so is when I began letting myself become closer to my friends and family. It‚Äôs weird always being a loner and yet this goofy group of people take you in and make you a space to belong.
Under extreme duress and anxiety I am prone to exploding in rage. I always feel this steady empty feeling. I actually draw, write, watch movies and listen to music just to feel. I also box and do mixed martial arts. Most my day I feel like I‚Äôm on auto pilot until I find something stimulating. Especially at work, like an electrical problem.
I think my reoccurring problems with inferior Fe is the dead give away of being an ISTP."
5322,isfp,"I really don't like when people put barriers around me and try to limit me, but I don't mind it that much since at least then I can just ignore it. However when people put barriers on others, it annoys me a lot and makes me want to help the people who are getting restricted. This annoys me a lot and ruins my day cause I put effort in helping others but it doesn't work out anyways.
I don't know what to do anymore."
5323,isfp,"My answer is dependent on what the type of barrier would be. Personally I can understand the ability to act nonchalantly to keep the peace and I think others will respect that aspect of you as well when they get to know you more. One thing ISFPs (myself included) usually need help with is is understanding the need for communicating your feelings in the moment instead of letting them bottle up and eventually exploding out at a critical moment of stress. By doing this you are taking the initiative to give the people erecting the barriers a chance to consider what they are doing to you and others emotionally. It's not easy due to our laid back nature, preference of action to dialogue, and inability at times to clearly convey our thoughts, but I think if you can work on these aspects it will help improve you and your friends situation and your quality of life. Hope this helps!"
5324,isfp,"You are thinking to much about it, I'm just like you when it comes to people trying to restrict me but I am willing to get into conflict to get my point across. I hate nothing more then when people try to control me and I will make that clear to those people.
I also always feel the need to help others but have come to realise that I can only be supporting hand from the outside. Change will only happen if the person wants it to happen. Sometimes you will find that there is nothing you can do even though you know it is wrong, and you have to accept that."
5325,isfp,No problem. It can be hard not to when you are conscious of how you would want to be treated and do not want to negatively impact anyone (even if you feel they are negatively impacting you). There are certain people who need to hear what you are feeling though because they are not equipped to easily understand feelings or displays of emotional behavior. Hopefully things in your circle will start getting better.
5326,isfp,"Oh that's interesting! I suppose not keeping things too strict can be helpful in keeping up the habit. I think that's called ""flexitarian""? Can I ask if you do this for health, ethical, environmental, etc?"
5327,isfp,"Mostly ethical and environmental reasons. 
The main reason why I go for the ""flexitarian"" thing instead of full on vegetarian or vegan is probably not a very good one but it's mostly because when I visit my parents (the rare times that I do) they make dinner with meat. I'm just concerned that if I was to ask them to make me something without meat that it would be a big hassle for them (they're old and them making simple dinners is quite the challenge) and I don't want to do that to them. "
5328,isfp,"it's for ethical, environmental and health reasons :)
i've considered attempting veganism, and i usually try to make one day a week vegan, but i think making the plunge completely would be really challenging"
5329,isfp,"I was already a vegetarian for 9 years and that was cuz I saw some videos as well, this year I switched to veganism cuz I realized vegetarianism still contributes to animal suffering! I guess I had never realized it before or chose to ignore it.
But aw man Earthlings terrifies me, I am afraid to watch it and since I'm already vegan I see no reason to (except to try and get my boyfriend to watch it)
Was it really hard for you to watch?"
5330,isfp,"Well I'm glad you're such an open-minded individual! 
It can definitely be challenging at times (like especially now around thanksgiving) but totally worth the effort. I know how daunting it can be cuz I was a vegetarian for so long, but the more you research and learn about the industry, the harder it is to put off making the switch. 
Hopefully one day you'll join the dark side;)"
5331,isfp,"Awesome! Nice one :) I think we've been so conditioned by society, the media etc to think it's normal that most people (myself included) don't even really think about it. Good for you that you were veggie for 9 years before that too :)
And yeah I don't really think you have any reason at all to watch it, but your boyfriend should! :D
I reasoned with myself after about 30 minutes of Earthlings to go vegan just so I could stop watching it x_x "
5332,isfp,"With my go-with-the-flow personality, I find that I seem to rewrite my entire brain to reflect whoever I spend the most time with.  This has happened in friendships and romantic relationships. It's such a gradual process that I don't see it until afterwards, like after a breakup or after I move on to a new group of friends. 
I used to think of it as my own personal growth and evolution, but I recently was told very harshly that I have no mine of my own and it's scary how easily influenced I am. Since then I've caught myself doing it and it really bothers me.
Do you ever feel like you are such a laid-back pushover that you lose yourself, and you have trouble remaining true to a self that you bury without thinking? 
Since it was pointed out to me, I've gotten way better at identifying what feels like ""me"" and what feels fake... but I want to become stronger so that I can stop getting into harmful relationships where I let myself be so thoroughly controlled that I become a completely different person."
5333,isfp,"This is also very much like me. However, I know that I'm doing it and came to realize that a lot of times it is actually very useful to do. The trick is to be aware of it and keep your own filter on. It can be quite hard but it is also a way to learn from others and copy the things you admire in them, or to try out new characteristics and see how they fit you.
I'm just realizing this as I am typing but I don't think this ""not having a mind of our own"" has much to do with not having an own opinion. What if it just seems like that because of a well developed empathic ability that makes it easy to see things from the other's perspective?
Great topic, curious what you all think."
5334,isfp,"As mentioned, I believe it is a result of being very empathetic. It's a unique ability. For me, the key is to surround myself with good people, especially people who understand the trait and don't take advantage or condemn.
After frustration about trying to figure out who I was, I embraced this quality. I'm still working on ""defining"" myself, and as you understand, it's ever changing. Writing my thoughts down helps me develop my opinions, but I don't have the discipline to write as often as I'd like. 
Music is very personal to me. I jotted down favorites and used those to discover more alike, developing this area the most. It gave me a sense of ground. I suppose this approach could be useful across the board. 
On a side note, because of this trait I love reading non-fiction! It puts me in another world."
5335,isfp,"Yeah, I relate to this. I think it may be to do with enneagram 9, which is a common enneagram for ISFP. 
I feel like I don't relate to some descriptions of Fi dom because I don't really have very strong opinions or convictions all the time, and my personality easily changes depending on who I'm with.
Sometimes I'll find that I become a foil to sort of ""balance"" the energy. Like if I'm with very emotional people I'll become more cold and logical, with very logical people I'll be more emotional. If I'm with loud people I'll be quiet,  with quiet people I'm more talkative. But then also sometimes I will just start to act and talk like whoever I'm with, automatically agreeing with them. I always notice and it annoys me because it feels fake.
I feel like I have a strong sense of self at some times and at other times I don't. I do naturally pay attention to how I feel before others, so I think doing that, reflecting and evaluating to figure out what I really think, what matters to me, and then just trying to be myself helps me to gain a better understanding and confidence in who I am, apart from others."
5336,isfp,Absolutely feel this way. Sometimes I get frustrated because it feels like there's so many aspects of myself that contradict eachother I often find myself wondering who I am. I think it also has to do with the fact that we are very understanding and frequently place ourselves in the other person's shoes so we're able to relate. I personally make an effort to say okay I understand this person's perspective now how does that match up with my own beliefs.
5337,isfp,"Wow, reading this is incredible. My mother and I have a lot of tension, I finally lost it and told her she has no sense of self. She took the mbti test and she's an ISFP. Knowing this is common for the type helps, and understanding that it comes from empathy makes so much sense in context now. I owe her an apology. "
5338,isfp,"I relate to what you said about music. I used to feel very boring and part of that was that I felt like I didn't have really distinct preferences in music or anything else. Finding out what I like to listen to, read, watch, do for fun, etc has helped me feel like I have a more...developed identity"
5339,isfp,"Yeah exactly, I'm always so able and willing to understand / relate to people, but then I never draw the line so I just get taken over. It's weird that I need to tell myself to be more critical/judgmental since it's commonly seen as a bad thing, but I'm kind of an extreme of always trying to accept every thing about everything, to the point where I don't know what I think or believe about anything anymore :/ like I've absorbed every perspective and can't filter through them."
5340,isfp,"Yes I agree!! When I'm alone listening to my music is one of the only times I feel authentically myself and I feel happy to be me. It's a great feeling that I don't get any other way!  I turn up my music sooo loud in the car and song along. It's when I feel the most ""dynamic""and exciting and bold! "
5341,isfp,"Very true. I think what helps for our type is identifying our morals and seeing if what we've absorbed is true to them. And maybe also taking what others say loosely. We don't always have to apply what others say to ourselves but rather see it as a representation of that person. I think setting boundaries is important as well, bc as an easy going type we often don't. "
5342,isfp,"Man, I had the hardest time trying to phrase that title for some reason.
What I am asking is, what did you guys want to do in your life (career wise) and how did it end up? Did you quit and change career focus? Did you end up with what you're wanting to do? Any knowledge to pass on to others?"
5343,isfp,"I majored in journalism because I love to write. I didn't necessarily want to write for newspapers, which is what journalism trains you for. Somehow, I found myself writing for travel magazines, which is what I wanted to do! Internships really helped me to figure out what I wanted."
5344,isfp,"I must say that this is an amazing post, since i always think ISFPs are not ideal for this society, where contemplating and beeing modest and calm are almost ""bad traits"".
Plus, i'm rly happy to see so many good answers and successful ISFPs
We did it, we have a relevant post!"
5345,isfp,"I finished the multimedia design career and after some time of doing websites, logos and stuff i realized i rly disliked it, i thought it as ""art"" but there was no expression there.
I ended up working as a full time programmer since i learned basic programming stuff while working on websites, now i'm studying about this while i work on it.
English is not my first language and im drunkish, dont be mean with writting"
5346,isfp,"I studied business,  then narrowed it down to finance.  Then tried out computer programming because I enjoy messing around with computer languages for projects every once in a while. But my computer homework was too hard for me,  probably because I was too busy zoning out in class and being up all night hanging out with my favorite crazy people. So I switched back to the finance track,  then eventually took a perpetual break because I don't even want a ""career"" to work hard at my whole life. I used my finance knowledge to figure out an easy money investment strategy for my bf and I to support ourselves in old age. Basically I gleaned some useful knowledge from college but F having a career. My bf and I both work for ourselves for cash right now,  constantly struggling with our work ethics and spending/savings ratios. So I guess to answer your question is I'd say use college to feed into your own knowledge to use as a tool for your benefit,  but don't just shell out for it because society tells you you should."
5347,isfp,"Journalism. Dropped out. Messed around with some other things for a few years. Going back to try again.
I think the most important thing you can do, regardless of what you study, is to get involved in things outside of class. If you're going into business, join a fraternity or sorority. Those types tend to flock there and they do a lot for the student body. If you're doing journalism, join the student paper or radio station. Just invest yourself in some way, shape or form outside of class. "
5348,isfp,"Studied Business/Marketing. Out of school, have had various roles in financial services and market research. Started in real estate, went to investment banking. Jumped ship and I now am in higher education. I much prefer the public sector, feels like I do my part to help the people. 
Overall I would say that I've kept true to my original calling, although my understanding of what marketing is has changed. "
5349,isfp,"I majored in Computer Science and just started working as a Software Developer. I keep reading that ISFPs hate the idea of a desk job, but I actually love the creative possibilities of programming, making some amazing things with just a few lines of code. "
5350,isfp,"Went to University and started out majoring in graphic design because I thought it would be like art . . . only you get paid. Ended up really disliking it - I felt like a sellout compromising my creative freedom for commercial purposes, and had a hard time handling the near-constant criticism. It was also really challenging to create quality work I was proud of with such tight deadlines and fast turnaround expected. I was always stressed. 
Switched majors and now I'm teaching elementary school. It's a great fit for me! I love my class and I can be creative here in so many different ways! It's always fun introducing the kids to new info; I dress up in crazy outfits that coincide with what we are learning about like Ms. Frizzle. It's also fun figuring out how to explain information to each kid in a way that makes sense to them specifically - all their minds are so unique (mbti comes in super handy here). I could list a bunch more things I love about it but I'll restrain myself. 
TL;dr Disliked competitive commercialized artistic job, much happier working with little kids.  "
5351,isfp,"I grew up in the USA and majored in Italian language because I thought it would be cool to live in Italy as a tour guide or as an Italian or English teacher. I did end up traveling and studying in Italy as a result but decided to live in the USA. I worked for a publishing company that allowed me to actually use my Italian skills as well as Spanish (my other language) with clients that lived abroad. I used the skills on a daily basis but the work itself was very much a cubicle job with a lot of boring excel work and occasional desktop publishing. 
I left the corporate world in 2009 to move  to South Korea to teach kids English. I have worked with young learners until just last year when I became a teacher trainer. I loved my job working with kids because each day was new and I was working in an English camp setting where we had a constant rotation of new students. I loved being creative, living in the moment and sharing my passion of learning with the kids.
Since last year I have had to be a teacher trainer where I am expected to show other people how to do my job, I am supposed to teach a course repeatedly and expected to create boring things such as books and detailed lesson plans on a regular basis. Needless to say I am miserable and am longing for the days when I was in the classroom and feeding off the energy of curious kids instead of being stuck in a room with adults who are literally fighting to stay awake. 
I am glad I found this little subreddit because I see am I not alone!"
5352,isfp,"From what I understand, when people say a desk job they mean something simplistic like filing papers or cataloging statistics or something. Computer programming is, in many ways, a creative outlet.  I think that's different."
5353,isfp,"Hate the idea of urban nature... actually just hate the idea of urban... would rather nature on its own without shitty buildings, and cars polluting everything, and people focused on work with their tunnel visions. "
5354,isfp,"Not until I was about 19. I used to go for a 2-3 hour walk, through the town, along the beach, etc. passed many people during the day, without really registering them, or anything else. Couldn't tell you if I'd passed an attractive woman, a well-dressed man; if a car had honked its horn, if a bird had sang.   
Then, everything flipped. I'm absorbing all of my environment constantly. When it rains, I can feel the ground all around me."
5355,isfp,"Absolutely! I honestly don't get truly bored super often because I can just become super absorbed in my surroundings. I think the most stereotypical thing I have ever done was when I was playing a piece of music on the piano for my friend, before looking up and out the window, seeing a rabbit, and immediately leaving my piano to go outside and fine the bunny lol. I honestly have a really difficult time focusing often because I'm constantly just in my own little world (not like I constantly daydream or anything, but I'll just be focusing on small details like birds singing or the colors in flowers and the little minuscule details in tree bark, etc. if that makes any sense?)"
5356,isfp,"Sometimes pensive. Sometimes a kind of trance. Either way, little-to-no external stimuli was going into the working memory.  
I was a very paranoid/anxious teenager. Lots of dissociation / depersonalisation. It wasn't until my early twenties that I realised not everyone experienced the world in such a way.
Sorry, I don't know. Perhaps just a kind of maturation.
Sometimes I wish I could go back. I'm so easily distracted now. Although I often daydream when I haven't got an activity to focus on.  
(Sorry, this must be dull to read. I wish I had a more exciting answer)."
5357,isfp,"Wes Anderson's been mentioned. He's an ISFP. Try Rushmore and Moonrise Kingdom.
Also try The Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives. Brick, too. Welcome to the Dollhouse. Kids.
I like Manhunter, even if the actor who portrays Will Graham can't really act. Blade Runner.
You'd probably have good luck with Studio Ghibili films. I like Porco Rosso and Whisper of the Heart.
I have yet to watch Boyhood, but that's supposed to be a good one."
5358,isfp,"Excellent question! Perhaps Edward Norton's character in Fight Club? Quiet, reserved guy, very much a pacifist before his transformation. I don't know how truly accurate that one is, but I guess it kind of fits."
5359,isfp,"boyhood was good, just make sure you have like 3 hrs to watch all the movie. I didn't think it was that long and ended up staying up really late/early watching it. I heavily enjoyed it and didn't even fall asleep"
5360,isfp,"Wow. I was OBSESSED with that as a child. My sister is fond of regaling me with the stories of the many times I would kick and scream for 'POWDAHHH' to be put on. Never heard any even mention it outside of that, how interesting. "
5361,isfp,"What a nice thing to say! 
I wonder what inspires people like yourself to be so randomly kind? I‚Äôm genuinely curious because this kind of thing literally never crosses my mind? I‚Äôm wondering how it works? 
Lol, curious ENTJ moment. üòÖ"
5362,isfp,"It provides me no value unfortunately. Perhaps even negative value as i have to look at such a hollow statement to try and build myself up and hope it works.
It probably works for some people. Not me unfortunately."
5363,isfp,"Hi!
I asked for help with this topic among my other INFPs and didn‚Äôt get a lot of response. Any input, advice, or experience regarding this thread would be really helpful!
I‚Äôm a female INFP with a mild crush on an ISFP male. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not interesting enough for him to talk to, because everytime I‚Äôm around him I get instantly shy. I have no trouble extroverting and being friendly with people in our circle of friends but I just don‚Äôt know what to say to him to get him talking. He‚Äôs an incredibly talented musician and totally eccentric as a person, which I find endearing rather than off-putting. However as I can only make minimal conversation he just, well kinda stands there and listens and waits for me to talk, and I just awkwardly stumble over myself, even thougg we are both humorous and extremely intelligent people. 
I think he‚Äôs interested; he does walk up to me and be friendly and such, but I‚Äôm not for sure. His best friend is an ISFJ and thinks we‚Äôd get on delightfully well and that it would be a good match. But since we both share the feeling preference, most Likely....INFPS tend to be like ‚ÄúNo, you cant date them, it would be too emotional/chaotic/a hassle and you‚Äôre always taking care of them bc they‚Äôre like inept children‚Äù. 
I really need to hear things from your guys‚Äô end bc the Infps are being a bit...depressing and whiny honestly. 
Sorry for the long post. I think it would work because Im a little more on the logical side of the INFP spectrum.  Help!"
5364,isfp,"Well before you take anything I have to say seriously I've never been in a romantic relationship, the extent of my knowledge here is how I behave around my crush, who is probably INFP.
I know oftentimes I will just listen to people talk because I find what they have to say interesting honestly. The causes vary though, around my crush... well I don't talk to her much because I am afraid I'll look stupid, lol. 
If you have an interest in music, I would suggest striking up a conversation about music if you want to get him talking more. If he's like me, then a mention of his interests is enough to get him talking enough that he may have to remember to let you get a word in edgewise! XD
I wouldn't take the people on the INFP forum talking about how INFP and ISFP is a bad match seriously. The extent of the usefulness for typology is categorising for comparing and explaining actions. My parents are INFX and ESTX, supposedly one of the worst combinations aside from ISFJ and ENTP, and they've been married for almost 20 years. 
Also, I'm not an inept child!... I'm a procrastinating child. :P"
5365,isfp,"i have been with my ldr girlfriend for over a year now Shes an INFP and im ISFP ,there are lots of emotions , if you both are mature enough there will be no need for either of you to take care of the other as we are Inept children, know that we're extremely laid back , so taking decisions might be a hassle , there has not been any conflicts between us till now , on the emotional side we both oooze love and affections and its pretty lovely ."
5366,isfp,"Oh I don‚Äôt know you but I deeply love you already for your good advice. Hang in there buddy! Keep the faith that eventually things will work out for you and your crush. I‚Äôm sure she will be totally flattered you like her ‚ù§Ô∏è :)
Infps are also great procrastinators too! I will definitely try to engage talking to him about his music and how he comes up with ideas for it. I appreciate the boost of support, and I‚Äôm not worried if he does all the talking‚Äîit will help me to understand him and find things to talk to him about. 
Good luck ThreeBlackSevens ;)"
5367,isfp,"This is my motto. I have been living by this statement for just over ten years now. It means a lot to me. People ask me often what it means. This is my first time writing about it, so bear with me while I try to order my thoughts in a way that makes sense.
It means exactly what it says. Figure it out. Doing so, however, isn't always easy. Going through a rough time and crying on someones shoulder can be figuring it out. Buckling down and suffering to get it done can be figuring it out. Moving on can be figuring it out. Whatever it takes to get from your point (Point A) to the desired location (Lets say Point B) is figuring it out. Figuring it out also doesn't have anything to do with succeeding. Its all about not giving up. The it in figure IT out isn't the thing. It is you.
No one else is going to figure it out for you. You can have help, but ultimately you have to figure it out. Whatever it takes to keep you moving is figuring it out. No matter the situation, and no matter the outcome. You have to do whatever it takes to keep moving. If you can't accept it. Change it. If you can't change it. Find a way to live without it. If you can't live without it. Find a way to live with it. Figure it out.
Stop moving for a while and think. If thats what you need to do. Then do it. You don't have to exist on a graph where your movement on said graph is constant. Your movement doesn't have to follow a pattern. You can move faster some years and slower some years. You can regress too. That is totally fine. As long as you don't give up. The moment you give up. I feel sorry for you. Giving up on yourself is the worst thing you can do. You matter. Don't you fucking dare let yourself believe you don't. Figure it out.

A few quotes that I really like on the subject.

Thoughts?"
5368,isfp,"I like your motto. It‚Äôs similar to mine which is ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be fine‚Äù. In a way it‚Äôs like telling myself that I‚Äôll figure it out and pull on through. I haven‚Äôt had a situation where I didn‚Äôt end up fine. I‚Äôve had many situations where I was not fine for a while but eventually I was fine. 
My other mottos include:
Fun is what you bring with you 
Trust no ho 
There are things to be learned from this. "
5369,isfp,Im considering getting figure it out as a tattoo. I know that its gonna look super douchey though. And when I explain it its gonna sound equally as douchey. Its the main reason I haven't gotten it yet.

I prefer INTJ since they think and make a decision. My best friend is INTJ and said I have no intuition, too emotional, and too extrovert. He said I might be ESFP or ESFJ. What do you think?
So here are a few things about me:

I am not logical at all.
I have no intution.
I react emotionally.
I take things personally.
I lack tact.
I dont understand emotions yet my reactions are emotional.
I want others to get to the point as I cant process whatever they say.
I am not big of details. Even at work either I cannot grasp the details or they dont interest me.
I cannot process playing games even at work to dating. I dont understand them.
I react vs think.
I like socializing but pick on peoples vibe at times for example if they are they type of person who are passive aggressive I just avoid them or play dumb.
I love fashion.
I am too emotional.
I am too open book where strangers have told me dont be too open.
I make friends easily but my emotions sabotage them.
I take jokes very personally.
I lash out when someone makes fun of me.
I do not get people being sarcastic or bantering. I take it personally.
I want to be myself and at work it is hard since everyone has an angle at corporate america.
I am an Aries.
I get my feelings hurt very very easily.
I take everything very personally.
My family says I am annoying while to me Im just messing with them since they are so quiet.
I prefer women that are logical and details so I dont have to worry about details.
I cannot have facebook, twitter, or social media since I am too open and too emotional.
I like socializing but with everyone playing an angle I just keep to myself. This is where my emotions kick in and I start thinking everyone is planning against me.
I cannot stand the heat or beach. I prefer air conditioned.

‚Äã
‚Äã
I used to get ISTJ. My INFP childhood friend said I am ISTJ, like good will hunting matt damon. Problem is I hate details. I want someone else to have responsibility of following rules. I thought I was an INTJ. My INTJ best friend is very patient and his mind is like 50 cent. I react emotionally to things and take things very very personally.
I can not be with estp for too long, bc if they like you, they bust ur balls. When that happens, I take it as a personal threat. Most times I dont get the joke.
Even in dating, women at times will start busting balls, when they like the guy. They begin to notice I am taking it personally. I just walk away. To me, if I am not busting ur balls than why are you busting my balls.
ISFP are creative and I dont have a creative bone in my body. So Im thinking ESFP since ESFJ have tact."
5371,isfp,"When you say that you don't have a creative bone in your body, do you mean that you don't create artworks? Because that's something commonly associated with ISFPs but to me the key point seems to be that ISFPs tend to like/excel in imagining new ways of doing things. It can be a newer, better way of cleaning your room even.
‚Äã
Two relevant characteristics I notice in my IxTJ friends are: 1. Constant awareness of logical flow during conversations. 2. They like to be in control of their emotional expressions and so, try their best to do so even if they are hurt. ...You don't seem to display these characteristics as strongly as they do.
‚Äã
I didn't read through your entire post but perhaps you wanna read more about functions. Especially inferior functions. You largely seem to display inferior Te which IxFPs have... but I will leave it up to you to verify."
5372,isfp,"I would definitely say you're ""T"" over ""F"", and appear more ""P"" than ""J"". xxTP. What have the various online tests typed you as? 
The type traits are more of a guideline that varies between individuals even of the same type. xNTx types for me can be oil and water with certain individuals but other xNTx ones we get along well. Depends on the person sometimes."
5373,isfp,"Yep, this sounds like ISFP. Ik that some ppl may say some of those qualities are Fe but ISFPs yearn to express their deep feelings externally through pretty much any tangible medium. 
Our intuition is hazy, abstract but it‚Äôs there. We don‚Äôt use it as much as INFJ/INTJ but ironically the first function tends to sabotage any of the types, heard this from davesuperpowers. In other words, we use it so much that it can be incorrect at times. They tend to think they‚Äôre always right about their intuitive thoughts but aren‚Äôt always. 
I still admire them and they have more depth within their thoughts but it isn‚Äôt fair of them to say you aren‚Äôt intuitive."
5374,isfp,"Only creative thing I do is daydream or living in my head. Like new movies I can create or new way of doing things. My dreams change instantly. 
I have no control over my emotions like ISTJ coworker does. He thinks first and than speaks. Sometimes he just pisses me off. He is slow to act. My thing is act and regret later. I said too much to him as far as politics at work and he has distanced himself from me. He looks at all angles before he talks. My emotions get the best of me. 
Problem is I dont understand emotions. Also I dont like to get involved in dating unless I know it is for sure since my emotions will go off if I think she is too slow, wasting my time, too boring, too safe. 
My sister is INFP so she says I am very disrespectful.  My INFP sister given her anxiety/depression you cannot tell what is going on. When I had depression, everyone knew because I was very vocal. 
My ESTJ brother and ENFJ sister are surprised I lasted this long in corporate america.
My ISFJ past coworker said I cannot work others cause my feelings get hurt easily and I tell them to F off in their face. 
ISTJ past coworker thinks I have problem with authority. 
ESTJ I cannot stand since they always want to put me in a box. If I dont fit in a box, ESTJ get nervous bc they like structure. Hence they start bullying.
My dad is ISTP and my mom is ENFJ. My dad always like joking vs thinking about his future or hygiene and I cannot stand him. My mom is very manipulative. Her sincere empathetic voice tone fools everyone but me. Both parents are super hard workers. My dad just never looks outside the box. My mom says I am too sour cause I am always angry. I just dont like ENFJ drama. Otherwise my few selected friends find me crazy, hilarious, and very draining.
I hate manual labor. I have gotten fired from supermarket stores since they just see me as lazy. Putting things in order, cleaning, customer service I will be good for the first few days. After that I just dont like to do it. Construction jobs to anything requiring physical is just not for me. I rather just sit. I also dont like 9 to 5 bc it gets boring. Current job is Corporate. As much as I hate drama, it keeps me on my toes. Problem is I just dont understand the game and how to play it. I am learning slowly but find it exhausting"
5375,isfp,"ISFP are competitive and I am not. Also I like doing things on my terms but my terms get lazy. 
Problem is I do not understand emotions and cannot deal with other emotions bc I do not know how to deal with mine. I just shut down after a while.
For some reason Im starting to believe my mind/thinking side is not existent since INTJ, ESTJ, ISTJ come up with so many techniques while I am reacting emotionally vs challenging them mentally"
5376,isfp,"Well when a situation comes up, I get emotional happy or emotional outburst. When things get too much , my emotions are all over the place and I am not skilled to handle them so I suppress them. When things are getting out of hand and need order, I shove into ET. When I dont like things, I go hard on Extroverted Thinking to get things done. 
Usually I prefer to daydream and prefer things to be fun. 
If someone says something to me, my emotions react right away.
I dont think nor filter. I just say it.
If I dont like someone and I am not at work I am very short with them or ignore that area.
Problem is I dont have T to think of a plan and make a move. At work its alot of politics which I do not grasp and too naive to see through. Its an Extroverted Thinking workplace. 
I get my feelings hurt very easily.
I cannot do details. Digging deep into things gets me lost, bored, drained, so I use extroverted thinking. 
I might show laziness but I am just not interested in doing those things. 
I have fake small talk. Once in a while if I dont have to see you on a daily basis I dont mind. If you are next to me, everyday at work, small talk, I just want to curse you out."
5377,isfp,"Now, recently she brought up the idea of coming over to my place to have a movie night. I was cool with it and randomly a few days ago text me and says she wants to have the movie night. So I agree and we meet at my house after work, then get booze. We get back to my place and have a long nice conversation and then go to my room to watch the movie we pick. We then both down the whole bottle of booze  in under two hours (I was blackout drunk). After the movie I'm pretty sure I rolled over to her on the bed and kissed her (like maybe for 5-10 seconds a few pecks I don't think tongue). As soon as I realize I'm kissing her and jump up off the bed and say I'm sorry and lead her to another room to sleep.
She goes to the other room and takes the covers with her. Not long after laying on my bed coverless (for a few minutes/two hours who knows) I go get her and tell her to come back to the bed with me. We get back in bed together and while keeping space between us (hammered but remorseful and half sleep) I kept telling her that I was sorry. She then responds by just saying my name (meaning she wants me to shut up) and says ""what are you sorry for?"".
When we wake up I notice that she is in my hoodie and just some panties rolled over on me trying to tangle my legs and play footsie with me (at least that what it seemed like). Later we both wake up and do some talking for about an hour (not mentioning anything of the last night) and hugs me good bye and drives home (with my hoodie).
Now we've been texting like normal for the last few days, but I think she has been avoiding seeing me so I can being back some stuff she left at my house (avoidance is a way she has dealt with stuff between us before). Also, I was suppose to accompany her to her first counseling appointment today. She actually wants me to just leave her stuff in my car during work so she can pick it up.
She's the best friend I've had in a very long time and I don't want to lose it. I'm sure she doesn't either.
We tell each other we love each other all the time and we've both talked about how much we mean to each other all the time.
I'm aware of the consequences that can happen from this (loss of friendship, respect, avoidance, friendship worsening) . I just don't know how it'll go and I don't know what she could possibly be thinking. I'm prepared for anything and am not really worried about myself or my feelings as I have the tools to work through it. I'm more concerned with her feelings and how I could have affected her. She has had guy friends who try and get with her and I'm afraid that she thought she found someone different, but still got her trust betrayed. We give each other space all the time and are never in each other's business 24/7 so I don't mind that. I'm not in love with her or anything, so I'm not emotional over possibly being ""rejected"" just afraid that she thinks I might be in love with her. And really concerned with losing my best friend.
On one end I think I've messed up and believe that she might possibly have lost respect for me (she thinks I have it all together and I'm somewhat of a mentor to her at this point). On the other end I think maybe she's just weirded out and just needs time to sort out things? Heck, maybe she doesn't remember? Maybe there's some things I did that I didn't remember? I don't know?
How would some of you react in this situation? What do think she's thinking given the info?"
5378,isfp,"If she is your best friend, I think you should gather the courage to have an honest conversation with her. It sounds to me like she may be interested in you but is now avoiding you because your actions align with rejection."
5379,isfp,"Yes, we're good. We've hung out like twice a week from like the end of August-September. And she' asked me to hang out more but I've been at work a lot recently. 
Didn't have any talk though. I tried to bring it up by asking ""what happened once we got really drunk"". But she just responded by saying we fell asleep. So I decided to not pry any further after that. "
5380,isfp,"I was blacked out. We took shots while watching the movie and all I was think I remember is that we were talking and we looked at each other and I either inched close to her and we kissed or I more-or-less jump her bones and I mostly kissed her. So I don't know if she did or not. I feel like once I got close she did kiss back and I'm pretty confident it wasn't any tongue involved. It felt like a dream actually. Then I snapped out of that state and yes, I guess I didn't want to go further (if that was the case). Not like that, if in fact it was progressing. 
That's part of the reason I can't wait until we ultimately discuss it. I'm like a mentor to her too, to the point she talks about me if she interviews for a job sometimes. I feel like that could be one reason she could be freaked out. Sometimes I think she thinks I'm damn near perfect. Like she projects that on me.
Another reason I hope we talk about it is because I want to let her know that was not something I've been planning to do. She has a mix of depression, anxiety and possibly some type of trauma (like ptsd, but that's another story).
I'm just worried about her. Like I wouldn't be heartbroken if she was never my best friend again, I just want her to be okay and on the road to recovery. And I'm afraid I've may have disrupted that. I've had similar mental issues as her around her age, so if this all falls a part I can take it. But I don't know if she can, IF she feels I overstepped a boundary.
Sorry for the tangent.."
5381,isfp,"Yeah she is my best friend. It's starting to be by far. I love her to death, and we have a lot of similarities in values and taste in some other things; and obviously we're similar in our decision making. So there is a lot there. 
Full disclosure: I'd be lying if I said I didn't-at least intellectually-thought about us going on a formal date.
And yeah we do need to have a conversation."
5382,isfp,"It's hard to determine how she feels because you memory of events is unreliable as you were drunk. Because of this, it would behoove you to start preparing for the worst possible outcome. When you do talk to her, it'd be best if you ask direct questions about how she feels. Beating around the bush will usually get you no where when dealing with isfp's. Don't forget to manage your own mental health. Instead of stressing about the situation, accept everything that has happened and all the possible outcomes. Losing friends sucks but life is a bitch and we all fuck up sometimes. "
5383,isfp,"Yeah I here ya.
I don't think I'll lose her as a friend. I just don't want it change or to look at me like I planned to get black out drunk and make a move. 
We saw each other today briefly. But it wasn't a good time to bring it up (she met me in the parking lot at work). She was smiling and joking and stuff.
I'm starting to think that maybe she doesn't even remember much of it, if at all.."
5384,isfp,"Lewis Hamilton is a Formula 1 Driver who's never involved with drama and is a very nice guy for someone who competes at a high level in automotive racing.
A few people I spoke with once though him to be ISTP, but not even close. ISTPs don't come off this friendly even if they wanted to.
Here's a clip of him:
http://www.cc.com/video-clips/e8x643/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-lewis-hamilton---breaking-the-mold-in-formula-one-racing---extended-interview
Thanks."
5385,isfp,"This was a cool video, I'd never watched him before, what a nice chap! He definitely seemed to have the ISFP traits based on this ineterview. The only moment I hesitated the ISFP verdict is when he said he was micromanaging the fashion show. But  wanting to control such an expressive and creative event is actually quite ISFP, to exactly get his taste and art across the way he wants it."
5386,isfp,"according to my last job's boss I was like that. everyone had some drama with another worker except for myself, I just was too focused on working and worried about making a mistake I guess. the truth is that I did dislike a few of my coworkers, but I was always nice to them because they were generally nice to me. I was talking to an old coworker last week and he said the same as my boss, that I was the only person who didn't have issues with anyone. 
I don't know if that guy is ISFP(but I'm also bad at typing people), but I like his sweater. Really cool that he has a fashion design thing going, that's something I'd like to do as well in the future. He also seems like a genuinely nice person"
5387,isfp,"I like his demeanour and his energy, so calm and earthy. Definitely an ISFP, he talks a lot about what he values rather than the technical side of driving. I know an ISTP with an advanced Fe can do that, but it seems to come naturally to him. Seems like a healthy ISFP at that, I'd like to be more like him as I develop myself."
5388,isfp,"Yeah, I've come across many (3) ISTPs to know that they're not very expressive. They look like their eyebrows are on fire when they talk, and their eyes are fucking intense lmao.
INTPs, on the other hand, for some reason, are very capable of expressing a wide range of emotions when I hang out with them (4).
But if you want ISTP, watch Kimi Raikkonen. For the ones I've come across, they'll give you a caustic response if you say or ask something obvious."
5389,isfp,"Sometimes it's a strength (when we are focused on a passion, and put other things aside to do it) but other times it doesn't help me, when I feel very slow.
Do you find there is a balance between reminding yourself that some tasks are better done quickly and rejecting an externally-imposed fast pace?"
5390,isfp,"I feel you 100%. I've gotten criticism all my life for doing things in my own time. I can't explain it other than ""eventually it'll be accomplished"" procrastination mentality. It's a little more focused when it's a passion project, but that's more about my creative methodology. As for the day to day minutiae, I set a vibrating timer on my watch for ten minutes dedicated solely to one activity, move on to a logical next task that I dedicate another ten minutes to and so forth five times, then take a ten minute ""me time"" break. I then start the rotation until tasks are done. It's a minimalist way for me to be type A for a bit. I just hate constant deadlines, and this works for me to chunk the bs into manageable amounts. My idea is we only have one life to live, the rushing nonsense is nonsense. "
5391,isfp,"Is there another type that you know you're not but you wish you were? Some websites show isfp to be the ""worst"" type (I know there's no worst type but read similarminds.com has to say about us). Do you mind having a biased negative connotation to us or are you indifferent to how others think of you?"
5392,isfp,"Personally, i love being an ISFP. I‚Äôm artistic and creative and i love our type! i can‚Äôt really imagine myself as any other. I do think sometimes we‚Äôre all way too hard on ourselves, and criticism can be very personal - but i don‚Äôt wish i was any other type. Maybe sometimes i wish i was slightly more extroverted, but that‚Äôs about as far as it goes. 
I‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôve come across the particularly negative traits that make us sound really bad, although i‚Äôve read a few ‚Äòdisadvantages‚Äô but don‚Äôt all websites claim that each type has these? 
I‚Äôve met a few people who wished they were ISFP‚Äôs and a few people that have rolled their eyes, but we got to remember it‚Äôs just one personality test after all. :) "
5393,isfp,I am an INFP and I had a phase where I wished I were an ISFP. I had too many thoughts in my head and wanted to be down-to-earth and chill like ISFPs. I learned to use meditation to my benefit and now I'm okay. I guess everyone wishes they were another type at one point or the other.
5394,isfp,"If I could switch to an ENTJ for a few days that would probably really benefit me lol. Overall, I'm happy being ISFP and I feel like a lot of us know how to accept ourselves for who we are (coming from a type 4 btw)"
5395,isfp,i still sometimes wish i can be esfp just bc in my dreams i would be completely outgoing and never get tired of being with people. even then i know i could never be an esfp so it doesn't bother me much at all. i've come across negative comments about isfp for being too private and hard to open up but i love the fact that im reserved and it takes work to get to know me. i personally love being an isfp and i get defensive reading negative comments about us 
5396,isfp,"I once wished i was Esfj, Infj, Infp, Isfj. Yeah aware that there might be some negativity towards isfps on certain sites and i actually mind it. Think the descriptions of isfps online dont do us a favour. Anyway sometimes i dont like being isfp but at other times i do. But i certainly would prefer isfps to stand out though. "
5397,isfp,"Kind of a strange question since it boils down to how much you appreciates yourself and how much you identify with a certain type, in this case isfp. 
On the other hand if you feel like you need to work on becoming a better person, meaning you wish to develop new traits or lose then bad ones then does that turn you into a different type?
Anyways sorry I dont have an answer for your question, but theres no point in letting people's type ranking or whatever get to you. After all it is just another person's opinion. You get to decide for yourself whether its true or not."
5398,isfp,"Some of the negative connotations associated with ISFPs I can see why some people would think, others seem pretty biased. I don‚Äôt mind claims that we are unambitious or indecisive. However claims of  us being ‚Äúintellectually challenged‚Äù or ‚Äúselfish‚Äù are bullshit IMO"
5399,isfp,"When I take the MBTI test as 'who do I wish I was', I get ESFJ, which I've been told would probably be my 'perfect match' and I can definitely see it. It makes sense I'd wish to be more extroverted and the kind of person who thinks of others before their own internal values.
Nonetheless, no, I like being an ISFP. I am flighty, artistic, and emotional. I enjoy being 'quirky' and jumping from one thing to the next or throwing myself into emotions, expressing myself through art or writing and being able to impress people with things like that."
5400,isfp,"Wow, those similarminds descriptions seem to be ""E types are good, I types are bad"" almost across the board... though ISFP has pretty much nothing positive about it in the description.  
Every type has its strengths and weaknesses so I'm not sure I'd want to be another type at this point. When I was in high school I wanted to think of myself as an INTJ, or at least the positive qualities of one that people kept listing in tests."
5401,isfp,"I used to type as INFP, but that was the result of a personality test and I wanted to believe I was one because it was more realistic than me being what I actually wish to be more like: ENFP
Also I didn't really have a good grip of what the cognitive functions are. I don't want to be more like ENFPs because of others' opinions though, it's just personal."
5402,isfp,Only issue is our natural inclinations tend not to fit with financially rewarding careers. I feel like a E_TJ get shit done type would find it easier to find a financially rewarding career that matches their interests.
5403,isfp,I like to think of esfp's as our bigger brothers/sisters of mbti. We look up to them for inspiration but we know we can never actually be them so we try and make ourselves unique and stand out in a different way
5404,isfp,I mostly typed as intp in early high school. I used to be really stoic and I suppressed my emotions because I didn't understand them. Also had no concept of the cognitive functions and I just thought intp looked pretty as a letter combination haha
5405,isfp,"well the KEY to MBTI, if it is going to have any validity- and I truly believe it does- is to entirely bypass the idiocy of modern psychologist-created psychometrics which make little sense and NEVER take a test online. Study the functions and choose yours!"
5406,isfp,"I love it when my partners give me ""stories"" in bed/tell me what they will do/describe what they are feeling. However, I tend to be more methodical and smiley in bed and knowing what to say + making myself say the sexy words is a stretch. Is this common for everyone, regardless of MBTI, or do you feel this way too?"
5407,isfp,"Yes. I get bored so easily. I can‚Äôt just have something to do, I have to have something spontaneous, meaningful and fun to do. If I get too bored, I look at my phone, but after 10 mins of that, I get bored again. Really after that, I just get really in my own head"
5408,isfp,"I apologize if this has been discussed to death but does anyone feel like their type is very...fluffy? I'm not sure how to describe it but when I compare our type descriptions to others we just seem so plain. It's not that I'm ashamed of my type or anything. It's just a bit disheartening when other types don't know much about us other than the fact that we're very nice, emo, and artistic. It bugs me when people describe us like we're the less deep INFPS. I wish people would go beyond the stupid stereotypes. Anyone feel this?"
5409,isfp,"I want to know that you are much loved, haha. I came across isfp because I thought that's what my husband was now I'm thinking he might be an istp but either way I got to know isfp is really well in that time especially through their Facebook group and I really really like them. No arguing which is rare for Facebook they were super supportive of me trying to figure out what type  he is and you guys are very very intelligent and talented and I understand the fluffy explanations of mbti because I've had issues with their ENFJ archetype description. They make a sound like we're always running around frantically trying to help other people when it's not asked for and in reality I'm more the friend that people come to because they know I give good advice and because they know I'm always going to be in their Friendship Circle and be there for them. I don't like how they make me sound like I have no life and that my life revolves completely around other people. This is because archetypes are not meant to determine type. Because there's no way to describe every single isfp and all of their behaviors and every ENFJ and all of their behaviors because people are so individualistic it would be impossible to nail it down that specifically. There's a huge variety an isfp I've noticed 
Something that might make you more proud of your type is that I learned that ISFP are very intuitive sensors. One of their cognitive functions is Ni I believe and you can learn to develop it and become more intuitive. 
Also being an intuitive type I can tell you that it's a lot more overrated than it seems. I have a friend who once was typing people based on if they have trivial conversations based on curtains and things you can see or if they had deep conversations and that's how she would tell people apart from intuitive's and sensors. This wasn't completely and totally wrong. I found that sensors in general are very much the bread to an intuitive butter. I like sensors because they are extremely grounding for me. My husband is a sensor and I wouldn't have it any other way because he is practical and he helps me appreciate the Here and Now and the sights and sounds that I miss every day. He has me leave my phone in the car and has taught me to be in tune with my senses and it's actually made me feel very peaceful. The Stars seem brighter the taste of my coffee is better and the whistle of the wind in nature is louder and I know it sounds really crazy but these are very important things and sensors tend to be more observant of their environment and they tend to be more Mindful. I'm trying to be more mindful because it's a very wonderful thing to pick up on the many things around you and your environment. 
Isfp have a lot of special things about type and they are honestly the easiest to talk to I would rather talk to you guys then another intuitive. Because only God intuitive thinkers and intuitive feelers usually have that irritating special snowflake thing going on and they only research other intuitive's or other thinkers and they particularly act like they're not human on purpose I think lol. Hope this made you feel better and I hope people start to realize that we are not our type. We have mbti to help us understand ourselves a little better but it is not a textbook definition of Who We Are.
Sorry this was so freaking long"
5410,isfp,"i feel this very much! your use of the word 'fluffy' really gets me especially because there's next to nothing talking about any deeper darker parts of our type. I think this is a problem for most sensors on the internet, though the xSTPs seem to be making a name for themselves recently. The wannabe, simplistic infp stereotype is annoying as hell. So yeah, I feel you."
5411,isfp,"As an ENTP whose type description is extremely exaggerated, I totally agree with you, MBTI descriptions are definitely intuitive biased. I mean, ENTPs are cool but not that cool. It says ""genius minds, devil's advocate who is starving for attention and information"" yet here I am watching buzzfeed tasty videos and rolling on my bed."
5412,isfp,"Yeah, hey, so I'm an INFJ that is lurking here to see what you guys are like because I don't really know any ISFP's in real life and I don't really get what you guys are ""all about.""
So this topic is funny to me because as an INFJ I feel like there is a lot of bullshit surrounding descriptions of my type: ""Empathetic mystical catalyst wizard blahblahblahs.""
So I guess all I can say to you is you aren't the only person who hates the preconceived type descriptions."
5413,isfp,"yes! i agree with this! as a lurking enfp, i find that my description is very specific and very true to me, whereas when researching the elusive isfp, there were a lot of general things, and very few useful things for this personality type. i had to do a lot of my own research (mostly, reading through this subreddit), and found commonalities that weren't necessarily listed online, things like shyness, isfp's being really really funny (a lot of my isfp friends make hilarious quirky remarks that leave me doubled over in laughter), cautious, passive, musically/artistically talented, especially prone to touch and acts of service as love languages etc :)"
5414,isfp,"I agree, MBTI isn't supposed to be a limitation, just something to better understand ourselves. Those posts that try to find romantic advice from different types always confuse me because it's not a type issue, it's usually a person-specific issue. Sensors and intuitives seem to balance each other quite well in relationships. Unfortunately there's a lot of intuitive bias on the test and around different MBTI forums, though they're getting better. I guess I never really thought about being practical as a good thing and thought it implied that you were unimaginative. I'm glad there's reassurance that not everyone listens to the awful stereotypes. I feel a lot better about my type, thanks :)"
5415,isfp,You can also be practical and imaginative. I think people have a hard time seeing that people can be more than one thing. U can use facts and emotion. U can be creative but still practical in day to day life. U can be fun but serious at the right times etc
5416,isfp,"It's such a highly idealized concept..I feel as though it loses its appeal/uniqueness when too much importance and attention is focused on it. Like if I am beautiful, it's not why I want my partner to like me or approach me or focus on. "
5417,isfp,"No. Beauty comes in many forms, including things some may find ugly or creepy (certain types of art, old abandoned buildings, people who don't fit the ideal because they have features like big noses or unusual facial structures). There's way too much diversity for me to ever feel bored. "
5418,isfp,"I am rather split. While I dislike my partners to like me for my looks, I like them mostly based on looks. But ofc I am male and I grew up in a world where male beauty is considered to be gay or feminine, while for women it's considered the uttermost important thing to have. In my head my brain tells me that male models is the most lousy occupations a male can have. It's worse than cleaning toilets. I know it's not how it is, but my brain and instinct tells me it is. But I don't think I will be bored of Beaty no. But beauty is connected to sexuality. And I hope when I get old and sex lust drops like a stone I will not care anymore:)"
5419,isfp,"Hi everyone! I was wondering if ISFP have the tendency to enter rebound relationships as initiators or if they are themselves more often ""victims"" of such a relationship? Does it last, does it not? Did it eventually turn out a ""real thing""? Thank you in advance for your insights."
5420,isfp,"Personally, as an ISFP I feel that after my relationship ended (about a year ago) I couldn't bring myself to enter into another one. I did date to distract myself, but nothing stemmed from them. I also found myself unable to form romantic connections with another guy. Of course post relationship actions would also be effected by what kind of past relationship you had.
Also, I would never let myself enter a ""rebound relationship""; mentally I know that it would be better to take time to love myself not based on someone else's admiration for me and to rediscover how to live alone. 
Lastly,(in the sense of being someone else's rebound) as someone mentioned previously, ""I see that shit coming from a mile away"" as in, come on, it's just not a good idea to date someone that just came out of a relationship. Not only are they probably just looking for someone to fill the hole that their ex partners left, if I really cared about them I would understand that it would benefit them more to have some alone time to figure out how to be themselves again.
tldr: my thoughts as an ISFP on rebounds, bad idea"
5421,isfp,"yes, until I noticed the pattern and stopped it.
I seemed to only get people who were just out of relationships or otherwise emotionally unavailable who were interested for the long time. 
Whether that's a a function of ISFP or just a stage in my life im not sure.. "
5422,isfp,"Every relationship I've had has been a rebound (I'm his rebound). The first one lasted over a year. The second one lasted about 2 weeks. In both situations, I knew what I was getting into and I knew it wouldn't work out but it's was nice to feel needed even if it wasn't real. "
5423,isfp,"Precisely :) 
Rebound is a romantic interaction or something giving this impression between someone who just ended another one (usually a long term relationship) and initiates directly another one. Most of the time rebound relationships are with a new person who is not aware that she or he are ""fixing"" the mess prior to their arrival. "
5424,isfp,"Sometimes I can have trouble moving on from things but I don't ever regret anything; I just don't see the point. I guess I take everything as a positive learning experience. I'd only feel regret if I did something terrible, which I haven't done."
5425,isfp,"I regret opening up to and trusting certain people, but that‚Äôs mainly because I knew not to proceed with them in the first place but I ignored my own intuition and ended up feeling stupid.
I think ISFP intuition is underrated. Mine is always on point, yet I rarely trust it and I don‚Äôt know why.
I guess because the heart wants what it wants, regardless of whether it‚Äôs a good idea or not."
5426,isfp,"I relate. I don‚Äôt regret anything, really. It‚Äôs almost like I do not feel the feeling of regret. That is one thing I dislike about myself because there are plenty of things I‚Äôve done in the past that I should regret doing but I simply do not. "
5427,isfp,"I completely agree. Of course, I feel embarrassment  sometimes, but I don‚Äôt regret. My mistakes have shaped me into who I currently am, and my life would be entirely different if I never did anything stupid. "
5428,isfp,"I picture my intuition as an INFJ/Lisa Simpson voice that always sees through the bullshit and all the ways my recklessness is going to fuck me up down the road. Everything tells me not to proceed.
But then my FiSe impulsiveness is an ESTP/Bart Simpson character that clasps his hand over her mouth like, ‚ÄúWhat she‚Äôs trying to say is let‚Äôs give this a shot, see where it goes, and we can just figure things out as we go along!‚Äù 
/commence making bad decision"
5429,isfp,"ISTP, but I frequently mistype as ISFP. I would venture to say my F/T fluctuates in the 45-55% margin based on my mood when I take the test.
My job at the the flea market is really hard to explain. Some days I run the concessions stand all day. Some days I can never get away from the front desk. Some days I am a full on accountant. Some days I am working a maintenance job all day. Some days I direct traffic. Some days I'm just a janitor. Some days I do public relations work all day. Some days I spend the entire day running around arguing with people. Some days I play the role as secretary. Some days I honestly don't do anything. The owner will always find something for me to do, and lets me do it at my own pace. I usually come to him after doing something with something else in mind. He just leaves me to my own devices for the most part.
Really my job could just be described as, ""The guy with a radio who knows how to do everything."" I have more keys than the manager. I spend a lot of time just walking around and conversing with the vendors to see what needs to get done to make everyone happy. Thats about as accurate a description as I can give. I swear I'm the only one who knows how anything works sometimes. I never fully know what I will be doing day to day, and you know what. 10/10. Best job I have ever had. I will work for that man until he dies."
5430,isfp,"I'm a stagehand. I work with the team of people in a theater who install and operate the lighting, audio, and video equipment, as well as the sets. My focus is in audio, but I've played a roll in every department. 
I love my job. I get to work alongside creative people who put their hearts and souls into their art every day. We try to anticipate their needs, and translate their vision into reality. At the end of the day, they're grateful for our help. If they're not, screw em! Their stuff is on a truck, they're heading to another city, and we'll be working with a new show tomorrow. 
I'm part of the experience that people in the audience take for granted, which is more satisfying to me than being someone who stands before them to preform. Nobody thinks about how a show progresses from one scene to the next, or how you can hear a vocalist singing clearly at a concert, or what controls all the pretty lights. That's us, we did that. 
Admittedly, my schedule is insane. I work a lot of nights and weekends. Week to week, my gigs are completely inconsistent. If I wasn't in a Union, I know I wouldn't be paid well enough to make it in the town I'm in. Thank God for my Union. 
I don't have a degree. I'm hired because production managers know that I can do what they need me to do. The theater runs on merit. If you're good at what you do, you'll get the opportunity to do it more. 
The work environment is very casual and comfortable. My coworkers are crass, sarcastic, not politically correct, loud, bombastic, tattood, pierced, dirty pirates. They're also some of the kindest, most understanding, intelligent people you'll ever meet. We've got a lot of introverts. If there's time to kill, we find our corners and read our books, and everybody's cool with that. 
If you think you might want to do theatrical tech, follow that dream. You can make a living. Go for a degree in something you can fall back on, and work in community and college theaters in the meantime.
It will be hard, but you knew that. People in your life might never understand why you're never free when they are. You'll probably find yourself hanging out with other stagehands, actors, musicians, and bartenders. 
I can't stress this enough: join the Union! IATSE is the organization that will fight for you to have a living wage, healthcare, a retirement plan, safe working conditions, meal breaks, and other important rights. 
It's hard to assign a number rating to my job. I've know pretty much forever that I've wanted to work with music without necessarily being a musician, so I'm kind of living my dream. The schedule makes it more than a job though. It's a lifestyle. I don't have normal weekends, and work rarely ends at 5PM, so it's challenging to keep up with friends outside the business. If I could go back and pick something else though, I really don't think I would. I've been doing this professionally for eight years, and never once have I laid awake in bed in the morning and thought ""I don't want to do my job today."" I've been tired, and wanted to keep sleeping, sure, but get some coffee in me, and the enthusiasm survives. 
EDIT: I wanted to add, I love how work can't come with me. I have to physically be in the theater to do my job. There's no finishing up a project in my free time at home. "
5431,isfp,"I work part time as a portrait photographer and part time as a pet shop employee. Both have their good and bad points but I would say both are 9/10 because I enjoy both, but working in customer service is draining and both jobs require strong people skills. "
5432,isfp,"security guard - 6/10 
the place i work is nice and calm, but the job doesn't pay that well. I want to get into graphic design but I'm having a hard time getting started. I have some experience from several years ago, but with different programs so only thing that really translates is stuff about color and design itself. learning programs will be completely new for me "
5433,isfp,"Im working in a cinema, mostly service but part of my job is representing my cinema at the union which requires me to travel to different cities and listen to angry arguments between company and union. 
Checking schedules of staff as well. I love it aaand 8/10 because of little money.
Planning to start an apprenticeship as phyiotherapist. 3 years in germany to learn that"
5434,isfp,What a dream! You run you're own photography buisiness? My dad used to be a photographer and I enjoy taking photos too. I wouldn't mind working part time as one but I can't find any work. Working in a pet shop sounds lit too! 
5435,isfp,"There's a school here in Canada for it, 2 year course. I just changed trades in the military though, was a combat engineer before. Getting paid a full salary while going to school was such a sweet deal."
5436,isfp,"Yeah I've recently gotten a job as a second shooter for a wedding photographer but it's not in my area so it's a bit of travel, so I understand there's a limited amount of opportunities.. Thays why I'm making my own. For my own business it's all just been trying to promote myself and word of mouth, it doesn't pay the bills yet hence the pet shop job but I'm very lucky to be doing two things that I love. "
5437,isfp,"I still have my Nikon D3300 that I bought in high school and I'm working on saving up for something better but it's hard because my boyfriend and I have our own place and lots of general expenses, and my savings are now going to a new car because mine has multiple mechanical issues. I have learned that newer and ""better cameras"" don't necessarily have to mean that your pictures will be better as long as you learn how to use what you already have to the best of your abilities, better cameras just make your job a little easier. As for my lenses I have a variety but my go to portrait lens is a tamron 45mm f 1.8 (I also love my Nikor 50mm f 1.8 but because they're both fixed, 45mm is more versatile just because I can use it in closer situations and have more background, not a huge difference but any bit helps!) "
5438,isfp,"Thanks a lot! I have a photography instagram account too @dztrippics you can check some of my photos if you want. I need to start posting again more. Im saving up for a lense, I was thinking 85mm f1.8 maybe. When I get this lense I will start taking more portraits. I will check out your lenses too :) thanks for input"
5439,isfp,"I‚Äôve been seeing this ISFP male for a almost a year now, and to sum it down, this is what has been doing on:

Go out for a few dates, I ask him where he sees this going and he says ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go with the flow‚Äù
2/3 months pass, still ‚Äúgoing with the flow‚Äù, essentially not much has happened apart from more dates and a mini getaway 
I ask him again, he says he doesn‚Äôt want anything serious any time soon, and I take that as a sign of him not being interested 
I start seeing ENTP male, and after becoming FWB with ENTP, ISFP opens up and says a load of things along the line of ‚ÄúI saw a future with you... I thought we were working on something together... I was in love with you‚Äù
I end things with ENTP, a few months pass and immediately and ISFP become closer than ever. 
I ask ISFP today where he sees this going (once again) because it‚Äôs taking longer than usual for me to see any sign towards a future. By this point, we‚Äôve spent countless nights together and have done very intimate things, and he replied ‚Äúmy head isn‚Äôt right, I don‚Äôt want to be serious right now but that doesn‚Äôt mean never‚Äù.

What the hell is this guy‚Äôs issue? He‚Äôs fine with opening up, becoming physically intimate and doesn‚Äôt like it when I talk about other guys, but as soon as I bring up anything future related, there‚Äôs always something wrong with him?"
5440,isfp,"ISFP 25M. Shit I feel like you're talking about me. I'm just going to assume I'm the guy in this relationship and explain what I feel.
First of all I'm complicated af. I'm afraid of long term commitments. Deep down I know i want one but I want the RIGHT one. Problem is Idk what the ""right one"" is and committing to something that I'm not sure is ""right"" is hard for me. I don't like lying and I care deeply about your feelings so it's hard for me to give you a definitive answer when you ask me questions like ""where do you see this going?"". I don't want to just tell you something I know you want to hear nor do I want to say something that may not turn out to be true later on. I guess the most appropriate answer would be ""I'm confused, I like you alot but I'm just not sure""? Also I'm a jealous type. Not like psychotic jealous or anything though. I want your love and your time however I'm really not the best at expressing it. If I learn you're seeing someone else it's definitely going to make me feel some type of way. I would prefer for a long term relationship to form organically. I don't plan anything. I barely know what's going on tomorrow nvm a few years from now.
So to answer your question in short: if he's an ISFP that's like me he's confused and indecisive af. Not a bad guy just unsure about everything and trying to only take things a day at a time to avoid further confusion.
Like I said I'm complicated af. I hope this makes sense and helps you out to know what's going on a bit. Might not be him exactly though as there are many factors that contribute to my romance issues so keep that in mind as well."
5441,isfp,"It sounds like he doesn‚Äôt think your relationship is ideal but he also doesn‚Äôt want to share you with anyone else.  I wouldn‚Äôt put a lot of faith in this guy if I were you, OP. He sounds selfish and fickle from your description."
5442,isfp,"loll.. yeah you should stop dating this guy. He doesn't know what he wants. Going with the flow means taking it slowly, not just completely bulldozing someone else's life. He doesn't want to be controlled but will happily control you - that's not a healthy ISFP. Just a shitty one."
5443,isfp,"Damn... ouch. I'm female but ouch, kinda relate lolll.
I probably wouldn't say 'I don't want anything serious' if I want to be with a guy long term, but I can relate to him sort of just... idk, waiting things out and not jumping too quickly, but that has more to do with my anxiety and lack of trust more than my personality type.
He seems wishy washy. Straight up tell him what you need, what you're looking for, and if he doesn't want that but still manipulates with the whole ""buht I saw'd a futureeeee togederrr"", he's just annoying and should def just end any attempts with him.
That's easier said than done. I lack any experience with relationships I've literally been with one guy in high school and recently started seeing him again, soooooo ignore me.
Just here to say I wish you luck ;_;"
5444,isfp,"sounds like he probably is bad at saying that he doesn't want anything serious. he just wants to have fun with you but doesn't want commitment of a relationship, just doesn't know how to say that without it coming across as rude or in a way that would end the relationship. honestly I have a hard time telling people who are interested in me that I'm not interested sometimes, especially if I enjoy their company
I also sort of relate to this kind of thing, I don't want to go into it too much but I don't like commitment either unless I know the person is right. I don't date much for the most part though and that works for me, till I find the right person I guess"
5445,isfp,"This isn't an ISFP issue per se. 
Its tired and cliche', but he just doesn't sound into you. He missed you because you left and it hurt not necessarily because he wanted to be with you. 
Might be wrong."
5446,isfp,"The way you press ISFPs is by enforcing a deadline.
either you do this now in in X number of minutes/hours/days/weeks.
anything immediately  they say thereafter you hold them to their word.
if they conflict then you say that that isn't what they said."
5447,isfp,I think Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller would be a good book for you and OP and everyone really to read. Sounds like you and OPs SO have avoidant attachment styles. There‚Äôs ways to have a more secure attachment style and better communication in this book.
5448,isfp,"I am normally understanding. I rarely get angry. But when my personal limit is hit, I get extremely angry. Especially when I had to spend too much time with an unpleasant person. I wanna lash out and rant, but I get sorta frustrated and I get physical like kicking a door or slamming my fist on the desk. Are some of you like me or do I need therapy?"
5449,isfp,"How expressive are you of your displeasure generally? I find when I bottle up my anger or dismiss annoyances because they're ""not a big deal"", I can get pretty ragey over random things. It's like, trying to out a lid on the anger only to have it spill over everywhere else.
I really don't like when I get like this, because I often end up lashing out at people who have nothing to do with whatever I'm angry about. Even if it sounds dumb, talking about it while it's still a small issue helps to diffuse. If there's no one who'll listen, just saying ""I'm so <optional expletive"
5450,isfp,"I get like that sometimes too. If you want to work on it, look up Distress Tolerance, Mindfulness or DBT therapy. All three of those helped me let emotions go easier so that I wouldn't get so worked up."
5451,isfp,"I totally get you. I am just so calm always that friends tell me they can't even imagine me perturbed. I sometimes am creepily calm in situations. But when I lose my temper, I LOSE IT. Love venting by breaking things that are disposable, punching the wall, screaming into pillows etc. This is partly because I don't want people to see this side of me. "
5452,isfp,"My father is very stubborn and controlling. He never wanted me to live as myself. He saw me as an extension of himself. I felt that is wrong. So I rebelled. It was hard because he‚Äôs an adult with resources and I was a broke child. Before I moved out, I had a fight with him and I kicked a door off its hinges. I‚Äôm scrawny and not really strong so it was a surprise. I felt like someone else kicked the door through my body. 
I am very calm and peaceful when I‚Äôm with good people. I can tolerate bad people for some time, keeping my poker face. But sometimes my rage is uncontrollable when unleashed. It happens only once or twice a year. Hopefully less so now that I have my own life independent from everyone. "
5453,isfp,"DAE do this? Like go through your Facebook every year or so and delete two thirds of the people? Or decide you‚Äôre ‚Äúover‚Äù certain mutual friends or acquaintances in real life, and start systematically burning bridges?
Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúsystematically‚Äù, because with me it almost feels like an internal tantrum or something. Pent up aggression that boils over and next thing I know I‚Äôm nuking every relationship except for the two or three people dearest to me.
I thought I‚Äôd outgrown these urges but no. 
People never talk about the misanthropic side of ISFPs, and I‚Äôm not sure why?
I often quote this guy even though that movie is old and ridiculous because this scene is hilariously dead-on."
5454,isfp,"Yeah I've done the Facebook friend sweep. I've also ghosted many many friends I felt were dragging me down, and I always feel guilty for how I go about it but in the long run I'm always glad I did. Unless I have a very strong connection with somebody it's very easy for me to leave them. "
5455,isfp,Yeah i used to back when i was on there. Eventually i just deleted my Facebook because i barely used it anyways and i hated having to decide whether or not to wish ppl happy birthday or not all the damn time.
5456,isfp,"The only two things that I HATE is when someone in my family doesn't knock the door and I'm changing clothes, and when I'm on discord talking with someone and another person makes noise or even talk, making the people on discord listen to them."
5457,isfp,"Depending how in my face they are. Like if they stop their car and start telling at me because I honked when they cut me off, I smile and nod until they realize what they are doing. If they are like, why don't know take the trash out, I get defensive "
5458,isfp,"There is one older guy who every day would bother me when I was eating my dinner. He would come right up to me and say ""how's it goin?!"" very intrusively. And every time, I would ignore him, and wait for him to leave. Needless to say, he did not get the hint. He would just stare at me and wait as if I'm supposed to respond to him, who is essentially a stranger. Honestly he gave me the CREEPS like no one else, that's why I wouldn't talk to him, aside from the extreme intrusiveness/crudeness/social ineptitude.
If that's not a nightmare for us, idk what is."
5459,isfp,"Cause they make sense once you understand the animal. They dont just turn around and bite you for no reason cause they had a hard day at work. If they dont like being near you, they let you know. People lie about how they are, intentionaly or not. "
5460,isfp,"Because they are drawn to me and I cannot help but love them. My husband calls it the Snow White effect üòÇ He said I‚Äôm like a beacon of light to animals...they see it and here they come. He is an intp that has never been into animals as much but has gotten more attuned to them being with me for 17 years. He absolutely loves our little Feist rescue. 
I cannot explain the weird connection to animals and nature I have ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It feels like a soul thing though. Like I just get them and they get me, so there‚Äôs a mutual love and respect thing going on there. "
5461,isfp,"I'm most likely an INFP (although I could possibly be an ISFP), and I love animals because I feel a deep, unending empathy towards them. They have a pure innocence and I think that they are much more intelligent and smarter than we as humans tend to view them. I think that they daydream the way we do, and have deep hopes and feelings, and experiences the way we do. Not all of them seem to be drawn to me, but I'm drawn to them because I can see and feel their hearts in mine. I can connect to them on inherent level-we are both misunderstood and often unappreciated because we are constantly immersed on our own inner worlds, and we seldom share those inner worlds unless we truly trust those we share it with. My heart breaks when I think of how horribly they are treated. They have souls, they have lives. And while I understand that eating them is a part of many cultural traditions and is sometimes a part of necessity, they should not be mass slaughtered or mistreated, subject like slaves to the corruption and greed of our human nature. It's absolutely heart-shattering."
5462,isfp,i think he‚Äôs saying isfps like animals sometimes more than other types because they are bad at explaining their feelings and animals aren‚Äôt complicated; they either like you or don‚Äôt. it‚Äôs easier for them than the minefield of human emotions and trying to express themselves to people who don‚Äôt understand. i might be reading between the lines too much... i‚Äôm entp 
5463,isfp,"Anyone else find that they digest the information from what they're reading easier when they read it out loud? When I'm reading I often have to go back and read the same sentence 2-3 times for it to fully sink in, but what I read it out loud I only have to read it once or twice. Still though, when I'm reading to someone else I tend to go in to a different mode where I power through getting the words out and not really get the meaning of what I'm speaking for myself."
5464,isfp,Yes! I had to do this to memorize terms for my insurance exams. It was the only way for me to memorize stuff that were so booorring. Otherwise i would be reading the same paragraph for hours trying to grasp the subject.
5465,isfp,"100% yup. When reading to others the focus for me tends to be on my voice, how suitable it sounds for the subject-matter, how engaging it is for the listeners. The content of the actual text goes over my head :)"
5466,isfp,"‚Äã
There is a ""TL;DR:"" below. Don't worry guys.
‚Äã
‚Äã

‚Äã
‚Äã
In October I decided to leave my career during my third year. I felt very tired, not wanting to do more homework. In classes no one thought like me and I didn't see a future as an art teacher either. I also lost the habit of lifting weights. In December I felt like I had more free time, but I had 2 part-time jobs and I decided to leave my job as a waiter to be calmer with my job at the pizzeria.
‚Äã
In January I began to notice how alone I was. My best friend, M, only texted to me if I texted to him before. It seemed he wasn't interested in me. So I stopped talking to him. Each time I went down a little more. It was getting worse every time. Until this month that I was fired from my job, without explanation.
‚Äã
I lost everything because of my decisions. Now I'm besieged by my regrets and worries. I feel terrible because I'm 24 and still don't know what to do with my life because I always end up doing stupid shit like that. I feel old. Nothing in my hands. There was also the pressure to run out of food.
‚Äã
‚Äã

‚Äã
‚Äã
What I'm going to do now.
Unfuck myself. I recently sent a message to my old job as a waiter. The boss loved me very much that she told me to go to work today. Also, I think I'm going back to university or get a full time job for this year.
‚Äã
‚Äã

‚Äã
‚Äã
Things that help me when I'm depressed.
this could have an effect on you or not, but at least, if you propose small things and you do them, somehow your brain is taking off the depression because you're doing something.
‚Äã
‚Ä¢ Order your space. Room or home.
I noticed that when my room is tidy, my mind too. ""Your body is your mind"".
‚Äã
‚Ä¢ Do it.
this is my favorite because is the only thing I can memorize: ""The habit of getting shit done"". Just set an appointment and make it. Choose something possible to do, and do it. It doesn't matter how you feel about it. It doesn't matter if you're too fucking depressed to do anything. Just do the thing, every single day whether you feel like it or not.
‚Äã
The success doesn't depend on your big idea, or planification, or how much did you think in something. Is what you fucking do what matters.
‚Äã
‚Ä¢ Take a shower everyday.
I didn't do it. But the feeling of post-shower and that freshness is really helpful to make you think better and to mantain a minimal routine that makes each day to be separated from the other. I also will take more care of my little beard.
‚Äã
‚Ä¢ If you can, wake up at the same time everyday.
I broke my circadian rhythm 2 months ago. There is nothing more depressing than waking up and watch the sunset. Also, morning is motivating.
‚Äã
‚Ä¢ Propose to yourself, only 2 or 3 things, no more.
It depends on you, but I can't handle so many things in my mind, which is a bad thing because I find many many things interesting. But now I'm playing with just 3 available slots: 1) A job: This is obligatory for me. 2) A career: maybe I will come back to university or use this space of time to another skill 3) A skill that you like to learn: I'm learning a new language. 4) drawing: A little one is to improve my drawing skills.
‚Äã
‚Ä¢ Before taking a decision, talk to your friends.
I took a lot of stupid decisions. You need other points of view.
‚Äã
‚Ä¢ DON'T OVERLOAD YOURSELF.
I did it and I got fucked up. Don't choose so many activities because you will not be abble to respond well.
‚Äã
‚Äã

‚Äã
‚Äã
TL;DR:
Poor aux Se, silly Ni and absent Te made me commit a lot of mistakes.
‚Äã
Poor Se: take care of your environment. order your room. Don't overload yourself. Be direct and simple. don't complicate yourself.
Silly Ni: I took a lot of bad decisions from incongruous presumptions of the future. Don't assume things that you do not know if they are real. Talk to your friends before making a decision. Ask your friends to help you see the future that you want to have.
Special mention, Fi: just don't let your emotions fuck everything and dominate your life. Think what your true feelings are, and put them above your feelings of the moment.
Te: Learn the habit of getting shit done. See above in ""‚Ä¢ Do it"". Choose something and do it. No matter how you feel. Be direct and simple."
5467,isfp,"I just read the TL:DR(I might go back and read full post later), but you seem like you have the right idea. good luck with getting stuff done! I have found that it sort of leads to a snowball effect, and usually starts with just one small step"
5468,isfp,"This sounds like you've been doing a lot of positive thinking, good on you. You're right about not overloading yourself. Just start off relatively small and you can get the ball rolling and build some momentum.
I personally find exercise with a goal in mind to be really important for me. I was at my most efficient and proactive when I was training for a marathon. The knock-on effect that something like that brings to the rest of your life just can't be overstated.
I'm currently in a bit of a downturn myself, a depressive episode I'll call it. I'm going to give myself a kick up the backside today and go and make things work again. Thanks for sharing."
5469,isfp,"Got into school for engineering because I was told they didn't work in an office environment (lol) Hated everything about it and dreaded going to class. Halfway through freshman year my mom got really ill and had to stay in complete bed rest for a couple months, requiring me to take care of her completely. It caused my grades to go down but I   realized then that I was good at the whole nurturing thing. Still not convinced about studying medicine though. Switched majors a few times while I took art classes. Loved the art classes, loved the people and the environment but I felt pretty useless doing nothing but art 24/7 (like my work wouldn't change the world no matter how hard I tried, that kinda feeling) so I majored in health science with a minor in art. Loved the philosophy of it and the idea of helping others in ways that have an immediate impact, hated feeling stuck in the office-like environment and the bureaucracy of it. Thought back on my mom getting sick and finally decided to give medicine a try. Researched all the different fields. Decided to follow a PA track, which meant going back to school. I just finished my emt course and I loved every second of it. Taking the summer off while I study for my certification and going back to take my prereqs next semester. Couldn't be more excited. 
All I can tell you is that it will come to you, eventually. Pressuring it and freaking out about it only seems to make it worse because then you narrow your vision and miss out on potential opportunities. Don't sweat it, work on yourself and getting to know yourself first and it'll all come together :) "
5470,isfp,"29/F I spent a lot of time in school and avoiding any kind of job interview. I would just land jobs that were desperate for people (mostly office work I'm very tech savvy) but I never felt like I fit in with the ""girls"" at the front desk. 
I decided I would pursue an education in my two favorite subjects, geography and computers.  I was fiercely competitive in school for my post grad and loved the information. I managed to again, land a job that was desperate for someone. It happened to be a helicopter company and I've been loyal to them ever since, doing office and field work. 
After reading my type - I see the weaknesses I have are very clear as to why I can have difficult times at work, but I also see how my strengths make me the ideal candidate for my career. Just need to whittle down the weaknesses - maybe do some public speaking? Never mind, already regret typing that. "
5471,isfp,"I always thought there was something wrong with my because I didn't have any ""passions"" in life. Started working at a brew pub as a waitress in college and fell in love with the craft beer industry. I now do marketing for a craft beer company. I think your passion is still out there, and you'll know it when you find it."
5472,isfp,"Went to college right out of high school for journalism and loved the coursework but hated the school. Dropped out and worked customer service for a few years, thinking I would go back when I knew what I wanted to do. Boyfriend got a pretty serious infection on his hand and stayed in the hospital for a week, and visiting him there made me realize that I would really love to work in healthcare. Halfway through nursing school and love it üòä"
5473,isfp,"I tried for years to convince myself I was someone I'm not, because my family expected it (though I honestly didn't realize and always thought I was 'above' that kind of thing). It took struggling through like five years of college for me to finally give up and admit to myself that my passion, which has always been my passion, is the only way for me to go. And that it was time to stop fighting my nature because I didn't think it was good enough."
5474,isfp,"I generally like types 1, 4 and 9 the most.
2 is nice as well but I don't really understand them, and I don't need to be around them that much. Don't really know about 5 or 6, but they seem fine. 7 is very hit or miss.
I don't like 3 and 8."
5475,isfp,"I honestly find it kind of weird when i see and read posts about some people going out and ‚Äúlooking for xxxx‚Äù people. Like do you guys stalk them to figure it out? or do you just go up to them and straight up ask what‚Äôs your personality type. And say you guys just talk and end up passively picking it up from how they act and say you found them to be Enfp, how do you know that‚Äôs what they really are? What if they‚Äôre just a completely different person? Maybe they had a bad day and they‚Äôre being more passive, or maybe something else.
I‚Äôm not mad or bashing anyone for doing certain things because it doesn‚Äôt involve me, i‚Äôm just genuinely curious as to how and why you do it. Why can‚Äôt you just find someone and figure out who they are and how the chemistry is between the two of you as people and not as personalities. 
I found most of my friends through online games and highschool and more recently car meets, all different kinds of people, some way more out there than others, but i know we have good chemistry for friendships because of the things we like. 
Sorry if it sounds like i‚Äôm attacking again, it just kinda flipped a switch after reading how to meet similar types."
5476,isfp,"I'm not really the best at typing.
For me it's mostly the vibe someone gives, then once I've narrowed down possible types it's just analysis.
For example; INTP
I find that INTPs are often rather quiet and don't really visibly emote much (they mostly just seem to stare blankly and look at people questioningly). Some also have rather erratic movement (I've seen a couple that look like they're vibrating constantly). This still does give me some doubts, because they could still be INFP (although they often smile more) or ISTP (although they often have more normal movement).
After some conversation they also don't really seem repulsed by any topic I bring up (INFPs might respond negatively to certain topics) and take everything very seriously (ISTPs might find certain topics uninteresting and bullshit). So I go with INTP."
5477,isfp,"like others have said, I type usually after I've met a person and am curious about why they think the way they do and just out of curiosity about people in general. I usually type by letters first - whether someone is introverted/extroverted, thinking/feeling, intuitive/sensing, judging/perceiving. This can be difficult until you get to know them better and understand why they do the things they do (because on the surface we can all seem pretty similar). And then I refine by using function stacks - so I know that ISFPs first two functions are introverted feeling and extraverted sensing etc. I almost always confirm by getting them to take a test so that I don't build up false data points. And now that I've met so many people and information about their type, I can usually tell by vibe."
5478,isfp,"I‚Äôm terrible at typing people. I don‚Äôt really go out of my way to try, but sometimes I am curious. Such as ‚Äúhm what type is this coworker I quite like?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI wonder what type that really loud, obnoxious person is?‚Äù. It‚Äôs just a curious attempt at understanding why things are the way they are. But again, I am absolutely terrible at it and just give up. 
Anyone I do ‚Äútype‚Äù is usually just a feeling. As in, I don‚Äôt have any evidence, but this person just gives off certain ‚Äúvibes‚Äù or something. Perhaps that‚Äôs slightly based off stereotypes though; and I don‚Äôt use it seriously."
5479,isfp,"I usually take a guess after I've gotten to know them/ been around them a long time.   First I guess whether their introverted or extraverted because that's the clearest one. I mean you can't tell me you've never picked up on whether a person is more outgoing or has a more quiet energy. It's something you can tell after a while. After that I guess whether they're more thinking vs feeling which is the second easiest, then sensor vs intuitive, then perceiving vs judging. 
You kind of have to have a good understanding of what those things are too and be able to pick them up in people's motivations and actions. And no you don't ""stalk"" people it's just that when you have an understanding of the functions it's just kind of something you start to readily observe without trying. 
Also I always take my speculations with a grain of salt since you can always only ever see one side of a person most of the time and also It would be dumb to just take my own isolated opinion and perception as fact."
5480,isfp,"By The vipe i get of them. Still building reportuar, this is how i see them in a nutshell.
Infp: slow moving and theire existens is like ""what about this and it could be this? Think i might be an intp but i could also be intj""
Intp(my dad): ""i have this really cool idea(original) about or why do people do this?"" It makes no sense followed by 15-45min Ti rant or lecture about why it makes no sense to film vertically or something.
there is absolutely no ending to this.
Isfp: man, just listen to this part! Me and my sister is this way haha
Istj: knows alot information/details about the darnes little things. Don't like to talk about people for reason.
Esfj: super warm. Get a positive vibe feedback loop with them haha.
xxtj: not people persons. Controlling.
Usually don't match well with people inside this group."
5481,isfp,"Yeah, same. I'm starting to think this might be more of a SJ thing than a sensor thing in general."
5482,isfp,"It‚Äôs not that it goes too deep, because I can get into super deep and abstract things, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve gotta be interested, and that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll probably lose me, deep or not. If I‚Äôm not interested, I become very easily distracted, and it shows."
5483,isfp,"Hi, how are you?
Ideas, don't know. People generally just post on their own about their hobbies and each other's. Also some random postings about jobs and education. Maybe if there was a structured thread about a topic every week there might be more posts. Don't know, just an idea"
5484,isfp,"Has anyone else experienced the feeling of complete disconnection with reality? I've only felt it a few times, normally when I'm in a lot of emotional pain. However, today in class I experienced it again. I was just curious if this is common among people with this personality type. "
5485,isfp,"many times, i lose track of what somebody else is saying because my mind drifts off to emptiness for no reason. i feel numbed and completely out of touch with my surroundings on days like these and just can‚Äôt wait for the day to be over. sigh i hate being on autopilot "
5486,isfp,"Hi, this is an old post, sorry.
I experience this usually after having too much caffeine.
What helps me is counting colors, textures, shapes, sounds, steps, ceiling tiles, looking at family pictures, and doing whatever was on ""my"" (haha doesn't feel like me anymore) to do list before I left normal."
5487,isfp,"Looking back at the events that lead to me writing this post, I was extremely depressed and had very little sleep. I just remember sitting in class and it felt like someone flipped a switch and everything felt staged. I remeber thinking ""If my professor calls on me, I dont think I would even respond."" It was a crazy feeling. Everything felt weightless and empty. "
5488,isfp,"Hey, DFalcon60, just a quick heads-up:
remeber is actually spelled remember. You can remember it by -mem- in the middle.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
5489,isfp,"So I‚Äôm an INFP gal who is low-key trying to make this ISFP guy fall for me. I‚Äôve been stalking this forum like crazy for insights, so I know they value practical or heartfelt gifts. We flirt a lot, but we‚Äôre not that close. I was thinking of making him a small single serving birthday cake and show him my feminine charm (plus it‚Äôs one of the few practical things I‚Äôm good at). Is this too much too soon? Would it creep him out? If so, what are other non-creepy options? Any advice will help. "
5490,isfp,"that sounds really nice, I would really appreciate that personally 
I don't know if it'll seem like too much too soon though, how long have you been talking to him? Also if it's a lot of work for you it might seem kind of weird, but I don't know. I would do what feels right in your mind and trust your gut. if it seems like too much then you could make him something less complicated(like a few cookies or muffins or something)"
5491,isfp,"Is it warm where you are? As an ISFP, I'd love to be taken to some trails/scenery to explore. We feel and sense everything in nature and it's amazing. 
I'm honestly not too into tangible things, but that's just me. I definitely appreciate thoughtful gestures!"
5492,isfp,"It‚Äôs a boxed cake, it‚Äôs not going to be much trouble at all, and I‚Äôve known him for eight months or so, but our contact has been sporadic. It just picked back up recently. But he said he didn‚Äôt have any plans so I thought it might be a nice gesture. I just know that he (and ISFPs in general) seem to be a little skittish when they perceive things as going too fast too soon. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm overthinking it. I want him to know that I care, but not have him read too much into it if that makes sense? 
Even though he‚Äôd probably be right to read into it, since I am trying to get him to like me , ha. He‚Äôs been hurt in the past, so he‚Äôs in a keep things casual, no relationship phase. I know he‚Äôs attracted to me, but I want him to actually like me as well. "
5493,isfp,"That's funny, oh no, I would never do that. I'd be too afraid to see his reaction if he didn't think it was good. I'm planning on asking him if it's okay to stop by when I'm on my way somewhere so I have a reason to leave. "
5494,isfp,"Sounds good, I don't think it would be too much if you've known him for that long. I have been turned off by people being too fast with stuff, but that's usually after I've known them just for a week or two and also when I'm not attracted to them. It doesn't sound like that's the case here though. 
Seems like it's worth a try, see how things go"
5495,isfp,"The thing with narcissists they often have a lot of initial charm, and that can draw a lot of people in, since people are very influenced by first impressions. Some can come across as very confident and assertive which is a trait that ISFPs can be drawn to. "
5496,isfp,"Is anyone else ever just so facinated with how real and detailed life is? Like, just out of nowhere you're all ""wow so intricate how does it do this, so amazing"" 
Even though you've seen it your entire life, it's just this sudden rush of love and appreciation for how beautiful our world and existance is.
I love how every single thing is so different! 
Life is so beautiful <3"
5497,isfp,"My brother-in-law (28 years old) has had a string of jobs he has hated. He's seemed to make a number of big, positive changes in his outlook on life recently, and part of that was the recent realization that he wants to find a career that really suits him. 
Any suggestions?"
5498,isfp,"Anything that capitalizes on our natural creative ability is keyyyyy! Things like graphic design, painting, interior decorating, yada yada yada. And also allows us to have a semi-flexible schedule and lots of independence.
~Or~ anything to do with child care (except social work- it would stress us the fluck out) or animal care 
I think our personality would do well in the medical field as long as it is not a stressful environment. Actually any job that has a stressful environment is not suited for us in the long run. Just not worth it. Most of us are very stress prone and do not function well under high pressure (I could be speaking for myself here I don't know).
This is organized and not very well thought out (like me) but I hope it was a little helpful! "
5499,isfp,"I think statistically ISFPs have high job satisfaction.
I know of one who's happily been in the same job for most of her adult life. She's an art technician at a primary school in the UK and gets equal parts introvert time and extrovert time, depending on the time of year. She gets to make things, help others, and talk to herself in her own space. She loves her job. When school is out over the summer, she's really excited by the freedom, but by the end, she wants to go back."
5500,isfp,"Yes, everything you've said is pretty accurate. Still a student right now, but I'm hoping to have a career working with animals. Though I love art, I wouldn't want my income to depend on my creativity lol, I prefer keeping it as a hobby. But who knows, that could change. I could definitely see other ISFPs loving artistic careers.
I've always found a lot of honour in jobs to do with healing, but I wouldn't want to be a doctor or surgeon precisely because it's way too stressful (and way too much school). 
I could see us possibly becoming good in stressful situations, but Te would have to be developed for sure :)"
5501,isfp,"I am an isfp girl. A year ago I tried to confess to my crush through WhatsApp and he thought it was a dare. then I was too nervous that I changed the topic. actually I knew it was not going to work but I tried anyway. this confession was the last straw before ending the friendship and my feelings towards him. at the end nothing happened and I gave up. :( 
heres the question: do you isfps confess your feelings or do you bottle them up and observe?"
5502,isfp,"i'm a girl & you know - the social norm is that guys are supposed to make the first move, which is crazy and a whole other topic itself.. but putting all things aside... generally i just bottle up and observe, i don't usually say anything unless i have a feeling that it's mutual (not that i've even ever truly confessed anyways...) .
but really, that's me with every relationship whether it's platonic or romantic. i don't really put myself out there unless i can kinda sense that the other person wants the same thing as i do. and even then i would be hesitant to do anything about it.. but when i do, things are usually just more on the subtle side, haha."
5503,isfp,"I've bottled up feelings and I've let them flow
In the end you won't know if feelings are mutual without asking.
If you think you feel good about someone it won't hurt (long) to ask.
People usually won't hurt your honest feelings and if they did you know right away you'd be better off alone or someone else.
Your feelings come from thinking about him or her and if they haven't thought about you like you have thought about them then there's only one way to get them thinking like you.
Bottled up feelings only hurt or please you, nobody else.
Sharing them includes others.
Follow your heart with a hint of thought."
5504,isfp,"I don't bottle it up lol. I wait it out, keep meeting new people, let go of attachment, keep trying to meet them if they like hanging out with me, keep flirting, keep it light and friendly, if they show any signs of interest, I move in, if not, I just enjoy the time with them for what it is."
5505,isfp,"I'm no expert on this, but depends on how long. If you know them a decint amount then tell them, but in person. Always in person!!! It makes it more genuine. I am guy and I like when girls make a move. I find I've shot myself in the foot by waiting. I'm not great at it, but it's better to try and miss than never take a shot. I regret not doing far more. Remember it is at the worst practice. "
5506,isfp,"Bottle them up. Unless I know for sure that the feelings are mutual. Except I remember one year, now that I look back on it, this guy was being very obvious that he liked me and I was torturing myself trying to figure out if he had a crush on me. He ended up losing interest and so did I. Don‚Äôt do what I did. "
5507,isfp,"I'm too shy to make a move directly, but if I'm really into that person I try to take a chance, even if it's asking a mutual friend if they seem interested or not. Whatever works for you. Also, passion (being ""in love"") isn't a very healthy thing for me, it usually happens when I'm idealizing someone, not seeing them for who they really are. Real love is being partners, building something together, and that's more important than random unrequited crushes"
5508,isfp,"I do the same, let things flow before even thinking about anything. Let it be what it is suposed to. I say this but really, when i get intimacy with a girl, i fall in love almost 100% of the times. It sucks."
5509,isfp,"I've been there. But now I've been with the same girl for nearly two years. The mistakes we've made don't change our chances.
Before you fall for one of those girls again, think about whether or not you're willing to spend your entire life with them. That's a huge deal. From my experience, coming to that conclusion is the result of finding true love which is well developed and 100% mutual. You and I are still more likely to fall in love first though, so whatever you do, just play things smooth.
You and I love to love, it's as simple as that. But it blinds us from the big picture. When you find it, the future will become clear. Until then, be very cautious."
5510,isfp,"So I thought maybe posting this here would be the best place. I'm an 21F ISFP-T and I'm struggling with some identity issues as I'm a rising senior in college. Mostly this is arising because I want to start a YouTube channel (which is something I've wanted for a number of years). I just don't feel like I really know who I am enough to know exactly what content I should produce. 
To give you an idea of why I want to get started with YouTube, I love producing and editing videos. I don't think anything makes me feel more creatively stimulated since I'm not much of a drawing / painting type of creative haha. I also love the freedom that it would give me. Even if I don't go extremely far to make it a job, it's still so open ended that I could make whatever I wanted / follow whatever schedule I liked. 
BUT despite all that I don't feel like I'm a person who is interesting enough / I'm having a lot of doubt about my abilities both in making videos and in finding a job / career path that interests me enough. 
I've heard that isfps tend to go through experimental phases wifh their lives and identies more than other personality types but I just wish I could understand better what I want out of life and who I really want to be. One day I will want one thing and the next I want something else it seems. 
Thanks for reading. I'd like to know if you experienced something similar and how you could overcome these feelings of being lost with your identity."
5511,isfp,"I fight with the same thing. I actually love producing music videos and nothing makes me feel as creatively alive. Literally I can spend an entire day shooting video of the city on my dslr, editing the video and matching it to music with effects and shit. It's such an emotionally involving experience too, like I will completely isolate myself from family and friends and act a little closed off to them when I'm in a creative flow state. Unfortunately, I really don't like the person I become from a social or ethical standpoint when I'm in that zone. Also, it's not a very marketable skill and I also want to a solid income to support my family and do fun things with them so I've chosen a more stable corporate job.
The thing that helps me the most is realizing that submitting to temperamental weaknesses is not helpful for any personality type. Stop thinking that being an ""ISFP"" (which literally means that in your default state, you're more likely to act with ISFP tendencies) is limiting you from doing what you want. Even being part of this forum can be a circle jerk of people becoming demotivated to try anything ""non-ISFP"" like because we think that we should just live comfortably and not push ourselves towards any kind of goal that's important to us. 
Listen dude, not trying to be condescending or harsh (I almost feel like I'm negotiating with my best and worst self here a little too) but YOU KNOW what you want in life. You look up to people, and resent others, and there is an ideal version of person that you want to be. There's an ideal way you want to be around people, the influence you want to have on them, the feeling your profession gives you, the amount of love you want to feel, the relationship you want to have with nature, how you want people to view you, etc. While it's hard to linguistically articulate these ideals, especially as an ISFP, they need to be recognized. 
Tl;dr, you have an idea what you want. Don't let being an ISFP stop you. "
5512,isfp,"Identity, what's that? For real, I've never seen the idea of having an identity as nothing but self-limiting. Sure, it gives a sense of security knowing you're that and that, but it comes with a price."
5513,isfp,"I get you. When I was a teen people would always say stuff like 'just be yourself' and I would always think 'but I don't know who I am'. You said that you loved the freedom editing gives you, so shouldn't that be enough? Isn't that something that makes you an individual?"
5514,isfp,"so like 75% of posts on /r/isfp are relationships advice etc. (the other 25% being everyone's surveys). so I want to reach out to all those isfp's that haven't been in a relationship/don't want to be in one/ have other reasons. So just a roll call, maybe give some background about you, and discussion, hopefully"
5515,isfp,"Never have, but would like to. It can get lonely being around the same family members 24/7 and speaking to the same one friend every few days. It would be nice to have someone else to talk to and share real experiences with."
5516,isfp,"New relationships honestly feel like they become the new meaning of my life.  I meet a new girl and immediately think about how great we'd be together.  I begin crafting a sort of timeline from before we even begin to become friends.  I didn't feel like this until I experienced my first relationship where I had someone so close and important to me.  I felt like I had finally opened my eyes to the world.  After it ended I seemingly began to search for those same feelings from every girl I ever come in contact with.  It sort of scares me, so I have tried to just become another face in the crowd since my last one. 
All I can say is that I hope that one day I can happen across the ""right person"" again while not making everyone really creeped out in the process lol."
5517,isfp,"I never have and I really have no desire to. it's seem like way too much work to me, even just to even meet people. I never feel lonely so I don't really feel the need to try lol. i kinda like only worrying about myself but then again idk the alternative"
5518,isfp,"I'm just at the age where being in a relationship starts to be ok and there's only one thing I want: cuddles, so so many cuddles, but ppl don't like me in general and nobody to cuddle with :(. The last time I remember cuddling was with my mom, years ago. I have this big bear that I sleep with (shut up) and hug at night. Like, my going-to-sleep pose is me hugging him. I want hugs and cuddles :("
5519,isfp,"I'm 19 and I haven't had a relationship yet. (I think that's pretty normal at that age? Lol.) I think it's mostly because I'm a homebody and don't really go out. Also our town is pretty small so it's not like I meet that many interesting people anyway. I think I'd be more active seeking out a relationship after I've moved out (which hopefully happens soon). Anyway, relationships aren't something to stress about for me. I can easily enjoy being single in the present while dreaming about a relationship in the future."
5520,isfp,"(i forgot to comment myslf) 
male - I've never been in a relationship, although I have been seeked out twice to be dated. both times I just did nothing because I'm so awkward and the first time, I was not ready for the person who wanted to date me, that same person didn't even know what they wanted out of a relationship,  looking back now.
the second time was from someone I kinda knew, but was way out of my small social circle and was so different from me. they were very talkative and had a good personality, whereas I have a quite deadpan personality which is hit or miss.
looking into the future,  I would go out of my way to date someone unless I felt very strongly about them, but I would still struggle. something would have to fall into my lap for me to date someone,  I'm not really hard pressed to date someone like I was when I was a teenager. so ya, that's it for me"
5521,isfp,"25 and never have. i feel like it's really difficult to find someone that i wanna spend all my time with. the few times i've come close to it things just kinda fizzled out and i really didn't bother doing anything about that. never had a real urge to be in a relationship either.
also there's someone who's into me now except i don't feel the same. on the other hand there's someone i like and probably would consider dating but we've not made it very far (just a few dinners) and nothing has happened for a while and i don't feel like i care enough to make something happen.
sometimes it feels like there's something wrong with me maybe? "
5522,isfp,"21 male, I've never been in a relationship. I would like to be in one but I don't know how it works and am scared of new things. I also feel too broken and messed up from being a child abuse victim and having depression and anxiety and ADHD-innatentive and have some self hate issues and don't think anyone would ever want me or that I deserve a good relationship with another person. In high school I asked a few girls out but didn't do a lot of legwork and got denied overtime and haven't asked since then. I'm also a bigger gut 6'3"" 270 and have recently lost 80 pounds and will try to continue but have some hangups and think that being overweight also makes me undatable and contributes to the self hate no one wanting me thing. I feel like I would hurt them just because they would be around me and I'm sad and tired a lot and am working hard to just get by with the depression. "
5523,isfp,"Male, 25+, longest relationship lasted close to 2 years but it wasn't a very good one. We weren't friends and communicated poorly, which meant we never really talked to each other. Stayed for the constant physical and emotional confirmation but I wasn't really happy. I was betrayed and haven't sought anything out since then.
I show affection through touch more so than with words. Not having someone to caress or to be caressed by is something I miss dearly. Never been on a date and it'll still be a good while before I get myself out there. To start going out when you're old and supposed to know how to do the dating-thing probably isn't all that attractive, especially when you lack a fair bit of social intelligence and have a hard time opening up to even those who are closest to you.
Start young. Have fun. Just do it."
5524,isfp,"19/F NOPE, don't plan on getting married either. (mostly because people keep telling me ""you'll change your mind one day!"" NO. NO I WILL NOT. also because i don't want all my hard work going to waste just to be some house-wife :/) "
5525,isfp,"Accurate. If I went out with the intention of finding emotional/physical intimacy, then I may just be finding someone for the sake of filling a relationship, rather than finding a good match. I've seen a lot of relationships with mis-matches and one or both of the partners usually seem like they want to kill themselves. Yet they stay together for a long time because of either love, good sex, or a thoroughly engrained habit of co-dependency developed over their time together. 
My current girlfriend and I met through friends and I never saw it coming or expected to meet her. That's the way I prefer it :)"
5526,isfp,"I feel as though up until recently I've been kind of repressing/hiding my fashion consciousness because fashion always seemed like kind of feminine and girly concept.  But I think most of us would agree that the ISFP is very conscious of his/her fashion choices, so have any of you guys had a similar experience with this?"
5527,isfp,"Yes.
I know what looks good. I like looking good. But god forbid I be perceived as feminine. 
I also think part of it is my body image issues, but I'm getting over that, and I'm doing things I like now. I normally have my nails did and my makeup did and my hair.. well, sometimes I brush it(it's short! T_T) and I've actually started wearing girl clothes now. It's weird, but I kinda like it. I look sexay.
I think it's part of that love of aesthetics, so we can look very attractive - but we risk having all the attention, so it's easier to just throw something on instead of putting the effort in and risking the awkwardness that is actually talking to people. "
5528,isfp,"I have my pulse on the trends, and from there I pick and choose what would look good on me, appropriating things when I feel they don't upset a balance between form, functionality, cost and comfort. I don't desire to look flashy and I wouldn't ever want to adhere to a trend for the sake of it. At home, forget it. Two-sizes-too-big wifebeater and shorts.
There's also my tendency to draw upon vintage aesthetics..."
5529,isfp,"I think somewhere around -5 
I've been getting better, mostly because my fiance makes me want to be better overall :) 
Been working out, slowly acquiring a new wardrobe. I think just being conscious about it at all is helpful. For most of my life I just threw on whatever was on top of the drawer, now (at least sometimes) I find myself digging around a bit to find exactly what I'm looking for."
5530,isfp,"Ehh I have some I guess. I feel fairly 'in touch' with my feminine side and I used to get called ""gay"", ""faggot"", ect a lot. But I've since then stopped socializing with the guys who did that because I realized they're obviously repressed assholes.
I guess I have a decent fashion sense, at least in a subjective manner. Even if I'm at home I'll only wear things that match and look good. "
5531,isfp,"This post makes me want to retest, if it's supposedly typical of ISFP.
Not only do I not place importance on fashion, I almost struggle to understand why anyone does.  The very concept seems superficial and shallow to me.
My sense of fashion extends to trying not to dress like a slob or like someone from 30 years ago.  Beyond that I really don't care..."
5532,isfp,"It's interesting that you say that, because I've only been noticing it recently. I've always just been throwing on whatever is clean at the moment, but lately I've been paying more attention to it. I still usually wear whatever, but there are one or two specific combinations that I choose whenever I want to make a good impression.
I hate buying clothes, but as I make myself do so more and more, I'm being far more careful about what I choose. I'm wondering how that's going to develop in the future."
5533,isfp,"Well in this case, I meant fashion as a means of self expression, ignoring the trend aspect of it.  It could be that you don't consciously make wardrobe choices, but it's still there, making you feel uncomfortable if you've chosen something that isn't 'like you' to wear and vice versa?"
5534,isfp,"Ah yes there is that I see your point!
I remember wearing an outfit when my wife and I first met that was what I thought she wanted me to wear.  No big deal, nothing that would stick out in a crowd - but I fully felt like I was wearing a costume.  
It was so thoroughly ""not me"" that I was uncomfortable the entire time I had it on, even though it was a totally reasonable outfit..."
5535,isfp,"i wouldn't say i 'like' to follow a routine but i DO make up a list of things i need to do in my mind - to make up for being disorganized. because otherwise i won't get anything useful done. i'll just procrastinate (and i still do even with a list in mind). but to answer from what i feel like inside, i feel quite held back when i need to follow a routine/list/etc. so no i don't really like to follow a routine!"
5536,isfp,"If routine means getting up from bed, brushing your teeth, eating breakfast, going to school, procrastinating on homework, doing said homework late at night, and staring at the clock until midnight, then yes, I do follow a routine.
If you mean a reasonable routine, then I'm not the right person to follow."
5537,isfp,"That is me. 
I check my routine and say ""lol fuck that"" and regret later in the day. 
Still I accomplish 10% of what's in my routine and to-do list so it's better than nothing."
5538,isfp,"Yes! I figure if I write down ten things and do one of them, at least that's one thing done haha. And another reason I write all those lists is so I don't forget things, like if there is a task with an actual deadline then at least I'll be able to do it at the last second instead of forgetting it entirely."
5539,isfp,"If I flirt, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm doing it by accident. And I‚Äôm totally with you on that last part. My fianc√©e was the one who initiated our first few conversations, I wasn‚Äôt picking up the hint she wanted to date me (I also had a roommate that picked up on it and thought it was directed at him, because he was there every time we spoke), so she said screw it and texted me asking if I wanted to go to her place for dinner. She made some Alaskan Salmon, and I brought over broiled potatoes. The rest is history.
There was a time that I was a bit more confident and actually asked some girls out on dates, but I was terrified the entire time. I‚Äôd say continue to build up the courage to ask someone out and don‚Äôt over analyze the situation. It‚Äôs never as bad as you think it will be. "
5540,isfp,"I suck at flirting. When I was single I was just more nice and giving to the person of interest. Later, after dating someone else I told a few of them that yeah I flirted with them. They responded that they had no idea. They thought I was just really nice. It sucked."
5541,isfp,"I am confident enough to freely flirt with people I don't see in that perspective, but I don't really mind it and nor do they. As for looking for a suitor...I seem to forget all tactics and the meaning of the word ""chill"", I turn into this awkward goofy weird ball of confusion.... So I guess you can say I can relate."
5542,isfp,"The not approaching part could be just Fi
Quoting Jung: ‚Äúa dominant or auxiliary user of Fi can be quite reluctant to share their values, or be indifferent towards causes that are of no interest to the Fi user‚Äù"
5543,isfp,"I would a million times over recommend it to someone if they thought they needed it. Mental health is crucial, I've seen how it can break apart families and break apart people.  I went myself for a few months, and it definitely helped at the time."
5544,isfp,"i do go to one, and i would say that it's been very helpful. i started going during a rough period in my life and it really helped me get to a much better place. now i go less frequently and use it as a space to work through any difficulties that i've been facing"
5545,isfp,"I have! I would recommend it regardless whether one is an isfp or not. Mental health treatment is important to keeping you happy and healthy. I admit I was very skeptical of therapy when I first started, and my first few encounters with a therapist didn't seem helpful to me at all. But you either persist or switch to someone else as everyone is different in their style. I personally found that talk therapy is more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy, so it's just a matter of finding the right person for you. Therapy is a 2-way relationship between the therapist and client, so don't be discouraged if it doesn't seem to work out the first time."
5546,isfp,"I hated therapy. I am deeply uncomfortable being vulnerable, especially to someone I barely know. It honestly just stressed me out more haha..but might depend on what kind of issues you are dealing with"
5547,isfp,Anyone else feel like socializing is a pain in the ass especially when you are FORCED to talk about topics you either have no idea about or no interest in ? Even tryna fake that you are interested in the conversation doesn't go well cause you end making yourself looking real obvious that you don't want this conversation to continue. And then the will to socialize goes down even more. 
5548,isfp,"Think of it as an anthropology or ethnography experiment; that helps me. For example, think, ""Hmmm, it is interesting what these people I'm talking to are doing right now. It is interesting how much they like sports ball game and know how to talk so much about it."""
5549,isfp,"Everryyy time. It's really hard for me to talk to people because when I'm having a ""natural conversation"" I'm all over the place and that tends to weird people out. I also feel like my brain goes the opposite direction as normal people and when I do talk people don't understand why I'm saying what I'm saying. Communication is not my strong suit lol. But I have no problem listening to people. Most of my friends have been people who just want a person to listen to them babble on lol. I don't mind but it would be nice if those people tried listening/understanding to me when I talk. "
5550,isfp,"What helped me is seeing it as showing interest in the person, not the topic of the conversation. That helps me a lot in one on one conversations and small groups although I often still check out in larger groups when the conversation becomes impersonal... still working on that.
Honestly, trying to be more social is the hardest, most nerve wrecking thing I've ever tried. I go back and forth between ""You can do it!"" and ""I'm moving to a lonely island so I don't ever have to interact with anyone ever again!"". I really admire the ENFJs out there; it seems like genuine interest in other people comes so naturally to them..."
5551,isfp,"The present is a gift, and it brings happiness. If we focus on the past or future too much, we miss it. This has made me wonder...
What's a healthy amount of present-orientedness for each type? Are some personality types destined to be happier than others? When should we focus on the present? If life is about the journey, not the destination, are some types destined to miss out on life?"
5552,isfp,"Leading questions! And yes to all!
Happiest types are Ne and Se users. Se users are happiest living in the present. Technically I ought to be missing out on life, because I‚Äôm so future oriented -but strangely enough, I don‚Äôt care. The present is not a happy place for me. It‚Äôs a dangerous, nerve-wracking place, full of stuff that can go wrong if I take one wrong step. I‚Äôm happiest living in the future, and my present is bearable, because I planned my way here.
By the same logic, I‚Äôd say Si users are happier living in the past, but don‚Äôt take that from me.
Edit: You forgot one more -Ne users live in multiple dimensions XD"
5553,isfp,"As INFP, I feel other INFPs tend to be boring on first impression?  I kick myself for not picking up clues I didn't expect,
ISFP's generally intimidate me because they seem perhaps focused, but intensely real.  ISFP's are hardcore.  Like no bullshit vibe but no fucking around vibe either.  "
5554,isfp,"Finding your own type in another person is really difficult, but that happens with all 16 types. 
Also when people that has the same type interact with each other it's really awkward because unconsciously you're trying to match a bit that person's personality (this happens to all humans in order to have a conversation), and your brain interprets that they must be another type, because they're not you.
Just my 2 cents, I think human interaction is the culprit here!"
5555,isfp,"I think they‚Äôre pretty obvious to me. I know one: He‚Äôs really laid back and quiet while at the same time has this kind of intense and action oriented vibe. And you can clearly see the Fi and Se but Fi is dominating it. 
wish it was that easy to type myself hnnnnnggggggg"
5556,isfp,"ISFPs- I find them not as common as other S-types. They are the most introverted of all peoples. If someone is the quietest in the group, it is probably an ISXP. Prefers action over words. Would rather walk across the room and pick something up, than ask someone to pass it to them. Would rather put their hand on your shoulder than say, ‚ÄòI love you.‚Äô Will not initiate conversation. Will not initiate anything. You can spot the ISFP from noticing the silence/empty space, rather than trying to find the ISFP."
5557,isfp,"This is really inacurate 
My dad and I are both isfp and communicate with people without hesitation if needed/wanted
Dad works in medical and I work as a courtesy clerk
You can have 100 gallons of ""social fuel"" and get good at talking to people then use much less ""social fuel"" if any in some cases. While another person would not be as efficient and requiring more alone time.
Whatever trait you focus on you will get better at. These stereotypes can be fun but apart from typing freshman in high school they have no real world application."

5559,isfp,"Same reason here. Its just really nice to lurk the subreddit and be like ""I feel at home"". Before I found out that I was an ISFP I would be trying hard to identifiy with other types but being on here I know its just right"
5560,isfp,"I like being able to relate to others, and the sub is very welcoming:). Also, I know this is silly since it is technically an MBTI sub, but I appreciate that a lot of the posts have nothing to do with Myers Briggs, and its just ISFPs sharing little parts of their lives! Its just like-minded people talking about whatever, and I think that's pretty cool:)."
5561,isfp,"I want to discover myself through the others that know themselves. I've been really reading into my type and doubting it because I don't relate to many of the attributes of an isfp. That being said, I've been trying to push myself into these stereotypes and hoping something I haven't tried yet just clicks. "
5562,isfp,"I think if I drew him he might look a bit different with my art style. I'll probably give it a shot one of these days when I have time.

5563,isfp,"Yes indeed it is! I wasn't into anime much, lots of people reccomemded me to watch boku no hero a year or two ago and it made me like anime! It was my first and one of my favourite I've watched so far. "
5564,isfp,"Welcome to the community, take a look at r/animemes to get some good recomendations (they are mostly memes) and make some idea of what genre you like. You can start with some shonen or seinen like one punch man :) "
5565,isfp,"Haha I've watched quite a few:
BKNHA
Death Note
AoT S1
One Punch Man
Mob Phsycho
Clannad
FMA Brotherhood (my favourite so far)
Spirited Away
A Silent Voice
Naruto
Probably a few more but I don't remember. 
Currently watching:
Steins Gate
Seven Deadly Sins
Mob Phsyco S2
Naruto Shippuden
Ive been barely watching anime recently tho, I wanna start cause whenever I watch anime it motivates me to exercise haha
What anime do you like? "
5566,isfp,"Hmm, i strongly recommend Jojos bizarre adventure(if you watch at least the first 3 parts you will love this series and community) , nichijou, absolute duo, tate no yusha, tensei shitara slime, majutsu no index, radiant, and danshi kokousei no nichijo, some of them i've watched twice"
5567,isfp,"Does anyone else notice a bias against sensors? Most mbti descriptions sound like they were written by intuitive types who don't really understand how sensors think, and portray us as the less intelligent types. Many people don't seem to understand that N and S signify how you think, not how smart you are. Many intuitive types on mbti forums seem to have this bias too. I'm probably going to get downvoted a lot because the majority of users on reddit are probably N types (I think many of them mistyped themselves though), but it's something I want to talk about so I don't really care. 
edit: I was actually going to delete this post right after I wrote it but I'm glad I didn't. Thanks for the discussion. :)"
5568,isfp,"Oh absolutely.  The amount of times I've seen ""DAE sensors are dumb????"" in MBTI communities is downright ridiculous.  I don't understand why the bias even exists.  When I first got involved in MBTI I thought there would be more so a bias towards introverts over extroverts, and maybe a bias towards thinkers over feelers.  It's not that these biases don't exist to a certain extent, but the bias towards Ns is so much more pronounced.    
Edit:  Another thing that makes me lol every time I see it come up, is when someone posts something like ""I'm the only intuitive I know, and I'm surrounded by sensors.  It's a living hell"".  "
5569,isfp,"Oh, definitely. I've come to totally disregard those online quizzes because they're just so poorly written and yes, very biased toward intuitives. Dumb questions like ""do you prefer small talk or discussing ~deep~ things?"" One, why not both? Two, freaking everyone thinks they're deep, special, smart, everything the tests all but come out and say intuitives are. So really, no surprise everyone and their mom proudly claims to be an INxJ, the supposedly rarest types (which adds another layer to the special snowflake factor, I think).
I advise people all the time to ignore the tests and just study the functions. They can be difficult, yes, but that's the accurate way to find your type. 
Buuuuut no, it's not about understanding themselves or other people. Most just want a special personality type as an ego boost."
5570,isfp,"I've noticed it on Reddit and many of the typing quizzes/tests, but not elsewhere. I don't get how intuitives get steretyped as smart and sensors as dumb. It makes zero sense and if anything I would think it would be the opposite, or most likely balanced. I would think the intelligence stereotype would be a thinker bias over feelers, yet oddly enough I haven't seen that."
5571,isfp,"I agree.  I think the way these descriptions get written make people mistype themselves a lot since being intuitive just sounds better.  It doesn't directly bother me that much (I haven't had anyone on any forum be weird at me for being a sensor - that just sounds rude) but it does bug me when people use it as an ego thing.  Your MBTI type seems to be a weird thing to be proud about.
That said, you're in an ISFP forum. I'm not sure why you think you'd be downvoted."
5572,isfp,"INFP here, I do have a bit of a bias aganst sensors which is absolutely unfair. I agree with everything you have said. I just built the bias due to bad experiences and really frustrating conversations, I am trying to keep an open mind and identify the bias when it comes up.  "
5573,isfp,"INFP checking in...
This post really made me think.
Being honest, I wasn't aware that I looked down on sensors intellectually, until now.
Being honest again, I don't generally like the way sensors present perspectives and information, which is what I have an insatiable appetite for. 
However, that has been changing, since I've become more interested in developing skills in art, I find the way sensors describe the creative process captivating, insightful and inspiring. I am envious of the pre-disposition to which sensors have towards creative and physical expression.
When talking to sensory in my family, it's like we are talking another language to one another, they seem puzzled by my inability to adopt their focus.
I have noticed relatively recently though, after trying to reengage mindfulness, that there is an ocean of subtly and wisdom that can only come from centering in somatic experience, and the input of the senses. And sensors have a huge advantage when it comes to developing that, which is taking me a long time to develop.
Also, sensors seem to have a far better advantage when it comes to developing sports and artistic skills. "
5574,isfp,I think it's interesting that you say that. The one is more concerned with the result and the other are more concerned with the procedure. That's the difference between the two types. They both get results. One is more methodical maybe. How does it get seen as smarter?
5575,isfp,"I agree with this so much. Just recently I saw a post about ""butt hurt"" sensors who complain over a system that isn't backed up by actual science. I think it's more obnoxious to use a system not backed up by actual science to step on people you don't even know. "
5576,isfp,"Yes, I find it hard to believe so many people use Ni as their dominant function. I wish people would look at cognitive functions more closely too, instead of generalizing and saying vague stuff like, ""well, they're creative"" or ""they're smart so they must be an N-type"". I feel like the same people who mistype themselves also mistype their favorite fictional characters (Daenerys as INFJ(more ENFJ), Temperance Brennan as INTJ(more ISTJ), Naruto as ENFP(more ESFP)) to relate to them more. "
5577,isfp,"There is SO MUCH bias against sensors on sites like personalitycafe and typologycentral. Like ShyDude1986 said, some people openly say sensors are stupid, but usually they do it more subtly to not seem like an asshole. Their careful phrasing just makes them sound patronizing imo. "
5578,isfp,"I was afraid because I notice a lot of N-types like to lurk in other mbti forums, and because they outnumber sensors so much here. I think there was a post a few days ago that was basically a count of all the mbti types, and the N-types outnumbered the S-types 4 times more. "
5579,isfp,I appreciate that. My INFP sister grew up with our very dominating ESXJ mom and always felt misunderstood. At least you are trying to keep an open mind though! What's funny is that she gets along better with her than I do now. 
5580,isfp,"This really speaks a lot to me. Reminds me of how picky I get with certain lines and composition in my art, because each line encourages a different emotion. Reminds me of that Ted Talk about how the speaker experienced each number as an emotion and life of its own. "
5581,isfp,"What do you mean by ""have your happy time in mbti""? I can't tell if you're offended because this is typed...
But I hope you're not offended. I don't think all n-types think this. I'm just saying see a lot of them write stuff like this.
Could you tell me how you witness favoritism towards sensors in the art industry? Curious because I'm also in the art industry."
5582,isfp,"Sensors generally liking sports more than intuitives isn't a ""bias"", it's a preference (and one many of us do not share anyway), while people online (ALWAYS in my experience, people who mistype themselves as intuitives because they think it sounds better than being a sensor) outright say sensors are inferior, stupid, small minded, useless, a bunch of drones, etc. It's no wonder everyone and their mom wants to be an INFJ/INTJ/INFP because the poorly written quizzes make them sound like amazing snowflakes out spouting philosophy next to the sensors who only care about sports and dinner.
Also, if we're gonna stereotype here, art is generally a sensor thing.  üòé"
5583,isfp,"What do you mean by ""have your happy time in mbti""? I can't tell if you're offended because this is typed...
But I hope you're not offended. I don't think all n-types think this. I'm just saying see a lot of them write stuff like this.
Could you tell me how you witness favoritism towards sensors in the art industry? Curious because I'm also in the art industry."
5584,isfp,"Yeah a lot of my family is sensor type (at least i suspect) and i have gotten a lot of ""oh dont feel that way"" and a lot of stubbornness to new ideas as well as just a lack of emotional depth sometimes. No one was ever willing to dig in and try to see how i felt. It was a lot of ""this is what i think and that is how it will be"". But yeah i need to work on that bias "
5585,isfp,"Ah .. not offended. I was tired when I wrote that, so finesse not working. What I meant by 'happy time' was getting to feel special in the MBTI community, because I certainly don't in the art community. Not that people have been biased against me in places like Deviant Art or my workplace. I work in animation, and SPs are some of the most accepting people I know, what I mean by 'bias' is that there is a bigger proportion of SPs in art compared to in MBTI -and I can't help but feel inferior when I compare my art to theirs, and see the natural ease with which they breeze through their work -I certainly don't have that. But in MBTI, I am the majority instead of the exception, and I can relate to others with ease, and I don't feel like I need to struggle to prove myself to others."
5586,isfp,"I know I try to understand my sister :) and I've had both n-types and s-types tell me not to feel a certain way. What you described sounds like my mother talking to me and my sister. In fact, they both tell I'm too sensitive a lot. 
I don't think those kind of people are all s-types (not all s-types have little emotional depth or little openness to new ideas), they're just self-righteous people in general...but yeah I hate it when people do that to me too.
Curious, what types are in your family? "
5587,isfp,"Oh-- I thought you meant that they were biased because your thought process was different, not because we outnumber the Ns in the art industry (but perhaps we don't?). I think we artists  always think we are worst than others. As a isfp artist (fitting the stereotype) I can tell you I don't breeze through it. I get caught up sooooo much with everything. And when I was little, my infp sister was always better with line, proportion, form, etc. and I was always just better at color and value. And I still struggle trying to prove myself to others ;)"
5588,isfp,"My INFJ sister told me I'm too sensitive! Don't let them change you, you seem like a really cool person and that would be a shame if the world lost that. 
You are right that some people are self righteous and close minded and they don't have to be s types.
My family is: mom is ISFJ, dad is a management type (ESTJ or something like that I am not sure), sister is INFJ, I think my aunt is ISTJ (I think), one of my uncles is ESTP for sure but never made him take the test. I will admit I really don't know too many of their types. I just don't get along with them, I always feel very judged and that I don't have much common ground with them except for a select few. What about your family?"
5589,isfp,"Aw thank you! U.U
My sister is infp, mom is esxj (probably estj), grandma is esfj?, dad is infp. 
I wonder why that is. Do they judge how you do things, say you have slow reactions, focus on stuff that don't matter? My estj mom does that to me a lot. Used to do that to my sister as well. I feel like she values getting stuff done more than Fi stuff like talking about feelings and personal values. Esfj grandma was always looking at hierarchy and wanted us to listen to her, but could be petty too. My mom actually understands me pretty well though, because we started out with good relations and still talk a lot. My dad doesn't understand me and I don't understand him though. We don't talk a lot. I think its mostly about communication and how open people are, though older family members may be dismissive in general because they think they know better than you, or don't realize how much they hurt you."
5590,isfp,"They judge how we do things and are so unaccepting of new ideas. Like an example is my sister had a conversation about religion with my aunt. My sister and I are not religious but if others are we are ok with that. But my aunt is a bit... zealous. She asked my sister ""but how will you teach your children to be good people without religion?""
Another example is my mom who is kinda against different ways of life, she has said things that really give me the impression of ""get a boring job"". She said that it's a bad idea of being an artist because you will never earn money that way. Not that I want to be an artist but still gives me the impression of disapproval of anything that would be not a regular job.
Lastly, this one I dispise to mention but whatever, my dad is really judgemental and racist (my mom to an extent as well). My dad has said ""black people are so lazy, there's a reason they all do drugs and so many are in jail"". Yeah.... yeah. 
It's those kinds of things that really turn me away and I lose all interest in talking to them. "
5591,isfp,"I'm sorry-- I didn't find the time to sit down and reply til now.
But wow. I have those exact same experiences with my older family members. You know what's funny? I wanted to go into the art field (graphic design) since I was little. I went to middle school and high school with art majors with my mom's support. In my junior year, I... lost her support. She began saying the most hurtful things to me about my dreams. I don't think she knows how much she hurt me still. My whole family says racist and homophobic stuff all the time. And I argue so much with them over that. I think the main issue is generational and cultural. They grew up in different times and aren't willing to change their views. I doubt it has anything to do with type though. My N dad and S mom both say racist and homophobic things. Doesn't mean they don't care about you and love you. But I get it's hard to live with that sometimes. Just because they're older and have more experience doesn't mean they're always right!"
5592,isfp,"I know I keep saying this but I agree with everything you said. It's really sad that you lost your mom's support, I hope that doesn't stop you from doing what makes you happy. I do also agree that the issue is probably generational, a lot of my family fall back on very traditional ideas which gets frustrating very quickly. The reasons I don't get along with them are for other reasons which are more specific that don't have to do with types. 
This is one thing that bothers me about people in general (not referring to S types). I immediately get turned off from a person who refuses to even consider another perspective, I know that some people grow up and learn concepts that they stick with. I just refuse to believe that once you pass a certain age that everything is set in stone, is it that hard to say ""hmm maybe you're right let me think about that."" "
5593,isfp,"It was hard but I convinced her to accept I would pursue it. I tried other majors, and I was just too unhappy to continue. I have a job in my preferred field now but I still worry because I know my field isn't stable. I was lucky:) I remember she doubted me a lot when I was still looking though. 
You know what? There are so many people like that. I know my mom doesn't like to think about other different viewpoints because she thinks it's a waste of her time if there's no practical value (not all s-types are like this and the value in this, which she couldn't see, is developing a deeper bond with us). She doesn't listen to me nor my sister when we talk about how we were hurt by some of her actions. She's very self-righteous. I imagine for many people, it is the same thing. Self righteousness and apathy/laziness. Especially online, people prefer flinging poo over having a logical debate, because if they don't care for the person, why care about their ideals? Or, if they care about the person, why face the fact that they hurt the person? An enfp acquaintance told me that parents don't like to admit they sometimes their own kids the most. Frustrating but true. "
5594,isfp,"That frustrates me to no end, my parents are very self righteous as well. I really have no words to describe my frustration with that mindset, I mean it's SO short sighted and arrogant that I can't imagine being that kind of person. The worst part is that mindset is what leads to so many sufferings in the world, why care for anyone else except ourselves? Let the world burn while I sit in my hot tub. I just can't stand that. "
5595,isfp,"Any of you ISFPs out there play an instrument of any kind (music production included)? 
I've always felt the draw and temptation but have a hard time dedicating and committing. 
Anyone else feel this way?"
5596,isfp,"I play piano and guitar. I'm not amazing at either, it's more of a hobby for me. I did lessons on piano for several years at like an intense music school, and guitar for a bit, but I enjoy it the most when I'm just figuring it out on my own. For guitar, I tried to figure out how to play my favourite song at the time. It sounded so bad, that I just had to figure out all the intricate parts so that it sounded good, and it made me practice so much and learn a lot about guitar, hahaha."
5597,isfp,"I'm earning my master of music right now. Dedication and commitment are things I'm still thinking about, but I keep going because there's nothing else I could really do successfully, I believe. That doesn't mean it makes it easier, but I understand what you may mean."
5598,isfp,"I'm actually getting my bachelor's in vocal  music performance with an emphasis in opera! I can't imagine myself doing anything else. I love it! I also play the piano and the guitar and teach private music lessons for all three. If you're ever in central mn, let me know!"
5599,isfp,"I play piano. I have played piano since I was 3 (I'm 18), and in the last five years I have dedicated a lot of my time to it. I play a lot of classical music but I love all music so I play anything really. Music is my life. "
5600,isfp,"I play the sax and piano. A lot less now (last time was over a year ago) since 2008 and my current job giving me carpal tunnel... But I do love music. I haven't fed the passion in a long time so it kind of died out. Boy, I love being an adult."
5601,isfp,"I really like the different genres of music that feature trumpets and the possibility of being able to play that. Growing up, my family listened to a lot of Latin American music and 70's/80's funk. Later I got really into ska, reggae, big band, and jazz.
What about you?! Have you been playing long?"
5602,isfp,"I've played for nearly ten years. 
I began when I was 11 in middle school and have stayed in band since this last fall by being in my university marching band. I'm a moderately good player and have come to appreciate it as a fun hobby, not something to compete with. 
I've played so many different types of music: jazz, concert music, polkas, etc. When I play by myself I try to just think of tunes I like and figure them out. It keeps things fun and it brings me joy. "
5603,isfp,"some thoughts can flood my room so easily.
I never knew how to swim in that river.
How much is very lonely?
I dreamed that the glow of a smile will shine beyond the end of the last atom.
Sometimes I like to think that there is something that will not be swallowed by the darkness of nothing."
5604,isfp,"I noticed I rarely, if ever, daydream. It usually happens when I have a crush on someone, and that doesn't happen all the time either, though when it happens, it happens hard. But I'm still a dreamer. Just, I dream ""practically"". If I dream of doing something, I will take action towards it. I can't spend hours daydreaming like some people I know. I have to think about something that actually will lead me to a concrete thing. Does anyone else do that? I'd not be surprised if it was typical of us ISFPs to be ""practical dreamers"" rather than ""daydreamers"". "
5605,isfp,"Hey :) I usually test as INFP but I feel convinced I am ISFP, so there's the possibility that this answer isn't representative...
When I dream practically, I am considering what I want to do (usually in the moment or for a decision within three months) by envisioning the action that comes to me most naturally, without feelings of resistance. It helps me to envision going to the park, for example, before I can decide to do it.
Sometimes, like when I have a crush or am missing a significant other, and I am tired, I will daydream idly about some random situation where we are together. I am hoping that this situation plays out, but I won't take action toward it, and I can remind myself that what I am dreaming about isn't real and it's not a great idea to dwell on or trust these dreams.
Another situation I sort of daydream is when I am thinking about how others will feel about the actions I take (when I feel social pressure, I think ISFPs struggle with wanting to be loved and accepted or at least not hated). I will imagine someone else's face or a negative conversation if I am not careful. This is the most unintentional kind of daydreaming."
5606,isfp,"I would agree to an extent. I'm not saying I always take action towards the thing but when I tend to daydream and think about things that could actually happen or effect my life. For instance, daydreaming about taking a vacation with my wife somewhere. I can spend a lot of time fantasizing but it's always like 'things that I think could happen'.
This is very different to most of my friends who are intuitives (Ne) who daydream and think indepth about stuff I consider 'useless' because it has no impact on their real life, and they have no way to implement any of it in a practical way."
5607,isfp,"Ohhhh, that makes sense. I often daydream, but it's rarely ""what if"" scenarios (if it is it's either when I have a crush or something alternate-history related). Usually it's about different ways to go about doing something, what I should do to solve x, hype for y that is about to happen, etc."
5608,isfp,"Yes, i get this. I day dream about crushes, i daydream about art projects i could/should do, finishing songs and starting a band, i daydream about saying certain things to people or saying something funny and everyone laughs (yes im quite lame). Sometimes I day dream about styles i could try out, like what if i pierced my nipples or bleached my hair. Stuff like that. Yeah its always about stuff that could happen in my life. On occasions ive gotten story ideas and have daydreamed about them. But thats fairly rare."
5609,isfp,"I do the same. I could've technically been an INFP, but I feel more like I belong here. If you feel convinced like that, you probably are ISFP. Both types are quite alike, it's just a matter of functions.
I am quite sensitive to social pressure too, and I do have that thing of imagine the negative conversation as well. "
5610,isfp,"I'm kind of like that too. I only daydream ""practically"". I don't really get Ne. I can think in depth about many things, but it's always things that actually have an impact on my life, or that could actually work. There is always a ""grip"" somewhere in reality. Might be why I don't really feel at my place in INFP groups and subs, they speak a language I don't really understand."
5611,isfp,"Hey dudes! An INTP 9w8 here. Just wanted to share how my ISFP friend mistyped as an INFJ. She is an enneagram type 1w2, which is pretty common for INFJs. Type 1 generally made her appear more ‚ÄúJ‚Äù, so she never considered that she was a ‚ÄúP‚Äù type. Her tertiary Ni is somewhat developed and I would say that she often gets into loops, making her think that her Se is lower than it actually is.
Most ISFPs are enneagram types 9 and 4, and enneagram has a big impact on your personality and actions, so she doesnt at all relate to any ISFP online descriptions. After showing her the descriptions for the single functions in ISFP positions, she definately related more. She scores higher on Te in cognitive function tests, due to her enneagram type 1.
I thought it would be cool to share, and to see if any of you have a more unusual enneagram for ISFPs and how that affected the processes of discovering your MBTI type?"
5612,isfp,Seems like the isfps i know including myself have once mistyped as infjs before. People just dont do enough research and i would have carried on being infj if i didnt have a inconsistency sniffer in me. It's the first time i heard of a 1w2 isfp and wonder if she really is one? Pardon my skepticism cuz i'm a 6w5. All along i assumed i was a 4 due to my strong emotions and 4 being where most infjs collide sounds like a fail proof thing than other types besides 5s. But eventually i found my type and it sounds more apt than the 4w5 one. I have a lot of things in common with the Js more than the Ps due to enneagram but eventually my basic functions are still isfp related. And i would add that isfps who have a more developed intuition or one that didnt go deeper into mbti will type themselves as infjs. 
5613,isfp,"The enneagram is just another attempt at doing the same thing as MBTI. and it fails miserably. That's why many people fit multiple enneagram types. ( and no, it's not like ""which one you fit best"", like most people literally fit best in multiple enneagrams in any possible given order.) (which of course invalidates the tritypes and etc......)
I wouldn't advise to believe in any of that shit. "
5614,isfp,"Since I already addressed the tritypes, by ‚Äúmultiples‚Äù I mean 4 or more. I also mentioned ‚Äúat any given order‚Äù which invalidates types/tritypes because it says that it has to be in a specific order.
this will be my last comment. "
5615,isfp,"When they're playing a part and got their walls up and it's so obvious (but they think it's not) do you ever get frustrated and just rage quit? Happened with a guy I've been talking to, I just felt like he wouldn't be real with me so I said my bye byes. Suddenly he gets real asking what happened. I straight up told him I was bored. In truth I was frustrated and tired and understimulated and just not having it. Well he asked me out pretty soon after that, no more games or playing coy.
I think people really don't value each other. Just feeding each other fake bullshit to protect themselves. If there's one thing I can appreciate about ISFPs it's that we seek what's real and if it's real, we don't judge it, we respect the balls on someone who can be candid and we respect human nature. In fact without the real we wither. You can feel it in the exhaustion and frustration that seems to come from nowhere as you interact with someone. I mean when something is manufactured it isn't emotionally stimulating and we can feel it it's so transparent. How dissociated do you have to be to get used to that. We shouldn't have to get used to that lifeless bullshit nor should we waste our energy on what doesn't give us life. 
Sorry but I'm just not coping with that for anyone anymore. Life is too short to waste energy on what doesn't nourish you. If someone wants to be in your life, make sure they've earned a spot by actually being brave enough to show up with you the way you show up with them. Otherwise are they really worth your time?"
5616,isfp,"infp here-  pretty focused on authenticity too but also walled and defensive. I'll never be fake but I need to feel safe and I guess..wanted? when I'm opening up.
I have a close isfp friend I think is getting bored with my candidness though. I can't really tell, he rarely answers anything I say with something clear and meaningful. He says he appreciates honesty and realness but in the moment when I'm putting myself out there he doesn't seem to appreciate the vulnerability or that i'm waiting nervously to see how he responds. Answering with nothing and telling his own story or changing the subject makes me wonder if there's any point in opening up to him. It's just...really tiring feeling like I'm talking to open air."
5617,isfp,"Couldn't agree more. It's definitely noticeable. 
Sometimes it doesn't even fully matter what they say; often the bravery and honesty of just being real/open is soo damn beautiful.
I wish more people understood that. I am literally the least judgemental person you will ever come across. I think we all are."
5618,isfp,"I‚Äôm in this EXACT situation with this guy I‚Äôve been dating for five months now. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it but I‚Äôm so bored. I had a big talk with him recently to basically say I need more from him, he responded with his defense being that he always asks me how I am during the day and texts good morning and goodnight and how was work and how‚Äôs your dad and what are you up to and I‚Äôm just like.... it‚Äôs not enough?! 
So I thought it was my fault. Maybe I‚Äôm not appreciating his efforts enough. Maybe I‚Äôm not pulling my weight on the communication front. 
After reading this it kinda made me lose hope. Ugh. We‚Äôre just not connecting like I know I have the potential to and it‚Äôs frustrating. He‚Äôs perfect for me on paper and I don‚Äôt want to just give up. "
5619,isfp,"Shit. I just realise I ask very superficial questions as well. Do you have any advice for me (a INTP) when I talk to the girl (ISFP)?
‚Äã
I'm not trying to hijack or ignore what you say, but I'm basically scoping INTP/ISFP subreddit for things that can help me with the relationship I am currently trying to have. If you don't want to, it's fine."
5620,isfp,Hmm I can't speak for him but I do know that isfp's can be very self absorbed and if we're not careful we may fuck things up when people are trying to be open with us. Thanks for reminding me.. I need to be careful not to do that. It's not your fault regardless and you deserve a better response for opening up. That being said I'm not talking so much about opening up or self disclosure but more about just not having to hide intentions behind a mask.
5621,isfp,"In my opinion that's what happens when two Fi users talk to each other about emotions. Fi is not as tuned into other peoples emotions like Fe users. There will be much more emotional compatibility between TiFe user and FiTe user. Now people with Fi people may find Fe to be annoying as it seems fake, shallow or not real. That's due to the fact it's external, just realize to the Ti user it's the same way with a Te user's thoughts. Often thoughts expressed from a Te user are not very complex or has the depth a Ti user will look for. Even with that being said there is compatibility between the two. This is due to the fact that a person with  FiTe want's people to understand or to be aware of their emotions which an Fe person will do. Ti people want people to ask them what they think and Te people tend to be very concerned about the thoughts of others. If you ask an Fe person what they feel, it often what ever they are feeling will not run as deeply as an Fi user within the same function slot. Fe users are designed to absorb the emotion of others and harmonize with the other people.  Te people tend to absorb the thoughts of other people and thus their thoughts are not as complex as an Ti user. Think of the introverted cognitive functions as a source and the extraverted functions as something that consumes or absorbs that source.
‚Äã"
5622,isfp,"I will explain more. If you are truly and INFP then your function stack looks like this
INFP:
Hero Fi
Parent   Ne
Child Si
inferior Te
There is more than this but this is your primary ego. Now I will explain what the functions are in simplistic way and how they are linked. To start of  all thinking and feeling functions are judgement functions. They are the cognitive functions that deal with decision making. All intuition and sensor functions are perceiving functions. They deal with how we perceive the world. The functions are linked so that if you have one you are guaranteed to have the other. So for the judgement functions it as follows. Introverted Feeling (Fi) and Extroverted Thinking (Te).  If a person has Introverted Thinking(Ti) they will have Extroverted Feeling(Fe) .
For the perceiving functions; if you have extroverted intuition (Ne) you will have introverted sensing(Si). On the flip side if you have extroverted sensing(Se) you will have introverted intuition(Ni).
So what I'm saying is that you have the potential to find the most compatibility with a person who has the opposite functions. So if you have Fi in a hero or parent spot you will be likely to find the most compatibility with someone has Fe in the hero or parent spot. The reason you find the most compatibility is the extroverted and introverted functions tend to give each other what they want naturally without effort. Recall what I said earlier. For example Ti wants to share it's thoughts and Te wants to inquire about other people thoughts. If you have Ti and Te person in the relationship. The Ti person will likely not have to complain that his or her partner won't listen to his thoughts. The Te person will likely not have to complain that the Ti person will not share his thoughts. Of course all of this depends on the emotional and intellectual maturity of the people involved. To be clear those 4 functions I  listed above, you should be concerned with because they are primarily what you deal with in your day to day life.
TLDR if you want somebody to be tuned into your emotions find yourself and Fe user"
5623,isfp,Thank you for all your effort breaking this down for me! Its helped a lot. I do seem to swing between introverted and extroverted nearly 50/50  but it's been an anxious winter so I think this is as accurate as I'll get for the moment. 
5624,isfp,"How do you feel about consumption, materialism, self-expression through items, marketing, spending money, popular trends, or any related topic?
I tend to hold back on buying long-lasting things until I feel sure that it will help me be authentically me.
I buy a variety of foods each week, I express myself in my food tastes I suppose.
I no longer believe that I can love a song forever and expect my musical tastes to change.
Though I recognize that materials can help people express, I am also scared of getting in a cycle of spending money and buying things which are in the end, transient clutter. How about you?"
5625,isfp,I often get really fed up of all my stuff and get the urge to declutter. Throwing stuff out is often more cathartic than selling it. Typically when I move out of a place I leave half a dozen bin bags in my wake.
5626,isfp,"I am constantly looking at what I own and what I can get rid of. But when I do purchase something, I make sure that it's something I really love. Unfortunately, this has the consequence of spending a lot of time researching... and the item I really like is often 10x more expensive than something else that does the same purpose. Most of the items I do buy have to serve a purpose, while simultaneously being aesthetically pleasing. "
5627,isfp,"I consume massive amounts of media, and when I'm unhealthy I have a an impulse buying problem. Usually the stuff i watch read or listen to is stuff that aligns with my sense of authenticity,like Indie and diy stuff, however, sometimes I will partake of media that is at least partly big and dumb and explosive, because I think its inauthentic to deny that part of myself.
I'm constantly rebeling against my own values because I think values are stupid"
5628,isfp,"When it comes to physical goods, I like to treasure my things until they fall apart, and I like fixing and patching them up (with varying degrees of competence). I feel like the more I've had to do that, the more it becomes mine and mine only. Looking at the patched-over bits is really satisfying because it's like, ""look what we've been through together!"". Like a scar or a callus, but for objects.
When I do get the urge to acquire something random and pretty, I'll head to the thrift store. I don't think an appetite for niceties is a bad thing necessarily, but I still feel bad about it a lot of the time. Keeping it second-hand helps me feel less so, and if I lose interest in the thing, I can always donate it back. I like this because I get to engage with the material world without contributing tooooo much clutter to it."
5629,isfp,"If i buy stuff i like it to be good quality stuff that i actually really like. I dont buy stuff that i sort of like or buy stuff for the sake of buying stuff. I have to fall in love with it. Any shopping i do is second hand for the most part for sort of a moral reason but mostly because its cheaper and i like the treasure hunting feeling that i get from it. I also like to buy stuff from artists if i can. I have never had the mentality of ""must have the latest upgrade, must have the latest thing"". If im buying something its because it has mainly personal and/or practical value not because its a status symbol to have it. If i start to feel cluttered i get rid of things in a frenzy. I like a degree of minimalism and its refreshing with letting go of things. However I MOSTLY spend my money on going out to eat or getting a deep conditioner treatment or a massage tho. I like enjoyable sensual experiences more than having stuff."
5630,isfp,"Omg no it's not, I relate. What about it do you think is pretentious?
I think it makes sense to buy (what you deem) quality stuff because it 1) lasts longer for the price 2) you're not second-guessing your decision. Also, it makes sense to buy stuff you like because it has the best chance of making you happy, not buying something only because it is on sale or trendy. Buying stuff second hand isn't pretentious, you're right it is a challenge to have an idea in your head and try to make it materialize in clothes. I love buying from artists because you don't forget the story behind the object. It IS refreshing to let go of things because we change as people and of course materials don't matter as long as other parts of life do, but that DOESN'T mean that the objects didn't serve a function in our life up to that point. And lastly, buying experiences (I find in moderation) is part of taking care of yourself.
Edit: hehe unless I am also pretentious and blind to it"
5631,isfp,"Music!! See if she is into mixing audio? That's very interactive and creative. She already can play so shouldn't be a stretch. Painting also, goes hand in hand with music and poetry. If she likes making bracelets try buying her a bead set for the like. And lastly I'll suggest gardening, I've found this to be a fantastic outlet for creativity. "
5632,isfp,"Wheel throwing!  It's the form of pottery where you mold the clay with a spinning wheel. It's so so so fun once you get the hang of it. I like that it can be so many things. You can do it solo, you can do it with other people and be social, it can be really therapeutic/meditative too, and last but not least it's super creative. Even after you create what you've created from just the wheel spinning, you still gotta trim it up and paint it. I would absolutely encourage anyone try it out if you don't mind getting a little messy with your hands!"
5633,isfp,"My best friend's girlfriend is ISFP.  I live in a house with both him and her.  She's also a close friend of mine, and we go way back, buttttt our friendship can go from perfectly healthy to strained in a matter of minutes.  We're on great terms overall, but when we're alone, there's a slightly awkward subtext that feels like ""we don't get along, we're different"".  I try to bend over backwards to keep her happy and to avoid offending her, but it seems like I always inevitably piss her off or alienate her (e.g. sometimes with crude humor or sometimes by discussing philosophy/science/tech too much).  Any advice for how I can offend her less and speak in a way that's more relatable to her?
My current thinking is that I need to stop trying to make her happy and just listen to her feelings (Fi) without trying to change them.  I also need to give her space at times, instead of trying to aggressively build rapport (which I'm prone to doing with those in my inner circle of friends).
Thanks in advance! "
5634,isfp,"ISFPs are about actions, not words.
You won‚Äôt be comfortable having the kinds of conversations she wants to have, unless you‚Äôre into baring your soul and discussing your life and analyzing your feelings with her.
Barring that, that you would be better off engaging in activities with her that don‚Äôt require much conversation.
If she‚Äôs athletic, maybe bond through something physical. If she‚Äôs artistic, maybe go to crafts fairs or something."
5635,isfp,"look at having more open ended convos instead of a focus on being right or the opportunity to display intellect. 
realize the same way you view logic is the same way she probably view feelings. her logic is feelings. "
5636,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and even though this doesn't really have to do with your situation it might help. My boyfriend is an INTP and going into that knowing this information kind of made me think we would struggle, but we honestly don't. As an ISFP i get bored when he is talking about stuff i don't understand (especially tech things cause i'm honestly only half listening and half looking at the swoop in his hair) so it makes sense that your friends girlfriend doesn't really engage when you are talking about. my advice is to find a way to possibly combine your interests into a deep conversation. I'm more on the artistic side so maybe talk about a cool sculpture you saw and theorize on how they made it. she might have some information on it you never knew about. once you get an ISFP talking about something they really like its pretty hard to get them uninterested. "
5637,isfp,"Yesterday, I realized I had lost my wallet when I got home. I wasn't too woried about it because I was tired and I didn't want to make a big deal about it. When I told my partner he freaked out and started looking everywhere for it. I knew it wasn't stolen because I put it in my pocket when I left my car so I must have put it down somewhere in our house.
Long story short he got his whole family looking for it which  made everyone else stressed out and loud which in turn made me stressed, but not because of had lost my wallet lmao. It was because everyone else was tense and in my face and asking me the same questions over and over again. In the end I found it right outside my car (I missed my pocket I guess).
So my question today is, do you lose things frequently? I almost never lose important articles but trivial stuff I lose all the time. Do you get anxious when you lose important things, or do you try and stay calm and relaxed?"
5638,isfp,"Man i get anxious as hell, whenever I feel my usually wallet thick pocket and all i feel is air, that gets me super paranoid and extremely worried. 
I usually dont really lose things cuz I'm always making sure my things are around. But when i happen to lose something there is that sickening feeling that you're about to lose alot of important stuff. "
5639,isfp,"I'm with you on others being more freaked out about me losing stuff than I am. Take it from someone who left their bag on the bus which had their laptop and a $50 book in it. 
When I realised it was not on my back I did go into adrenaline mode, but once I'd taken all the steps to try and get it back (like calling the transport info lines and asking security at the station) it quickly turned into resignation. ""Well... fuck. There goes my stuff I guess... At least most of my important files were backed up on GDrive. And I did learn some cool stuff from that book, so I guess it wasn't a total waste.""
Meanwhile my friends are like ""DUDE HOW THE FUCK DID YOU NOT NOTICE YOU WERE MISSING YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING BACKPACK WTF""
That plus the many DS games I've lost on public transport means my friends do not trust me at all with borrowing things to take home. To which I respond, ""Fair enough haha""."
5640,isfp,"This subreddit is dead once again, so I thought we could discuss some good movies or shows that we recently watched. I recently watched Whiplash and it was really really good, I would recommend it to anybody."
5641,isfp,"orphan black most recently it's pretty good considering normally shows like that aren't that good. Mr robot starts soon I think, bates motel but I'm not liking it that much anymore.
Recommendations: The Place Beyond The Pines, is the best movie ever"
5642,isfp,"The Martian is excellent, I also watched full metal jacket for the first time and it's a Great War movie but it's incredibly depressing. I'm also watching old top gear episodes which are great and Game of Thrones which is really good. "
5643,isfp,"I just recently watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and it is AWESOME! Watching that movie led me to watch a few other Charlie Kaufman films that I think a lot of ISFP people might find interesting.
Being John Malkovich was a really fun movie with an cool story line. Definitely one I could watch again. 2 of Kaufman's movies that I really liked but will probably never watch again are Anomalisa and Synecdoche, New York. The way I felt after watching them was really weird. I was put in a freaky, depressing almost, funk, especially after watching S,NY. "
5644,isfp,"Same! I‚Äôve wanted one for years and told myself I need to be frugal and maintain my own floors. But I found one with great reviews and a good price on amazon so it was my housewarming gift to myself. I only wish I had bought one sooner! I haven‚Äôt decided on a name yet, I need a streak of inspiration "
5645,isfp,"yes, I don't open up to people right away- usually takes a while. I used to be very shy and didn't even mess around or joke with people I didn't know, but now I try to joke with everyone a little bit if I can."
5646,isfp,"I don't think theres anything wrong with that. You don't have to open up to anyone. The way I look at it. Its really hard to hurt my feelings because I don't open up to people unless I know damn well they aren't gonna hurt me. I'm by no means fragile, but inviting people I don't know to well to get to know me sounds like a bad idea. You're just protecting yourself.
I likewise only have 3 or 4 people who I let get to know me. Frankly thats only because they stuck around for long enough. I guess whatever charm my ISFP profile puts off kept them around. Real glad it did too."
5647,isfp,"Lol yeah, I don‚Äôt open up easily at all. I have a lot of friends, but we tend to talk about superficial things. I only have like 2 friends in the entire universe I‚Äôll actually talk to about personal things."
5648,isfp,I think I do well with people that are more shy then me. I am quite shy too. However when I speak to really shy people then I find it easy to joke around however I still don't open up to them properly. If someone is less shy then me then I don't know what to do haha. I mean it depends on the person and situation. Lots of people say that I'm reserved and I don't open up to them and I don't know what they mean by that and what I should do from that. 
5649,isfp,"yeah I agree, if I'm talking to someone else who's very shy there usually isn't much of a conversation.
I remember one dude I knew a few years ago and I could never talk with him, he just wouldn't engage. I have some co-workers like this as well. The other day I was trying to get one to show me how to use some program and it was like pulling teeth.
I think you just need more time to open up, that works for me "
5650,isfp,"I have this problem where I don't get enough space. Being left alone is nice and all but if I want to be productive I really need total and undisturbed tombal silence for at least 4 hours (half of it being necessary preparatory procrastination). I live with someone who's very noisy to say the least. I know it's impossible to get anything done with him
around. It's like trying to achieve meditation with a hive glued on my head. Any ideas/experiences to deal with this?"
5651,isfp,"My mother is like that. The rest of my family is loud, but my mother is the one who really stresses me out with unnecessary conversation, a louder volume and plenty of movement around the house. I need space and quiet time but I can't make it seem like I do nothing all day, so I plan around her. When she's up and moving around, I do the things that will make her the quietest: I do all the chores I need to do, I take a shower so she doesn't bother me, I take walks, whatever. I do anything that will either keep her quiet or I straight up leave. THEN when she's either settled in for the day, sleeping, or out of the house, that's when I allow myself to be productive. The problem with this is that I end up staying up laaate into the night just to do what I want to do. I would suggest just speaking to the person to leave you alone or be a bit quieter, however, I know that just doesn't make sense with some people (my mother). "
5652,isfp,"Ugh I feel your pain. The only thing that actually worked for me was to live alone. But then it gets lonely, too. Maybe just take advantage of times when your roommate isn't home. Does he ever leave? Like if he ever goes out partying you can stay in and have the place to yourself on those nights. Ninja your way around his schedule to maximize your home alone time. Sorry if this doesn't help at all"
5653,isfp,"Oh man I have the same problem. Even if I live with someone quiet, sometimes just them being there is too distracting and I can't get work done. Someone else suggested going somewhere else, like the library which is, what I do as well. "
5654,isfp,"My method with people has always been (or at least I have tried to make it) polite suggestion/request and when that doesn't work, just avoid them any way that you can. This tends to be the best course of action to solve problems and avoid conflict. I hope things work out for you. "
5655,isfp,"I feel like air: I'm there, I exist, people are aware of my existence, but absolutely nothing futher. Things I say just disappear a minute after I say them without anyone giving a second thought.
Maybe I'm depressed, or maybe it's the people I hang out with, or maybe I just really don't have anything of value to contribute. I really don't know. Any other ISFPs struggle with feeling this way?"
5656,isfp,"Agreeing with dangatang on this. More often than not, people tend to consider their needs first with everyone else being secondary or evemn tertiary. I doubt people are actively blowing you off, although minding your words and actions is something worth noticing just for the sake of making sure.
Speak up when working with others. There's a very good chance they're not ignoring you on purpose. No one's a mind reader, so just try your best to be assertive and politely voice your opinions and needs. And even if they are excluding you, there are many other people out there. There's no point in trying to keep people who mistreat you as ""friends"" when you could be making good, genuine friends somewhere else.
I hope this has been helpful, and I hope you find what you are looking for."
5657,isfp,"I have this problem too. Basically you need to practice assertiveness. It's how you say things that'll affect whether people listen or not. You gotta train them by speaking in an authoritative tone lol, it feels kind of manipulative but it works."
5658,isfp,Thanks for the insight. I've struggled with being assertive my whole life but I guess I've never connected these two issues. Can you recall some times when you were able to identify this issue during a social situation and addressed it immediately? How do you ensure that you're assertive when necessary?
5659,isfp,"It's hard for me to just like ""engage assertiveness"" on the spot when needed. It's more like a change in overall mindset before even going into an interaction. Communication includes body language, so if your body says you're going with the flow, then you try to say something authoritative, people won't believe you. Think of it like turning off your Fi and turning on your Te. It's kind of like seeing everyone around you as giant toddlers who need to be told what to do/how to behave, and if you don't continuously keep them in check then chaos will break out and you will get trampled. Your communication will become more authoritative naturally with this change in mindset. You'll notice yourself smiling a lot less and being less accommodating to others' comfort. Think of the stern school teacher.
I hope this makes sense! It works for me but it makes me feel like a different person and it makes me very utilitarian in how I view people so I only do it when I'm dealing with especially difficult people."
5660,isfp,"It sometimes happens in the middle of someone talking to me. If they are talking too much I lose my inability to process what they are saying and I just have to pretend like I‚Äôm listening. Especially if they are speaking without a point and just rambling. I feel bad, and I try to listen but it‚Äôs like my brain gets overwhelmed and shuts down lol"
5661,isfp,"As for me, here's the positive: much more self awareness, much more tolerance toward people as I tend to see more easily why they act the way they act, a definite will to defy isfp's bad tendencies (passivity and easily giving up for ex), being able to think of Ni loops in terms of ""me looking for clues to put myself down"" and not reality, a general grown interest in people and their behaviour, a more positive Ni and as such a will to understand and construct goals
The negative: Sometimes I have a hard time discerning if I am doing efforts or if I am faking and understanding if my interest in people comes from a selfish sorta need to improve or a genuine interest and love, I have thought at times to have figured out only to realize Ni was not on point on the case (but knowing we have Ni ter has allowed me much more modesty and genuine interest in the point of view of others, therefore less subjectivity), I have tended to use Ni way too much on whys and hows rather than using Se aux, which has left me feeling empty at times...
I could go on haha but I am very curious! How does this whole theory affect you and your life?"
5662,isfp,"Being able to explain the words and actions of others in terms of MBTI  has gone  a long way to feeling as though I understand those people and has given me hope of being understood.
In addition, further thought in this arena has given me alternate methods on constructing thoughts by intentionally negating conscious processes in favor of unconscious or subconscious processes.  
I recognize just how much of what I do is based on the insecurities held in the 4th function, so I alter my aims in long term goals such that filling the void of the fourth function doesn‚Äôt become a waste of time and energy, but instead direct my goals such that attention is given to the third function where I need the most help.
‚Äî
The negatives stem from falling into the belief that I am much more like a machine than I am, following an inner structure I cannot control. 
There are false applications of this theory to be wary of, and suspending the fullest expression of belief can be helpful.  For me, understanding that mistyping happens and that no theory is immune to revision helps me to hold back from ‚Äúrunning with it‚Äù where there are significant risks."
5663,isfp,"There is more, but to keep it short, my latest discovery has been that I am an ISFP rather than an ESFP. I always said/thought I was an extrovert because I love people and I love being in the company of others and connecting to others. But I get SO DRAINED from it. I am an introvert all the way, and just admitting to myself that I am an introvert has been kind of freeing in a way. I try not to use it as an excuse to not socialize, but it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúokay, I know my limits and I know this is draining me and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs okay if I soend Friday night by myself and get excited about that - and it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a weirdo!‚Äù
And that‚Äôs only with the intro/extrovert part! "
5664,isfp,"Yeah haha I did NOT mention Te inf for reasons... A bit like one avoids the mention of Satan
For real though I feel like the Te inf motivational quest is very long and most likely a never ending one. I have looked for older isfps' tips and here are the tricks I have read so far:
-Baby steps are extremely important, for example by starting with 1h of compulsory work a day and by rewarding ourselves greatly
-Motivation is more easy from Se (which is about pure adaptability and willpower), therefore, before getting ourselves to work, talking to people we love (IRL if possible, the aim is Se), taking a walk early in the morning, listening to music or any other greatly fulfilling Se aux activity can motivate us.
-One especially motivational method (that gives Ni ter positivity) is to always remind ourselves WHY it is important to do it, the long terms goals behind. The best way to do this is to actually keep those goals written in our phone or in our room, to SEE them often.
-Personalizing is good. Very good. When we create a planning made in our ways, with a system of our own, it can be very fullfilling and more enjoyable (most likely a written, tangible one)
-Lists of anything for the next week, and then the freedom to do anything we feel like in the order we enjoy. I think the trick is to create an organisation that leaves place for surprise, or else our Se is drained.
Please do not hesitate if you have more tips to add !"
5665,isfp,"For me it's more that me having Te inferior explains my constant blunders with planning and time management. It also enforces my certainty of my type... kind of like a confirmation bias, although I know I'm definitely inferior Te. It's just like, yep, Te is my inferior. (It happened today as well)"
5666,isfp,Same here... I've been able to finish two illustrations in one night for an art education preliminary assignment deadline. (Too bad I couldn't return all of the assignments in time... another one of my Te fails.)
5667,isfp,"Hey mates, i have an ISFP friend which i love, he is my best friend and is like the brother I've never had. recently, he has suicidal thoughts. his passion is music and life has led him into military service, he'll be done in two years and can pursue him dreams, but he is spent. and i'm extremely worried about him. he keeps saying i can't keep on, and he is just gotten rejected by the girl he loved so hard(whom i resented as hard). i mean, i understand his pain, i'm in a similar situation, and when he exhibits suicidal behaviors it really worries me. i need to do something, i'm an ENTJ, emotional support is not my strong suit, i need advice, how can i make him feel better?"
5668,isfp,The only thing I can think of is to tell him he should go to consoling. I personally have gone to consoling and found it to help a lot with the depression I had. I don't know how that would work with him being in the military. He should know that going to consoling is not something to be ashamed of. Sorry this is the only thing I could think of.  
5669,isfp,"I think you need to figure out the source of his suicidal thoughts. Does he truly feel like he can't ever be happy again? Maybe you need to remind him of the life that is waiting for him when he finally leaves the military. Thinking of doing something we don't like for the rest of our lives or thinking of struggling for the rest of our lives make us go down the hole at a faster pace. I know because I've been there, and I'm still very apprehensive about the future. Be careful about painting a picture that is too optimistic though. We always doubt consolation when we are already in a depressive state. "
5670,isfp,"Hope you're still around. Think i know what you meant by the 2 years.
I probably went through the same myself. Actually did attempt suicide as well but guess my willpower was strong. Anyways i'm done with my 2 years and continued with life. 
As an ISFP I can understand how he feels.
I personally did go for counselling as well but didn't find it useful. 
Perhaps the counsellor didn't bode well with him. Maybe you could try a different counsellor. 
Also, emotional support is very important. Try to get him to interact with his friends when he is out.
Maybe get him to read an inspirational quote everyday (there are many smartphone apps that offer this)
as he will tend to brood on negative thoughts often. A positive compliment or get him to look at positive side of things.
If he experiences problems during his time inside, get him to talk about it and discuss a solution or get him to see it in a less negative way (I know many unreasonable stuff happens in there) that will probably lessen his anxiety.
It might take a little convincing or encouragement before he will share his problems as ISFPs tend to bottle them up (sometimes to the point where they cant take it anymore) encourage him to share his thoughts.
Generally talking to people he trusts like friends or family will lighten his mood (If he went thru the same 2 years then I believe he is allowed to use his phone at night)
ISFP respond better to encouragement than criticism (Can be very harsh inside for ISFP as the military works on a 
punishment system)
As for the girl, may take some time for him to heal. Could try to get him to see that there are other better girls or learn from the experience. But might be hard to get through when the ISFP is so caught up in emotions. May really take some time because ISFP feels very deeply in relationships. Whatever you do, don't force an opinion on him. Getting him to share his thoughts and then questioning him on other viewpoints or possibilities to slowly steer his thinking to another direction would more effectively get him to see a better picture of things. An example would be like to ask what he liked about the girl and slowly steer the conversation such that he sees that it is possible to find other girls like her or that one failed relationship isn't everything. He still has opportunities to explore. Although don't force if he is uncomfortable.
Although I might be sharing what might help based on myself, but depression being something of a mental illness requires attention. Is still best to seek professional help
p.s.
Sorry if the post is long winded and repetitive.
Not very good at articulating my thoughts
Any ISFP feel free to add on or correct anything that I have shared
I sincerely hope he doesn't end up touch wood at the point of no return.
As a fellow ISFP i do hope that he will get better.
--- edited because it was hard to do formatting as I was typing on a tablet previously ---"
5671,isfp,"i took him to a university in which they teach music, the passion in his eyes was great, but the thing is, he is in the military base all the time, and i'm quite busy too. that makes it hard for me to meet him in person."
5672,isfp,"Thank you for the time you spent on writing the comment, you had some good points there. you see,i'm not the best at emotional support and that's why i asked your help. I'm an ENTJ, i know how to deal with problems head on, i can't offer emotional support. i will try to act on the points you said,thanks."
5673,isfp,"You should tell him that. He just doesn't believe he has control over his life. Probably in an unhealthy Fi-Ni loop, thinking about the future and imagining the worst outcomes based on what he believes is a realistic set of standards. We are very critical of ourselves and feel powerless in our depressive state, leading to self-fulfilling prophecies. We don't believe in the best in ourselves, and we need people who understand us to convince us things will change. We don't only need optimistic ""you can do it"" stuff, we need reasoning (which thinking types are good at) based on concrete circumstances. When I was bullied constantly in elementary school, my ESXJ mom convinced me that passing specialized exams and getting into great schools would give me a better future and that I shouldn't care about my classmates' mean comments because it was temporary pain. We need to see a concrete path (achievable steps) and we need to believe that we can achieve them. Telling him you saw his eyes light up when he went to the university may make him consider whether or not his passions are really not worth it. It's the first step in fighting for his happiness and his life, because he needs to believe in himself before building his career. This was long, but I hope you understand what I am trying to say... I know I ramble sometimes. Lastly, tell him you're always here if he needs to talk. "
5674,isfp,"Also, spending everyday at the military base does not help at all. I think you may have to keep reminding him that it will be temporary (along with the pain with the girl) without making it seem like you are saying he is weak. Also, if you are to offer him advice on how to improve his circumstances, be optimistic in your tone. My mom would try to help me in this but it always seemed like she was nagging at me and trying to bring me down."
5675,isfp,"I always place all over the place on the tests, because I find the questions are super vague and how I'd answer them a lot of the time entirely depends on the context, so I answer with a different context in mind, I get a different result.  Most of the time it places me as an INFP, several years ago it was almost always INTP, but lately sometimes it gives me ISFP.  I read them and there's things about all of them that I agree with.  But I'd just like to know which one is more me.  Is there any way to help narrow it down?"
5676,isfp,"I‚Äôve had a similar experience. I usually typed as ISTP and sometimes INFP or ISFP. I did a leadership course and spent a few days going through it and it helped me figure out I was actually ISFP but typed as ISTP because of my upbringing and the social norm that men are supposed to be cold and logical. Then after the course I looked more into the cognitive functions and pretty much confirmed it. The difference between INFP and ISFP is the Ne and Si or for ISFP Se and Ni. So the S makes more sense to me but Se is taking in info from the outside world, ie enjoying exploring, reading, seeing things work etc. Si relies more on memories and uses Ne to figure stuff out. 
So I found a podcast which explains these things not too bad and it made so much more sense to me. I think it was personality hacker. 
Also remember that we use ALL these functions or thought processes at different times, the MBTI types are just which do we usually revert to automatically. Think of it like how we usually revert to our dominant hand, especially when doing something more challenging. 
I hope this helps ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5677,isfp,"My journey to ISFP was similar, I had INTP initially too. Maybe I became softer over the years haha (T to F swap). Contex changes things a lot. My first test I did at work years ago. My work me is very different in a sense that, for example, my work email is super tidy and organised. My personal one I may have hundreds of unopened emails and I do not care at all. Introvert bit has always been the sllid part which never changes, the rest depended on context. I do however feel that ISFP is the best representation of myself, even though the commitment phobe in me resents the classification process itself!"
5678,isfp,"I mean, I can‚Äôt say what you are based on what you said. Though personally, along with other ISFPs I can relate with the whole ‚Äúchanging depending on context‚Äù thing. But that‚Äôs probably not an ISFP only trait so idk. 
Your best bet is just to research cognitive functions. You can take a test, such as the keystocognition one. Or just research them yourself. ISFPs use Fi,Se,Ni,Te. See if that fits for you when you read about how each function works. 
You could also do a type me post. I‚Äôm not sure where, the actual mbti sub probably. There might even be a sub dedicated to typing if I remember correctly. 
If you have any other questions I can try help but really the best evaluation is the one you give yourself from researching. Good luck!"
5679,isfp,"Yeah, on the tests the N/S is always like 52/48 or so in either direction, and F/T usually like 60/40. I've found to actually get problems solved I usually have to put aside how I feel about the situation. I and P are always like 95/5, they don't change."
5680,isfp,"Yeah I know I don't fit any one mold perfectly otherwise I wouldn't be in this situation, but I find MBTI to be really helpful in figuring out why I think the way I do and how to sorta avoid the pitfalls of that way of thinking that I might otherwise be unaware of"
5681,isfp,"Yeah the test isn‚Äôt real good for figuring it out because basically it‚Äôs trying to guess your usual thought processes by your actions. It gives you a good start point but. 
Definitely check out the cognitive functions. Just google ISFP and INFP cognitive functions and it gives you a diagram. Then check out the difference because they are very similar to each other obviously and focus on what they mean.
Yeah so N/S is like how you take in information. 
Also one big difference is 
INFPs are much better at understanding big and complex concepts. Especially social dynamics because of the F. Would make a good author or poet if they‚Äôre interested in that. 
ISFPs are much more in tune with their surroundings and senses in the moment making them more spontaneous. Would make a good artist or dancer if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre interested in. 
Also INFPs tend to express themselves with words, writing etc. ISFPs will choose to be more visual or action based. 
Also do you tend to do things in order, focused on a task. When you read do you read it in order or jump back and forwards skimming over a lot?
Let me know if you have any more questions ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5682,isfp,hi guys! whenever I meet a group of people I always tend to choose a favourite person and the I always stick to them and talk to them the most I kinda of obsess over the person ( not in a stalkerish way) it‚Äôs just for instance if I‚Äôd have to ask a clammate something I‚Äôd always just choose to ask to that person basically I stay shy to everyone but that friend I decide to open uo to. I do this unconsciously but one day one person I don‚Äôt talk to as often pointed it out and I was like whattt  Do you guys experience the same thing?
5683,isfp,"Does anyone else ever feel like they care way more about their friends than their friends do about them? Like I drive hours every couple days to go hangout with them and drive them around and I plan everything and never ask for gas money... And I feel like they never really are very appreciative. But they're still good people.
Apologies for the rant-like post"
5684,isfp,"Hmmm if we‚Äôre being honest, this isn‚Äôt true for me. I have a couple of really amazing friends who reciprocate, and for the people I‚Äôm not as into, they tend to care more about me than I do them. 
But I tend to feel bad about the fact that they care about me more so I let these people treat me like shit for a little bit (I.e. doing all kinds of favors for them or putting up with their BS) before distancing myself from them completely. "
5685,isfp,"They always want to hang out with me, they rant to me about people who leave them so I get guilted into staying a week or two longer than I should in the friendship, they get mad at me / feel insecure when I avoid them, then they ask me to do favors for them, etc.
So I guess maybe they don‚Äôt care about me per say, they care about my approval of their friendship and my companionship. So in that sense you‚Äôre totally right "
5686,isfp,"I dunno man, it kinda sounds like those friends care more about themselves and what they can get out of your friendship than they do about you.  Although to be honest, I can see how even if they had selfless intentions it would be hard to give anything to me because I just don't want anything.
At the same time I've been wrong about people before.  Made some really great friends with whom I shared no interest but they kept calling me to hang out, turns out they were actually pretty cool.  I guess it's kind of hard to attract those kind of people when I'm pretty avoidant myself."
5687,isfp,"Not really when I'm relaxed, but over the past couple years I've been making rap albums as basically an emotional outlet. I like rapping because I can make a while product myself without knowing how to play any instruments, hahaha."
5688,isfp,"I have so many hobbies.
Computers, Photography, Hifi Audio, Weaving, Woodworking, Music, Wrist Watches, Video Games, Mechanical Keyboards and probably a few more at some point.
My discovery of wearing a watch has recently taken over my brain. I haven't been taking many photos at all recently because it's just turning spring and winter was boring outside this year.
Honestly I could sit here and type ten paragraphs trying to explain all of my hobbies but I won't. I believe that this is all just the result of my brain grasping for creative outlook while I'm currently in a boring rut in my life (working a boring job that's not in my field). I have nothing to complain about in my life other than the fact that being content with my hobbies is difficult when your personality craves precision and emotional peace. 
I'm in a wonderful relationship with a beautiful and understanding INFP (thank the karma gods). I graduate college in a month. I'm awaiting a response from a promising job interview so I can leave my under-appreciating retail job. I have nice possessions but ofc I consider selling them to get nicer options. I'm only content with about a half of my possessions and it makes me feel silly but oh well, I like having nice things.
Don't mind me, I'm just trying to grasp my thoughts around understanding why I am the way I am. That understanding is temporary of coarse.
What a great personality type. I love who I am but I am constantly reminded how thin the line that my sanity travels on actually is. Hi friends    "
5689,isfp,"""What a great personality type"" This made me smile and my day didn't start well, so thank you. :) I have almost the same hobbies but something is stopping me from having fun with them, so I don't even do it and just sit around and watch Netflix.
I wish you luck in getting the new job, I know very well how depressing it is to work in a field you dislike."
5690,isfp,"Life is too short not to find something you enjoy. I was in a deeper rut like yours. What I did to fix it was picking the hobbie that was the oldest and pushing myself to pursue it. Enjoy your days my friend, they'll get longer when you have more fun."
5691,isfp,"I consider Fi as giving me a set of preferences, whether they might be similar to others or not. (Actually I think most of my bonding experiences with people might come from having similar preferences.) Also usually knowing what is of worth investing my time into and what's not.
Another way of describing Fi could be a very precise way of seeing emotions. I usually know what ticks people off and what doesn't."
5692,isfp,"Honestly I have no idea
Edit: second thought, I would say I don't have a high sense of morality. I kinda follow my own rule book. I could actually be ISTP tbh. Im new to this, bc I used to think I was an INTP üòÜ"
5693,isfp,"I have a tapestry on my desk with green, blue, purple, and lavender in a mandala pattern -  it's nice :) Also, I have some meaningful pictures and albums to the side.
Which of your decorations put you in a favorite mood?"
5694,isfp,I wouldn't say it puts me in my favorite mood but I just got my first blackout curtains for my room. I spent two hours picking them out and they really fit well in my room. The really help with noise and naps.
5695,isfp,"I have a nice lamp with soothing light and a small statue of sleeping budha on my bedside table. This really gets me in a calm and peaceful mood.
Got a few posters of my favourite book covers and quotes on the wall infront of my bed as well."
5696,isfp,Well this is basic but my twinkle lights of course and also this shell wind chime? Hangy thingy? idk what you call it. Any way its made out of shells strung together and you hang it up. I got it from a teeny tiny thrift shop on the island of saint kitts in the Caribbean. Its the only souvenir i got on the trip and its my favorite thing in my room. 
5697,isfp,"I just love the high risk high reward nature of the game. It is also much faster than trying to grind value on a blackjack/craps table. I mean sure. I'm better than your average bear at both of those games, but Roulette can payout 35 times to 1, and it takes like one minute to place the bet and see if you hit."
5698,isfp,"wow. i guess not all ISFP‚Äôs are the same. i absolutely detest gambling. but if i had to, my game of choice would be low stakes blackjack‚Äî since you can take your time, maybe finish an entire cocktail, you‚Äôre just killing time till dinner.
maybe this is more a girl/boy thing. or an age thing. "
5699,isfp,"I've only gone to the casino in video games, but yeah:P I actually don't mind black jack, but when I play with friends I'm usually just fucking around and there to socialize, so I don't pay much attention to my cards"
5700,isfp,Possibly. I did table games training at a casino a few years back and something about the randomness and the bad odds calls out to me. For whatever reason it just feels more like real gambling. Theres no numbers to crunch and its outside my control.
5701,isfp,"I can be very arty; enjoy photography, cross stitch, making sentimental gifts for friends and family, listening to music, photoshopping, painting, print making, pottery, colouring in etc. But most of the time I lack motivation to do any of it, or start and never finish because I seen to get bored by it... any one else? Please tell me I'm not as shitty at being an ISFP as I think,and that there are more out there like me!"
5702,isfp,"You are not shitty at being ISFP, but ISFP could struggle to describe you. You are good at being you, someone we all need.
I do this too.
I like to pick three or so projects/ hobbies for the month and alternate them or choose the most desirable one when I am deciding what to do. Narrowing down your options gives you a chance to pick what best expresses your values at the current time and makes it more likely that you'll go farther on each individual project. Plus, remember that art is never really finished."
5703,isfp,"Not very often at all, maybe once every few months, it‚Äôs gotten more often now that I‚Äôm out of my depression. It did get to a point where I thought I had a heart of stone. Even when I do cry though, it is completely in private."
5704,isfp,I‚Äôve felt the same! I have cried and will sometimes. But there will also be times I won‚Äôt cry.. but probably should? Idk. I‚Äôve questioned things like that too. Its not necessarily that the thing doesn‚Äôt affect me; I just feel like it doesn‚Äôt effect me the way I thought it should. Then with other things - it will affect me wayyy more than it should lmao.
5705,isfp,"Basically how I see it is Fi doms strive for internal harmony at all times. Analyze things and people around themselves to see how they relate to themselves. 
Aux Fi makes decisions based on internal harmony, but first it wants to take in the information outside (through Se or Ne, in your case Se)."
5706,isfp,"Dom Fi is more apparent in ISFPs than in ESFPs. When the function is in the aux, there is a tendency for the user to skip it entirely, and fall on the third function instead, it being more comfortable than the aux function. So an ESFP is just as likely to show Te as Fi, so their Fi is more diluted compared to ISFPs, who use their Fi ALL. THE. TIME."
5707,isfp,"I've seen this in action.  I deal with tested ESFPs and ISFPs a lot, and the ESFPs are much, much better at using their logic (Te) than ISFP.  Logic/facts/objective systems exhausts the ISFP.  
Facts/logic is useful to the ESFP and they use it very well.. They easily change their opinion when they are given opposing facts by people or simply by meeting diverse people that live in contrary to what they already know.   
ISFPs take a looooong time of letting things marinate before they will change their mind and will almost be offended by the cognitive dissonance created by opposing facts to their inner world."
5708,isfp,"I'm an ENTJ,
Ok let me try and make a long story concise here...:
Background:
One of my closest and most long-time friends is an ISFP, we grew up together and were like brothers. A few years ago he got into a really bad downward spiral driven by an adderall (prescription amphetamine) abuse problem. He seemed to be struggling with a lot of paranoid and delusional thoughts and he quit college, work, family and moved into a room in his GF's family's house and played ""call of duty"" all day for two years. He had surrounded himself with enablers and complacent people.
I moved back from college to find him in this state and, over a period of about a year and a half, slowly but quite forcefully pushed him to reenter society. In the process I got him a good job at my workplace and he has been adjusting, he's been normal-ish for about 1 year.
Although initially my goal was to rehabilitate him 100%, he seems to be permanently changed from the person he was before the ordeal, and I accept that now for the most part.
Now:
However, in the past 4 months or so, he has started to relapse into irrational and paranoid thinking, and this time the target is me. His belief is that I am ""talking gossip"" about him and that I constantly hound him for ""favors"". He will bend or twist any interactions or events to fit as evidence to reinforce this narrative. 
For example:
-Any time I ask him about something going on in his life (small talk), he gets extremely defensive. Believing I am trying to pry for gossip to tell others.
-If friends or acquaintances know something about his life, he will interpret that as evidence of my gossiping. (his memory is poor, and often times he was the one that told them, but he forgot).
-He will bring up a list of 2 small favors he helped me with 1-2 years ago and get really resentful about it. I have stopped asking for anything from him for a long time now. But I can't escape this resentment for these past favors.
On several occasions now, we've discussed in depth these thoughts and actions, and corroborated with mutual friends that his thinking seems unusual. Each time he seemed to mellow out and start to trust me for a few weeks, only to return back to the irrational thinking.
As it stands now, I've decided try to switch strategies and give him space instead. As a result our relationship is basically on a communications blackout for 2 months. However, since I got him a job at my workplace, I still have to interact with him and its very tense and uncomfortable.
I'm not sure if these issues are related to the ISFP type or if it's a sign of mental illness?
Can anyone relate? 
How can I escape from this zone of scapegoat/ enemy? 
Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks everyone!
TL;DR
ENTJ with an ISFP friendship falling apart due to irrational suspicion of gossiping and resentment of ""favors"". plz help"
5709,isfp,"INFJ here. Married to an ISFP.
My wife has encountered similar issues, and I personally can't stand how many times I hear ""Get her professional help"". My response is essentially ""No shit!"" Trust me, if fixing mental health was as easy as seeing a therapist or taking some pills, we'd all want to be fixed and we'd all immediately seek out those options without hesitation.
But it doesn't work like that, and this type I notice tends to avoid talk therapy like the plague. ISFP's are stubborn and HATE talking about their problems. They feel cornered and evasive when sitting face to face with someone and are expected to lay out their inner sufferings. And believe me, as someone who loves talking and loves therapy, even under the best circumstances, it doesn't always work so well. To get anything out of therapy, you first have to believe that you WANT it, and you NEED it. If you don't believe yourself, forget it. It's not going to work. And ISFPs are a pain for getting them to change their habits. They look at it like a personal attack on their ""individuality"" or something. 
Sorry if I sound a little frustrated, but was actually just on the verge of making my own post. I don't know how anyone in this typing ever fixes themselves when they are broken. They desperately want to do things their own way, which is awesome and wonderful! But when they are doing something that's at their detriment and everyone's around them, they will resist your help, and then when you take a more forceful approach  they will go totally cold on you.
I don't know the answer... and Honestly, if I were to guess, I'd say you just have to take them as they are and do the best you can. For your specific situation. Give your friend space. Forcing him to turn his life around was definitely like... the #1 ""no-no"" with this type. They'll go along for a little while, but they internalize everything and will eventually go stone cold on you or blow up. Moments like those are a bit scary. Just give them time, and maybe defer to simple gestures of kindness to show you really care about them. ISFPs are surprisingly receptive to these types of things.
As far as fixing them. It might be best to consider it from another angle. Maybe the problem isn't entirely with them, but perhaps its in your suffocating expectation that they need to act in a way you'd like them to? In your case, as much as you might care for him, he's not your roommate or lover, is he? You have the luxury of space that friendship offers. It can be more easily used to take the good with the bad."
5710,isfp,sounds a little more like the schizophrenia my mom was diagnosed with this year and she's an ISTJ. So just talk to a metal health specialist honestly. Sorry youre dealing with that. I know it's not fun. Youre a great friend:)
5711,isfp,"Yeah, I want to agree 100% but I need more information. Being an ISFP with bipolar disorder I can tell you from experience that unmedicated bipolar psychosis can look a HELL of a lot like BPD. But, because this seems to be a pattern of destructive behavior and interpersonal relationships I'm also leaning more towards personality disorder. You need to get him psychologically evaluated, esp. if you feel he is a danger to himself or others. Simply call the police and let them know of the situation, your history etc. Otherwise I say this might be a lost cause, and I say that with caution considering everyone wanted to pull the plug on me even though I was still alive underneath the insanity. Not to sound edgy with that last part but there's nothing else to describe it."
5712,isfp,"oh man, you are married to an ISFP - I've been in somewhat of a relationship with one for 5 years and I think we're getting to the stone cold situation...any advice on how to turn that around? I try to show kindness as much as possible - bringing coffee over, sending little gift baskets - especially since I know he must be lonely, too. But, I'm afraid this is farther down the stone-cold path as we've ever gone and I don't know how to fix it :("
5713,isfp,"Thanks for being the first one to actually offer advice. (Yeah, I already know it seems like the seeds of mental illness or personality disorder). Also I've already adopted the space strategy. I just stopped bothering him now, and am waiting for a day when he'll call me instead of me calling him. And we haven't spoken in 3 months.
Honestly I've already given up on the relationship as a lost cause, and I'm ok with whatever happens. I posted in here just to see if there was some other angle I didn't think of or some way of thinking that was over my head.
Again, the real problem now is that I can't get out of this ""scapegoat"" role he's created and locked in for me in his mind."
5714,isfp,"Yes it's likely a lost cause without professional help or the luck of a change. If I had a friend like this who was so far out there, I wouldn't let myself be bothered by them or feel tense. Because while I'm good with understanding emotions and helping with them at times, I'm certainly no psychologist and they are in need of serious help, which his or her family is very much responsible for providing the help‚Äîeven the ones who live with him or her. Most times, I believe, the lack of support is what causes these disorders to get worse at the beginning, and eventually causing the person to require professional help. 
For the OP's problem on the other hand, I feel like it's their own fault for feeling uncomfortable, because, unless they feel responsible for helping said person, it makes a lot more sense to try to move on and not let another person interfere with one's own feelings and emotions‚Äîespecially if he seems to have a disorder. That is the only way one ""escapes."""
5715,isfp,"Hehe, yep. About 5-7 years is about right for an ISFP.
Well first off, are you two dating, engaged, married? It sounds like you're not living in the same space?
So one thing you have to come square with is the fact that nothing you do at this point is going to help, and if you push them too hard, they'll likely feel pressured and turtle up more. ISFPs in relationships are magical. They really are super sweet, and come through in so many ways, and are uncannily agreeable with all of your crazy ideas. But after a while they become burnt out, and it's not that they love you any less, they just need to recharge, and can become very cold and standoffish while doing this. For the other partner it's terrifying and anxiety inducing.
The best thing you can do is use this time to work hard on yourself. I know that seems silly, but likely there are things in the relationship that might annoy them that they simply don't talk about. Every relationship has it's issues, but when there's no communication even the tiniest thing can get out of hand over a long period of time like 5-7 years. And that amount of time is a famous stumbling point for many relationships. So don't feel bad! 
Your partner is likely using this time to let whatever it is that's bothering them slowly drain out. And you can use this opportunity to dig deep, and maybe find ways of dealing with your fear and anxiety. Figure out where you're lacking, and use the time to help make yourself happy. You can't control anything they do, but you can control what you do, and you can use that to make yourself happy. In the end, that's what they want for you anyways. And in addition, your ISFP partner DOES love you. They're just recharging and need time before they come out of their shell. It will be a lot easier for them to come out of their shell if they don't feel pressured by the responsibility of figuring out how to make you feel less anxious and more happy. 
I'd honestly wait until they come to you to initiate any form of talking out issues. But at some point in the future you two will need to improve your communication. When the time comes, don't be afraid to be somewhat forward and as simple as you can be. Say very simply that you notice they're more quiet that usual, you love them, and you're feeling a bit anxious. Express an interest in wanting to talk more. Or just point blank ask them how they're feeling and if you're doing anything that's bothering them. 
As an INFJ, we love talking out and sharing our feelings. We love big ""come to jesus"" meetings where there's a lot of talking, a big revelation, and a hug at the end. It's somewhat of a romantic fantasy for us. But with ISFPs, you're going to want to shy away from these conversations and keep things as brief and casual as possible. You'll notice that the second you try confronting them with the desire to have a long conversation, they'll likely look a little dodgey or uneasy. For the ISFP, laying out their inner feelings is a monumental feat. They feel what they have to say can be too easily misunderstood, and that often times it might be too complex to do any justice with words. Try as hard as you can to respect this, and try not to take it personally. I know it can suck to not be able to talk and get that release when you need it, but this is what communication is TRULY about. And that is finding out the best way your partner communicates and working with them patiently.
There's a book that TRULY helped me with my marriage. Call me cheesy here, but I'm dead serious. My wife and I were separated after 6 years of being together and I was terrified that we might be finished.
""Men are From Mars, Women are from Venus.""
It's a great read. I promise you some of the basic things mentioned in that book will go a Looooong way.
One last thing I'll mention. ISFP's have this scary meltdown point, that, after they've held something in for too long, they will feel overwhelmed and just go postal. I mean redfaced screaming and just all out exploding. If this happens to you, DO NOT ARGUE. Let them throw their tantrum and get it all out. I promise you they'll come around and will probably regret their actions immensely. Either way, you can avoid getting them to this point by simply giving them the space they need, and letting them drain their frustration naturally.
I seriously hope this helps. I've made a lot of deep assumptions here. So Please take this with a grain of salt, and don't feel afraid to reach out to me via PMs if you wanted to talk anything out. c:"
5716,isfp,"No problem man. I'm really sorry things are kind of going south with your friendship. I can truly say.. it happens.
I will say though, ISFPs can go long periods of time without reaching out to people. It doesn't always mean they're mad, they can just be secluded people. If you're waiting for them to make the first move, you might be waiting a while... or forever. You never know. After some time passes they might be feeling regretful and longing of your company, but are simply too stubborn or prideful to contact you.
The most important thing here is you. Set up your boundaries, and firmly decide what you're willing to put up with in your head. If a time comes where you're willing to reach out again, simple gestures or acts of kindness go oh so far with these guys, and they're surprisingly easy to reconnect with even after long periods of time.
Good luck man. Here for you if you need it. Don't feel afraid to PM."
5717,isfp,"Yeah I agree. I just have hang ups about leaving people I know aren't going to make it. But, always go no contact if the person is past the precipice and cannot be reached, and as I said: Never be afraid to call the police if you feel they are a threat to themselves or others. Never take their threats of harming themselves or others lightly."
5718,isfp,"Post music about being alone/introverted. Found this song a little while ago and really like it. Just curious what's out there.

5719,isfp,"Do they relate to you, or does the story just pull at your heartstrings?
What about these songs makes them speak to you? 
I'll try start us off, knowing how recluse we are.
Iced Earth's ""A Question of Heaven,"" is about a man giving up trying to find peace in the self after giving up his soul to be with the woman he loved, only to find she loves his best friend. His torment is entirely within, and after death he is denied entry to heaven he turns his melancholy into frustration. His eternal existence is dedicated to regret, sorrow, and frustration. His passion for his feelings and how true to them he is speaks to me. That he would sacrifice everything to be with what he loves. After being tricked into selling his soul for the one he loves, finding he can't love her due to circumstances out of his control, and being denied by heaven, he goes on into purgatory only blaming himself while holding frustration for his entire situation. 

Oof."

5721,isfp,"srry to revive this thread out of nowhere.. I'd say ""Sometimes"" by My Bloody Valentine is one of the most introspective things I've listened to, even though the lyrics are kind of distorted from all the noise.."
5722,isfp,"Holy shit, never thought I'd see anybody reference Iced Earth in an MBTI-feeling-related post. Only got the one upvote to hand ya, but it's well-deserved!
Malukah - Reignite (Mass Effect tribute) - Using elements from the OST (link) and more or less doing a cover of something already extremely powerful. There's something about the world being completely doomed and it never ending up the same again triggers this sensation of despair. It can't be a cheesy song and it cannot be forced, it has to be real, and I think the pieces from the OST is what actually makes this song work really well.
Can't think of much more right now, really."
5723,isfp,"Do any of you guys have a ""problem"" with personal space? I don't like when people get up all close to me (I actually don't think many do) but I mean I don't like when people try to hug me even my family, even more casual but when people put there arm around my shoulder I either push them away or move, also to the point if people sit too close to me I'll move over, idk stuff like that, just wondering if there are any others like me and what th ey think about it"
5724,isfp,"Yeah, I don't mind handshakes or high fives at all. But I get anxious in crowds and generally hate mosh pits or other situations where people are very close or even touching me just by standing next to me. I absolutely don't mind an occasional hug, but only if its from a good friend, close family member or significant other. Hugs from anyone else are rather uncomfortable and if its a stranger I'd freak out."
5725,isfp,"You probably don't trust anybody. Thats the defence because of your trust issues. But you can hug a person. Not everyone of course. Just someone who you deeply like. I mean, when you feel a warm inside your heart. 
For example you work many years in some company. And you get to know some person. You of course start to liking it. You won't probably hang with that person but as a co worker you wouldn't mind to hug that person as you feel ""love"" for the person. Person is cool to you for example."
5726,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and I crave subtext, I feel more drawn to people and have the strongest connections with people who pick up on communicating this way and reciprocate, but I don't come across this that often. Does anyone else find themselves craving sub-textual communicaton? On a side (or maybe related note) I'm also a chronic winker. "
5727,isfp,"It doesn't matter with who I am, or what the topic is, there have been very few people in my life that I've actually managed to have good conversations with. And most of them have been online, with different types. In real life it's like I'm mostly geared towards listening, and it's very hard for me to change that. I usually never talk about what's going on with my life even if it was something important, unless someone asked. I also love my INxx friends but lately I've been feeling quite invisible around them as well. Is it an ISFP thing to be very mentally detached from other people? It's like I need to be in my surroundings 24/7. I'm wondering if anyone else could relate."
5728,isfp,"I relate very strongly to this. Working extremely social jobs has helped turn it around but it is very hard for me to make conversation or stand out at all. As I get older I don't care quite as much about it since I've already found my people and a good place in life, but in my early 20s it was a massive source of insecurity. Get good at getting people to talk about themselves, be kind and friendly, then it won't be such a big deal. "
5729,isfp,"I relate to this so much it's stupid. Even when it comes to things I'm really passionate about, I only have a few words to say. It makes me come off as really boring and detached (which, in fairness, I might be). I'm not sure how to deal with it other than to just distance myself from conversation and stay engaged in my surroundings, but I'm not sure if that's the best strategy "
5730,isfp,"This is me to a tee. I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends that I can have a conversation with. More often than not, I feel like people don‚Äôt care about what I say and I end up getting steamrolled as soon as I want to say something then I never get to contribute to that conversation. I really do feel invisible all the time. "
5731,isfp,"Hmmm there are moments when I appear ‚Äúshy‚Äù, but I‚Äôm basically not shy, just uninterested in talking to certain people. I usually try not to talk if I don‚Äôt have anything of value to say, but also do a fine job of appearing sociable if I want to. But lately I‚Äôve been choosing to stay quiet around people since it‚Äôs been saving me energy. "
5732,isfp,"Yep.... this is hard since I‚Äôm a teacher, but I just say what‚Äôs necessary and then shut up. I feel like anything said that‚Äôs more than what‚Äôs essential, is just ignored. I always feel like I‚Äôm boring or people zone out when I talk too much, so I just keep it brief. "
5733,isfp,"Oh my gosh yes. I'm [22F] only sort of talkative when I have to be, and even then its feels super awkward. 
For some reason I feel it's easier to talk to strangers or people I dont know well and strike up a great conversation than to those I know better as long as they initiated the conversation. I avoid striking up conversations with people I dont know well unless I have to. 
I sometimes even go out of my way to not talk to some people. Not even for any good reason, either. One person I can think of has this very tender and overly sweet personality, and for some reason I can't stand it, and I will literally pretend to be occupied and avoid eye contact with said person so they won't talk to me. I also often sit alone to eat, by choice. It's nice to be alone, completely stress-free. 
It takes me awhile to warm up to people. If I dont particularly like them, I won't spend my time with them. If I like what I see, I'll keep coming back to hang around them and their peers. I have a study group at school consisting if 6-8 people who sit in a designated place on campus. I started hanging around them the beginning of my sophomore year because I had a friend from my freshman year there and it took me all year to warm up to most of them. Even still I still feel awkward around some of them. 
I hate when I cant think of anything to say around people who come sit by me. I feel like I should at least act like I'm interested in them, but I have no clue what to say and I dont feel like making an effort. Then I feel like a jerk but I dont know what to do. 
Around people I know well I'm not like this. I do socialize, but it's not frequently. I don't party or go out much, and I like to do things by myself a lot. I hate depending on people if I don't have to. "
5734,isfp,YES! Conversation is exhausting for me. One of my best friends is in town right now (ENFP) and he talks nonstop. I love him and I‚Äôm usually more open with him than anyone but I‚Äôm exhausted. I dread casual conversations without the influence of alcohol üòÇüò≠
5735,isfp,"Depends. When around people I don't know or don't like I'm pretty much always silent (except when they ask me something or talk to me, but I keep my responses short and to the point).
Around people I know and like, though? I'm almost an extrovert sometimes."
5736,isfp,"Yep I relate 100%. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like talking, I love talking/listening to other people talk about their interests and problems. I just never have the desire to bring up my own interests or problems to other people unless asked about them. "
5737,isfp,The only place i ever have anything to say is on reddit :[ im so silent in real life. Sometimes ill say stuff in my head but it wont make it out of my mouth. Most of the time i just dont have anything to say at all tho Dx
5738,isfp,"Thank you, iliketeatime, for voting on icarebot.
This bot wants to find the best and worst bots on Reddit. You can view results here.

^(Even if I don't reply to your comment, I'm still listening for votes. Check the webpage to see if your vote registered!)"
5739,isfp,"Talking is good if we like you and are engaged in it, but not if we're stressed out, and I'd doubt we'd say why usually. But if we do and you can make us feel better then you'll get like a lot of points. 
90% seems excessive though. Sometimes we just don't wanna answer, or talk, but just sit quietly and watch a movie for instance. Anything sitting quietly is great, lol. "
5740,isfp,"Oh is that good? I thought it was pretty boring because I took her to watch a movie; people usually say they aren‚Äôt good first dates because you don‚Äôt get to talk at all. I‚Äôve been trying to think of date ideas and she really has no preference, at all!
It‚Äôs kinda hard really. Do you guys like going to like museums or exhibits? I‚Äôm a more art kinda guy and I‚Äôm not sure if taking her around to see things I like is kinda boring for her.. "
5741,isfp,"I think E's say that to other E's, but introverted people love movies and they honestly love not talking most of the time. Like anything where they can be more introspective is great. I think we usually don't mind anything cuz we're in our own world anyway, and we probably just wanna be with you and for you not to feel weird with silence. 
I can't speak for someone else, but I've seen a few art galleries and been to a few museums and they weren't very interesting, but I didn't mind. We always amuse ourselves, you know? Maybe those places were just crappy though cuz I usually like art. Just make sure the stuff is good if that's what you wanna do, but again we don't really mind.
Find her interests and do stuff around that if you don't already. She must like something. I'd say being in each other's company is the most important thing for us, and not necessarily what's being done, as long as it's not waiting, I hate that."
5742,isfp,"Well I mean I‚Äôm INFP myself but I have a really bad habit of trying to fill in the silence because I always don‚Äôt want to come off boring.. 
You guys like movies? Then I guess that‚Äôll be good. I really like spending time with her and don‚Äôt care what we‚Äôre doing actually, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll bore her all the time. "
5743,isfp,"So I've recently figured out I'm an ISFP and after reading many descriptions, I'm amazed that they describe me to a tee. Just want to vent to people who may understand me if that's fine.. 
My emotions and thoughts are extremely special to myself and are what I feel really defines me. I can't describe how much my emotions make me who I am.  Because of this I'm often quiet, not because I'm shy like it comes across, but because I only share what I really feel and think with those who I really, really trust and are close to. A while ago, without going into detail, a friend had been able to slowly get closer to me as a person and this person began to become very special to me. I began opening up to this person, which again is very hard for me to do, since my feelings and thoughts are something special to me and I like them to stay with just me. After some time, this person and I became very close, and I was probably the happiest I had ever been. Untill they decided to take what I has opened up and shared with them, and destroy it. They could have been honest with me, but they even lied to me which only made me feel betrayed more. Now I feel like I just won't ever share my thoughts and feelings with anyone, like I never know who I can trust with something so important to myself. So now I've began to almost close myself off entirely from people and friends, not even letting them see a little bit of what's inside me, knowing people will just tear it apart again.
After reading more from ISFP's they often are deeply affected by criticism, and I really agree. I feel like another reason I come across closed off to people is I feel like I'll be judged or critisized for what I feel and think. So I just keep my feelings to myself, and my art to myself who will really appreciate and understand.
Don't know if anyone understands me, or even read this. It just felt good to let something out to people who might understand."
5744,isfp,"I know an ISFP. She seems to be opening up. But I am an INTP, normally I would keep my opinions to my self, but I am opening up as well. So very likely to say something true(Ti) or speculative(Ne) but which also could easily be taken for criticism, which it is not.
Any suggestions? Only one I think I have been using so far is to talk about myself(Si) or my feelings(Fe).  And that seems to keep me out of trouble."
5745,isfp,"Yes, this is quite similar to some of my experiences. One thing I try to do is gain something from other people's perspectives and see their perspectives as interestingly different even if they try to destroy my inner feelings and values. When they do that I distance myself and become more analytical thinking about their perspective.   "
5746,isfp,"Well the ISFP one definitely rings a bell as I've wasted almost a decade through addiction/depression, while I've been chronically avoiding conflict that would enable me to change from my neurotic-tormented self image. I've read somewhere that unahppiest ISFP's are those who are passive - I sure as hell am one."
5747,isfp,YUP
5748,isfp,"I'll have to agree with that last phrase. My unhappiest moments were those were I was completely stalled in life, not doing what i was supposed to do and just watching everything pass by.
I still procrastinate and avoid conflicts and responsibilities all the time, but I feel very happy when I get involved and get stuff done. It's hard to change, but it's something I'm working on and it makes me very happy most of the time."
5749,isfp,"many..many..of the greatest artists have been isfps.micheal jackson.mick jagger,ect ect....anyways how do you as isfps view art?,how does your fi-ni come up with artistic ideas?,also,do you often writ poetry?"
5750,isfp,"While doing/making art can be subjective, I think you shouldn't use logic or rationality too heavily. We're very feely and visual people, so that helps us when making art. I could be making art about a place, a certain experience I had, or a feeling, anything really. Art doesn't really have to come from imagination or reality strictly, sometimes it can be both. Personally I think it's the Fi and the interplay of our Se and Ni that can be perfect for doing art. 
I can say I'm not as interested in poetry as visual art or music. (I also haven't done that many artistic projects as of yet, but I can feel my brain brimming with new artistic ideas.)
(edit: you did ask how I come up with artistic ideas. To that, my answer is don't know. It's heavily inspired by moods though sometimes)"
5751,isfp,"Tertiary Ni coupled with dominant Fi. We don't use Ni as a primary process to get ahead in life, but we play with it. I thought I was INFJ for a long time because my Ni loves to pop up everywhere and use people and things from my life as inspiration for my artistic works, or gives them symbolism (you get the image of Fi colouring Ni?). But I don't trust it too much to make decisions, for example. Fi tends to pour its sauce on Ni waaaay too easily. Se and Te remind me to be grounded in reality."
5752,isfp,"I think creativity is something everyone has, but it can also be cultivated. It so happens we're predisposed to act on the creative impulse when it comes. The same people who think we're like, whimsical art monkeys also wonder how we come up with so many good ideas. It's because we have a lot of practice developing ideas. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. But if you're always telling yourself ew no, this is a dumb idea, or never acting on them, then you never get anywhere"
5753,isfp,"I mean it depends. If your in music have a logical knowledge of theory can really help you. If your a writer you can avoid plot holes and explore deep ideas, using story‚Äôs to show how logical principles play out, and exploring things that would otherwise be impossible. Artists like M C Escher  have used geometry  to creat beautiful works of art. The entire field of Aesthetics is all about using logic and philosophy to discuss the nature of art and beauty. Over all, I can unsustained saying art needs a heavy element of the subjective, but to say logic should be removed from it entirely is reductive.    "
5754,isfp,"A mature ISFP takes care of his/her Ni through Se. That's why I thought I was an INFJ too, because I was being inmature with Ni, resulting in a Fi-Ni loop. Still struggling, but knowing that doing Se activities can save your happiness is really a thing. 
I found that art, nature and hanging out with friends and family just for the sake of it is what makes me a healthy person.
Dunno why the reply followed like this haha (sorry?)"
5755,isfp,"Hello! 
I'm new here. My entire life I always considered myself an INFP and I'm still fairly split between INFP/ISFP. I just wanted to get some outside input on this and see if anyone has a similar situation. 
After my first semester of college as a design major, I realized that while my roommate (also a design major and ENFP) was always focused on finding and explaining deep meanings in her work I just wanted my work to speak for itself and be what it is. 
I've always had this part of my brain in school that wants to find the real world application for everything I'm learning otherwise I tend to tune out and not take it seriously. 
I enjoy extreme downhill skiing- especially moguls and tree runs because you only have to focus on the next thing in front of you and not the entire mountain. I also really love challenging acting roles in theater and have always been known as a great ""in the moment"" actor. I'm impulsive and not very money savvy and I often feel the need to go out and explore by myself. 
BUT I do consider myself an idealist and overthink situations that have happened/are happening/will happen and I'm not very good at remembering small details. Because of this, on online personality tests, I tend to score more N than S. 
I'm torn between the two! Anyone else?"
5756,isfp,"I'm in a very similar situation, I don't really know which one I am.
One thing I'd note is that overthinking situations isn't necessarily an INFP thing. It depends on how you overthink them.
Do you see/hear something and then think of all the negative things that could happen? Are there a lot of ""this bad thing could happen, or this one, or this one...?""
Or do you obsess over one possible negative outcome until you convince yourself that it's probably, and eventually possibly certain? ""When they said that they probably meant x bad thing, which makes sense considering y and they gave me a dirty look earlier""
The first one is more Ne, which would point to INFP, and the second more Ni, which would point to ISFP.
You sound quite Se to me, but a lot of INFPs like outdoorsy activity and a lot of ISFPs don't, so that's a little difficult. Honestly the Ne/Ni/Se/Si functions are what I have the hardest time with for anyone, tbh.
Keep in mind, most online tests are slightly biased towards E and N results. "
5757,isfp,"TL;DR When someone mentions how amazing it was something in the past and how much they would love to live in that period, and you roll your eyes, then, probably, you don't have Si in the stack. If you're the one that prefers to live in the past, then you could be an INFP.
Long version:
A difference I found often is how we go about past experiences and favourite things.
For me, once an event or a relationship ended, it's done. It stays in the past. No thinking about it (specially in a melancholic way), no trying to go back to it. I recognize it was an important and emotional moment maybe, but i wouldn't want to re-live it, nor actually going back in time. It was beautiful, I liked it, but the present and future are way better. INFPs usually tend to indulge in those past moment, idealize it and dreaming of going back to those moments, considering them better than the present they are living.
When I have a favourite thing (or just something I really like), such as movies, songs, places, restaurants etc... I appreciate them and they hold a place in my, uh...top lists?, but I still prefer to watch new movies, go to new places, try new restaurants etc... INFPs tend, instead, to go back to those comforting movies, places...
For what I understand, the presence of Si in the stack makes it so that Si users feel soothed by a known object or feeling, therefore they prefer to re-create those moments.
As an example my ex-bf (which I'm not sure the type but imo he had Si) always wanted to watch movies in the evening, and wanted to re-watch for the 96367th time the same movie. When going out, he suggested to go for the 35049th time to the same restaurant 'cause he liked it and he knew what to order. I felt bored and caged by the lack of change.
The other things that you mention seem shareable by different types for different reasons. For your test results, don't take them too seriously and consider also your enneagram which can give you a particular flavor."
5758,isfp,"So I personally don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm unhealthy. Not hugely healthy, pretty average I‚Äôd say. I‚Äôm mostly quite relaxed and easy going, don‚Äôt get angry or anything. But that‚Äôs about all my life is, just chill and simple.
I want to know how to tell if I‚Äôm unhealthy, and how to avoid this so I can be the best me possible. We‚Äôve all heard in mbti the ‚Äúany healthy type is good‚Äù. Or ‚Äúthis person was an unhealthy xxxx‚Äù. But how do I know which one I fit into? And how can I make sure I‚Äôm on the better side? I want to be just a nice, happy genuine person. To benefit not only myself, but those around me.
I‚Äôve heard a bit about unhealthy ISFPs indulging in sensory things like drinking, but I‚Äôm not sure how much truth that holds, and it really isn‚Äôt a great indicator of how mentally healthy a person (specifically ISFP) is. Any help on the matter is much appreciated, cheers :)"
5759,isfp,"Aloof, indulgent, judgmental, self-serving, can become bitter and resentful. Shuts people out easily and permanently over perceived slights. Reckless and emotionally intense. Sometimes wallowing in self pity and other times very cold and rude.
The bit about indulging in sensory things is dead on, yeah. All SPs are prone to that when unhealthy. Promiscuity, drinking, drugs, etc."
5760,isfp,"To me it really is a combination of how immature they are and also how in touch they are with their unconscious,subconscious,and their super ego.
‚Äã
For ISFPs you have ESFJ Unconscious which would be the easier ones to hack into. whereas the ENTJ and the INTP function stack will be the more harder ones to hack into.
‚Äã
getting into the four sides of your mind can help you communicate better and be better rounded."
5761,isfp,I mean I‚Äôm still pretty young but my wife and I definitely make more than we need. We have very minimal debt and are managing to put her through school without loans. We‚Äôre not at 75k a year but I think people would be surprised at how little it takes to have a comfortable lifestyle with nice things 
5762,isfp,"I've been pursuing a career in medicine for the last 10 years. Half of that was gone to waste because of a useless science undergrad. The other half was to study paramedics, but it's really competitive where I'm at. Thinking of going back to school for nursing and that's another 4 years.
I've always been on the path of science/medicine. Mainly because I'm good at it and my parents pushed me towards it. 
I've always had interest in commerce/entrepreneurship but never found a good idea and have a fear of starting.
What is your e-commerce business?"
5763,isfp,"I can't really explain it but I always feel like things I do/say rub people the wrong way. I'm very sarcastic and blunt and I don't really take anything seriously. and I think people mistake that as me being cold/an asshole when in reality I'm just having some fun. I feel like I have to be careful with what I say or else I might offend someone. But then I'm super boring.
I'm also pretty reserved which people mistake for me being cold."
5764,isfp,"Exactly. I have gotten used to telling people I'm only kidding or teasing so they don't misunderstand. To me, the idea that I would say something like that and mean it is hilarious, and I have to remember that they don't know. So I stay neutral until I know them better. Boring and reserved."
5765,isfp,"Haha yes, but now I'm mostly boring. When I come alive I'm bound to say something that I'll reflect on later that night and wonder if they took what I said in a more hurtful context. It basically comes down to us living in the moment and letting our filters go cause we're not really thinking, just speaking and responding in ways that feel automatic.
Either way it's fun to see op and the other posters describing the same experience I had. "
5766,isfp,I'm basically invisible to most people which I like.  People definitely think I'm stand offish/cold/uncaring which I usually am toward people I do not know or like.  I am also very sarcastic and blunt and it does offend people.  I do have to walk on egg shells around people I don't know very well so I don't offend them.  But people that I know very well get to see the real me.  I'm super fun and love to laugh but only with people that I know.  I hate that about myself.  I can't be funny with people I don't know because I'm afraid of offending them.  
5767,isfp,"Oh yea. I dont always notice it myself in the moment, but lots of times I have been told after the fact that someone thought I didn't like them, or came off as mean.
I have tried to learn from this, but my nature makes me tend to avoid such situations in the first place so that I dont have the opportunity to put into action an attempt to be more interested in others.
I often only chime in with factual statements rather than banter until I get to know someone, which is also the reason its hard to get to know people. Prolly one of the aspects of my personality I would most like to work on since it gets lonely as you age, heh."
5768,isfp,"Holy moly, my life. Swear to god, people think I'm some kind of idiot savant or something, and when they get to know me they realize I'm actually pretty zen and chill, and they split.
My feeling is that the intuitives like people that are broken or twisted in some way, because it's poetic. But in many ways what you see is what you get with me."
5769,isfp,"Yes and no. For instance, I think that we are much more friendly/caring than we initially let on, and I for instance am a lot more critical and analytical then people initially think. The way to get deep and close with us it to spend quality time and endure. There isn't some secret we're going to reveal to you after 6 months that will magically lead to your complete understanding of us.
I think this leads many people to find us boring, but wtf, are the other types some magical bubblegum? Makes me constantly feel like we're missing something."
5770,isfp,"My intp sister answers strongly agree and strongly disagree. She noticed every time I took the test, I pondered over the questions for too long and rarely did a strong agree/disagree. But there are just too many variables Dx"
5771,isfp,Copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste copy paste 
5772,isfp,"What would you guys consider the most suitable ""super power"" for us?
I imagined it'd be something like creating art pieces with a single touch on a surface, or transforming random objects into artworks, or drawing out hidden spirits in different places."
5773,isfp,"I can usually understand people's motivations for doing things or why/what they'd do next. Like a big picture of how their childhood, relationships, interactions, personality all interact together pretty precisely. It's not a super power. Some of my friends call me a people whisperer? i dont think so lol..  I find it pretty annoying a lot of the time."
5774,isfp,Wouldn‚Äôt superpower be something that is supernatural for a person to have? In that case I think a superpower for ISFP would be the ability to always be able to force yourself to see a project though even if it makes you die inside the whole way lol
5775,isfp,"How come this sub is so small, when we are a bigger part of the population than INFPs for example, but /r/infp is 10 times the size of /r/isfp? I hardly ever come across other ISFPs in MBTI chat rooms and forums, even the only facebook group is really tiny compared to other MBTI groups. I know there are several INFP groups on facebook because ours they just get too big to enjoy after a while. "
5776,isfp,"I often read posts here and wish to be more active. It's just that when I start typing my comment, I would see a similar comment and I would stop typing all together because what needs to be said had been posted. 
There are also times when I would see a post that I can relate to or have a lot to say about, and my mind would start working overtime and before I know it I have poured out my heart on an essay. Right before I finish it I would imagine my post being ignored because nobody really understands all the feelings I had about that topic, so I close the tab and go on my merry way. 
Oh and I almost didn't reply to your post :)"
5777,isfp,"I really wish the different types were equally represented online.
Many INFPs on the internet tend to be in a self-discovery, Fi-Si tertiary loop of reflecting on who they are and exploring that, so online forums and studying MBTI are a perfect avenue of endless activity for them.
One of my best friends is an ISFP, and most of his time spent on the web is either research for the competitive video games he's playing or on YouTube looking up stuff that are more in the lines of history and big-picture conspiracy theories. He goes into endless, big-picture research mode that I think are expressed well as Fi-Ni tertiary loops.
That, and the auxiliary function of Se in their cognitive stack lends themselves to be interacting with the world in real-time/physical reality more than other types that find themselves online more."
5778,isfp,"I wouldn't be surprised if there were quite a few people who identify as INFPs that are mistyped ISFPs.  We're very similar, so it can be easy to confuse the two.
Speaking for myself, and I've heard many fellow ISFPs agree with me, I just never know what to talk about :/ "
5779,isfp,"I spent quite a bit of time on the Internet for someone who is described as being more into ""experiencing the real world"" lol. I'm very interested in MBTI but I don't always go on Reddit to read. I like personality cafe and typology central because it's more active though I never post, just lurk. I prefer to read posts and usually someone says something in a more eloquent way and therefore I upvote. Sometimes I comment on posts, but I'm not much of a poster. I feel like everyone has already exhausted some of the same topics and I don't wanna repeat any of them. I'd rather read the discussion than participate in it tbh."
5780,isfp,"I have a feeling it's because we experience the world in our senses so immediately that most of us don't directly seek out information regarding our self-identity.
We're more interested in the pursuit of our interests rather than the ""why we are who we are"" because having Se (Extraverted Sensation), we have a natural affinity with our environment so I'm thinking it's probably why the majority of us don't lurk as much on mbti-related type discussions.
Not to imply that we don't think about our self-identity a lot, we just.. do it in a way where it's more personal to us (our dominant function is Fi, Introverted Feeling, anyway). We'd rather be exploring our self-identity alone rather than dialoguing about them (more of an Fe thing), whether to a friend or on a forum online, ..unless we're directly asked/come to a conclusion that makes us curious about this. It's all about direct experience, Se again.
It's funny haha because when I came across this thread, I feel like.. yes, I'm pretty sure most of us mainly lurk (like most of y'all have mentioned) and we directly soak up the experience by staring at our computer screens, either approving or disapproving but not really feeling the need to 'interfere'. 
Although in normal social terms, our 'interfere' is probably what most think as 'participate' and probably what most of us are already conditioned to think. Though that's not our natural milieu so we instinctively just sit back and watch. Which.. brings us back to lurking!!
I hope I'm not theorising so much but like the rest of us ISFPs, I've been on PersonalityCafe a lot reading about situations that only can be applied to my current life. I imagine it's the same for the rest of us(?)
(if you notice, I use ""direct"" a lot to try to express that in whatever we do, it's gotta be because of us and how it, again, directly affects us xD)
We prefer


not to bring up something which has been already mentioned


to talk about something when we feel like we've gathered enough resources that when we reread it, it must feel like it's explained the whole situation


All this talk has made me realise that.. perfectionism is hard on us because it's extremely difficult to produce something in accordance to the feelings-gasm we want {rofl} when we're not so naturally inclined, functions-wise (Fi, Se), to think of why we feel and think the way we do.
If anything, we know why we think the way we do but it's kind of hard to put it into words when we're soaking up the entire experience and while we're trying to translate all of that to words, it feels like EVERYTHING that we want to explain is just a mere 30% or less, idk.
Our life is a direct representation of our art (note: self-expression). Nothing more, nothing less. We don't explain it much like most types do, we'd rather act on it. Considering how laid-back we are, I think it's possible most of us don't think of MBTI that much to begin with unless we've learnt the direct application of the theory to the world.
Wow, kinda a long post haha. I kind of had an epiphany in the middle And to relate to those who've read this, yeah I feel like I probably didn't explain this properly. (fun fact: it took 45m to re-edit this so that it sounds more coherent) so yes.. it's a lot of effort for us to just post/do something we're satisfied with in the end.
The key is in how satisfied we are with the end-product. If it doesn't feel good enough, then most of us won't contribute. XD And even if we do, we often check back to see if there's anything we can improve on it."
5781,isfp,"Maybe most of them isn't active on reddit but in their arts and craft rooms. Just kidding, maybe in their garage making some space theme music. Honestly, I had more infp friends than isfp, actually I am the only isfp I know in person. Maybe because I hardly socialize with girls. "
5782,isfp,"Personally, i think most of us are lurkers lol i had to actually sign up for reddit to post here, even though ive read stuff on reddit before. And also maybe a tendency to reithink what is written and deciding not to send it at all"
5783,isfp,"The ISFP funtions:
Fi
Se
Ni
Te
You are an introvert so your fi and ni fuctions speak strongly to you. 
In the myers briggs test there are questions that concern dominant N vs S. You guys with such a strong Ni relative to other s types get mistyped as Infps. 
In the face threads, I have observed two distinct camps of eye feels. The warm charming, disarming often brown in colour are the infs. The starkly present in reality, sympathetic, slightly cautious/concientious eyes that are mostly blue are the isfps.
Don't know why there would be colour camps like this, what it means or if it could mean anything at all. I have thought about it quite a bit, but I have no reasonable theory.  
Tldr: Isfps are at the infp sub. Might explain why that sub is bloated relative to infp pop size and ratios seen from other mbti subs."
5784,isfp,"I love philosophy and thinking... I just don't care for philosophising endlessly on irrelevant things. For instance, I hate metaphysics, because there's no real way to push that beyond mere speculation, and I'm not going to change my life based on that in any way.
Epistomology, ethics, and aesthetics are relevant though, so I like them. c:"
5785,isfp,"I like reading, not necessarily books tho and I definitely like thinking (you most likely do too) but ""thinking"" is very vague. 
I've been told I think about certain things on so many different levels that's it's suprising that I can even function without having a crippling anxiety, but at the same time I don't think about many other things that other people think about on a daily basis. Most of my thinking is introspective (your post too indicates some level of introspective thinking, doesn't it?)."
5786,isfp,"Nah ... it's like I ideally want to be organized but don't want to consistently put in the effort.  Every few weeks though, I go into an organization/cleanup frenzy and get everything situated just right... then slowly become less organized day-to-day."
5787,isfp,"I feel like I know less and am less capable than most people. Like a child or a pet. It seems like I miss obvious connections and hidden meanings. I'm floating through life, in a fog, without much of a grasp on what's happening. I don't think I'll ever be an adult who confidently knows what they are doing. My thoughts are only surface-deep observations and my knowledge is limited. I have no talents. 
I could go on but it would be more of the same and I'm sure you get the point.. I'm posting this here because I'm wondering if any other isfp's are prone to feeling this way."
5788,isfp,"I like to say I'm a smart person with a stupid brain. It's like this, I can understand big, complex things given a little time, but I miss the most basic trivial things that any one could realize. My brain works against me and I don't know how I remain smart."
5789,isfp,"I used to feel that way. I think it's one of the negative aspects of being an isfp. It's something you have to actively work on. Pay attention to the ways people react to certain things, learn as much as you can, don't let yourself coast through life. It's really easy to fall into these traps, since we're generally such a laid back and quiet group.  
What has helped me is simply actively thinking about it. ""Ok, I'm in this situation now, how are others responding? What can I do to alleviate any stress or make the situation better?"" Etc. "
5790,isfp,"I can tell you ISFPs... from an INFP perspective, that I see intelligence in everything you are. It's not a demonstrative intelligence but your alignement IS wisdom and it shows in your actions. And that to me is what really matters. Unfortunately, I think other types can be blind to it... For one, depth of feeling is invisible to most people except other Fi-doms. Also, you ISFPs never know the path that led you to an action. It's like you stand in front of what you create and you can't express how it came to be."
5791,isfp,"Yep. I also miss obvious connections- not always social connections- but I just don't connect two obvious thoughts together and look really stupid. Most of the time I don't know what I'm doing so I guess that's why I try to do the same stuff I know how to do. Talents and knowledge on the other hand is different for me. I play different instruments (not amazingly, but good) so I would say that's at least one talent, and I have done pretty well in school and know semi extensive stuff about different topics.
For talents and knowledge like you mentioned, my only advice is to go and take some classes, find a topic that you enjoy.(it doesn't necessarily have to be a school topic/class)  Maybe take a cooking class, or if you have more time try learning the basics of a music instrument, take a photography course, find and learn something even if you never have a career in it. "
5792,isfp,(IxFP) I resonate with this post very deeply. Do you have depression? I know that's a big reason why I feel stupid. Depression can really mess with the way your mind thinks & can really impact your intelligence.
5793,isfp,"Chameleons. 
-Adapt to their surroundings, but still do their own thing.
-Always looking around and getting a feel for things
-When they lock onto something, they get straight to the point
-Just chillin' most of the time
-Doesn't verbalise without good reason
-Colourful and has strong aesthetic preferences
-Takes a special kind of person to know what they're really thinking"
5794,isfp,My ISFP boyfriend reminds me of a cat too. Hes playful when he wants to be but needs a lot of time on his own. He can definitely entertain himself and sometimes I feel like he would rather do that. He definitely loves cuddles though. Hes like one of those cats you have a great bond with. 
5795,isfp,"Does anyone else here get stressed out easily? I know that ISFPs are supposed to be very easy going and carefree, but I find myself getting stressed out at almost everything in my life right now. School work and projects stress me out, my social life stresses me out, and making the tiniest mistakes stress me out. I am just wondering what other people here think. I know that for me, I've had a lot of anxiety issues ever since I pulled myself more out of my head and into the real world (and I kind of miss the days when I didn't)."
5796,isfp,"I hear you.  It can be an ordeal to come out of a low energy, easy kind of lifestyle and begin the task of integrating yourself into society.
About the tiny mistakes thing, that sounds to me like an Enneagram type four attribute.  I feel a kind of mixture of shame and anxiety when I think about all the little things I've done wrong or could have done better.  Even things that, when viewed logically, have hardly any consequence.  Just yesterday afternoon I was really stressing out over a whole lot of those little moments of shame."
5797,isfp,"The only things I am stressed out about are new situations (especially social ones) but the stress is fleeting and acclimation is usually pretty fast. Maybe when getting sentimentally involved with a new person that initial phase is stressy too because of the emotional unrest it brings but that too passes.
I think thats the key.. Everything is fleeting and everything passes so why stress out about it? I live a pretty stress free and anxiety free life, and focus on.. Enjoying the moment and smelling the flowers. :)"
5798,isfp,"I get stressed just by people asking me to do multiple things at once. 
Example: 
Person: Go take out the trash.
Person: Oh yeah, and go do the dishes, and feed the dog.
And once I do get stressed, my body literally locks up. I feel like there's a wall that's preventing me from doing said tasks. It also doesn't help that I'm always working on music when I'm asked to do the chores. Because of this anxiety, it surprises me that I'm very laid back about my responsibilities (typical ISFP behavior.)"
5799,isfp,"It depends. I find myself stressed out a lot, but I'm pretty good at keeping it controlled. I don't express it unless I feel like I need help.
I know exactly what you mean by ""ever since I pulled myself out of my head and into the real world."" I miss the days in Grade School when I could daydream through class about the anime that I wanted to make when I grew up. Now I can't afford to daydream through class, and hardly ever find time to just sit and think. I'm actually doing it right now, but I have to stop because I have to wake up in about six hours for school tomorrow :("
5800,isfp,"I didn't even realize I was stressed out the yesterday until I beat the remote against the couch and almost threw it at my brother when he asked me to mute the TV. Heh. I was over stimulated (it was kinda hot and the TV was getting annoying, plus my family had conversations going on) and over tasked (thinking about a billion things while trying to order textbooks, comparing prices, and right at that moment I had accidentally hit subscribe to Amazon Prime).
That being said, I hardly ever have overt stress reactions. I might get more emotional during stressful periods but not much else. I always have a low simmer of stress, though. I have even developed what I can only classify as a tic because of stress-- once a week or so at random times (not stressful events) my eyes will dart left-right left-right left-right very quickly and uncontrollably. I also tend to have worse sleep when I'm stressed, like most people.
While I think we do have a happy go lucky capacity, I think we can definitely be stressed because we are rooted in reality. We might escape through our hobbies for a while, but those will only offer a brief respite.
That being said, hopefully we can be motivated to get things done and over with since we're stressed about them. ;)"
5801,isfp,"Oh, that also reminds me of all the times my brain decides to bring up all of the little or big mistakes I've done in my life, to which I'll have large cringe sessions where I'll tense up about them.
That, plus my stress, plus my existentialism, all have been leading into a not fun time for me right now."
5802,isfp,"I'm similar to you in new situations. I also panic a bit when I feel like breaking a habit that I've been rolling with for a while. I acclimate to breaking the stress around that pretty quickly, but I will tend to stay consistent in an attempt to avoid those feelings of stress."
5803,isfp,"Whenever I am brought to my lowest emotional lows (super redundancy!), nothing sounds better to me than shutting down my head and potatoing to video games.
Which reminds me of how I was going to be playing Titanfall right now but all of the servers are out... :/"
5804,isfp,"By ""pull myself out of my head,"" you pretty much hit exactly what I mean when you talk about not being able to daydream and having to focus on school work instead of daydreaming.
When I was younger, I was really unobservant and didn't really notice anything except what was going on in my head. Once I hit high school, I started to pull myself out of that so I could focus on school, and it's just not the same as when I was younger. It's kinda hard to explain.
Also, I completely relate with the whole, ""sit and think."" sentiment. My favorite part of the day is the moment just before I fall asleep, as I'm free to wander through my mind for a while before another long day of whatever. "
5805,isfp,"Same here! I love that time right before I go to sleep. It's just so relaxing. It gives me time to think about the things I did today, the things I have to do tomorrow, and then I can just let my mind wander into whatever plane it wants to be in. I almost wish I had a nap scheduled into my day, just to have that moment twice."
5806,isfp,Has anyone gone through this before? I have no friends in the city I live in and want to try and get out there by trying a new interest. There's an opportunity for me to do a sports thing on a weekly basis - but I don't want to socialize until I feel 'good enough' until I feel like other people's judgment won't affect me because I'll be good enough to me. Help?
5807,isfp,"Yeah that's hard. I'm always fighting with myself about this, but it helps if the activity is something I really, really like, or have always wanted to learn. I can ride the wave of enthusiasm for the thing, and by the time it fades, I'm hopefully comfortable enough in the activity or with the people that I forget to care about how good I am. The feeling does come back now and again, but it does get a little easier.
Another thing that helps is joining something where you're not the only new person. Taking a beginner or introductory class can take a lot of the pressure to be good off since everyone's kind of fumbling around together. I realise this may not be up to you in regard to the sports thing you mentioned, but it's a way to kind of desensitise yourself to this feeling/expand your level of comfort."
5808,isfp,"Yes I have!
‚Äã
Can you work out for the specific sport on your own (maybe set a goal of 10 sessions) or watch a certain number of hours of gameplay as preparation (then force yourself to go)? Or, ask people in the sports group if anyone is closer to beginner level or if they have tips or extra time to train with you?"
5809,isfp,"Recently I've been looking into celebrities with the ISFP type. I was pretty hyped to learn that Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and Jimi Hendrix were all supposedly ISFP. Also Drew Barrymore, which is nuts because I totally had a crush on her when I was younger haha. 
EDIT: Also Skrillex! I know he's hated on because of his music, but I've seen a bunch of interviews with him lately and it seems like I can actually relate to him in the way he thinks and speaks, which makes sense because he is also apparently an ISFP."
5810,isfp,"Most of them.  But I think I feel particularly drawn to Lana Del Rey.  Her musical persona, at least.  She could be a completely different person behind the curtain, but I don't care.  I love her songs."
5811,isfp,"For me:
Games:
Action-Adventure/Hack & Slash (think God of War, Metal Gear Rising type games), RPG (mainly oldschool sprite-based ones, but also more action-oriented ones like Skyrim and Fallout), Survival Horror (Silent Hill, Dino Crisis) and platformers (Mega Man, mainly) are my favorites. I'm not really into puzzle games or FPS games.
Anime:
Action, drama, thriller, horror and sci-fi are neat. I generally don't really like slice of life and romance, but there are some exceptions.
Movies:
I only really watch movies for horror and thriller, since they are scarce in anime. Outside of that, a good drama or comedy movie can be nice."
5812,isfp,"for games i like moba or strategy/logic.
when i watch anime is when i'm really bored and have the need to feel something so i like romantic/school life but also like more dark stuff 
and finally movies, i like 90 drama/crime, something along the lines of pulp fiction, the godfather (etc) but i also enjoy terror and animated movies! "
5813,isfp,"I always have a hard time picking favourites when it comes to genres. Style/story/character aren't super important to me, but I can enjoy them. What sticks with me the most though, is the mood something creates."
5814,isfp,"games: i enjoy casual ones (usually with cool art styles), mmorpgs, open ended games, or puzzle games
anime: i like casual slice of life animes, maybe a few action adventure ones!
movies: definitely animated movies, or adventure"
5815,isfp,"Games: Action/adventure, platformers, and JRPG have been lifetime favorites of mine. I'm trying to get into more strategy-based and simulation-based games lately. 
Anime: Shows that have drama, social commentary, or pseudo-philosophical ideas, maybe with some action thrown in for good measure. I also have a soft spot for slice of life. 
Movies: Same as anime."
5816,isfp,"hello fellow ISFPs!
i'm at community college at the moment and aiming to transfer the next fall. i don't have much of a clear idea at all what i wanna do but i just wanna transfer somewhere. so my ISFP brothers and sisters, what did you/are you going to major in?
and for my ISFP comp sci people, how did you feel about the major? is it true that you have to be really passionate about it to succeed at the end of the day? i like coding but i can't see myself at the level of most other students. what were your experiences?
any and all comments appreciated guys! have a great day :D"
5817,isfp,"Honestly I'm surprised at the number of people here on this forum who are pursuing computer science. I thought more would be pursuing arts/humanities. (I know being an ISFP doesn't preclude you from pursuing a STEM career, but it just seemed a bit odd.)
I am currently a nursing major, and I'm trying to stay afloat until the end of this semester :)"
5818,isfp,"Comp Sci Junior here. It's alright, I suppose. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. I'm a little worried about finding a job when I graduate, but my GPA is okay so who knows. I wouldn't say you have to be passionate about it to succeed in CS, at least I'm school. At the very least, at my school anyways, it's pretty laid back compared to other majors, from what I've heard, so it's okay by me."
5819,isfp,"Ex-CS major here! I go to a big STEM school and honestly didn't really know what to do with myself when I found out I got in (mostly because I wasn't huge in academics in high school), but I initially picked CS because of the job security. After a couple semesters I didn't feel like it was a good fit for me and switched to something design/liberal arts related. For me personally, I have to feel at least somewhat invested in my coursework, otherwise I have trouble staying motivated, but YMMV. Getting me to study something I have 0 interest in is like pulling teeth :P
That being said, definitely try out comp sci and see how you like it. It's a great field with lots of opportunities. Every CS program is different and if it's a good fit for you there's no reason you can't succeed. "
5820,isfp,"yo
i am going to be majoring on CS
tho it is not a stereotypical major one would expect for an ISFP, CS is fun, rewarding, and pays very well. I really do not like coding but I like challenges and working with a team. i am doing well professionally with internships and such despite being a shitty programmer.
also at my uni, people with "
5821,isfp,"I love computer science. I'm a current freshman who is almost done with my first year, and so far it's been great! It does seem weird to be so into a technical field as an ISFP, which is what at first dissuaded me from thinking I was an ISFP, especially since none of the tests I took said I was an ISFP (After a long discussion with a few friends, we came to this conclusion). I think what really made me realize why I loved CSC was because of being able to create things and bring them into reality. Once you learn to code, you can do so much and a whole new level of creativity is opened because you can actually make stuff. Plus, even though there is logic and problem solving, you have to think of an efficient and readable way to implement things. Just setting up code is an art in itself honestly, and you develop a personal way of doing things."
5822,isfp,"i got public health as a result for a college major quiz! it sounded great but all the chemistry requirements made me think twice about the major.
so what made you switch? and how are you liking the major? thanks for responding by the way "
5823,isfp,"for sure. but comp sci can easily be seen as a pretty ""creative major"" in some regards like with coding. and i would definitely be willing to consider something in business or humanities if cs doesn't work out for me üôÉ
and nice!! what made you choose nursing? thanks for the reply :)"
5824,isfp,"It's great that you found out what you don't like quickly! As much as we are encouraged to explore, there's just not enough time for that in college and spending too much time on something you're eventually going to leave to pursue something else is something that at least I would probably regret a lot looking back on it.
Which major are you looking into?"
5825,isfp,"That sounds good. Pay and job prospects were important to me as a nursing major. Although CS majors probably earn more than nursing majors, the job market for nurses are as equally good. I remember there was a framed photo in the break room that showed two graduating nurses holding a banner, ""We have jobs."" That never fails to crack me up.
Yeah, for me I like and am very familiar with technology, but coding just makes no sense for me. Math is also hard for me too, which I hear is a huge part of the CS degree. "
5826,isfp,"Far enough, that makes sense when you put it that way. I've played around with python courses and coding never seams to click.
I have always wanted to do something in health care. I didn't consider becoming a nurse out of high school - I wasn't even at a uni that offered it. Only later did I change schools and entered the program. I like that with nursing I can start learning how to work with patients while doing my undergrad, unlike other health disciplines which seem to require graduate training. I like the flexibility of the field - there are many specialties to go into. I myself would like to go into psych -- of course this is subject to change as I go through my program. The pay's not bad, and with more education there's room to do things like becoming a nurse practitioner. 
This semester has been very challenging, but I can honestly say that there's been a lot of growth as well. There's a slow but steady increase of my knowledge base. Also, I am more comfortable working with patients (vs. having no experience at all at the start of the term)"
5827,isfp,"I'm also a CS major. The people that say that are parents, and kids whose parents told them that. There is a lot of demand, but there are also a ton of CS majors nowadays (at least at my school) and it's becoming harder to stand out. That being said I don't really know how hard it is for other majors to find a job. "
5828,isfp,"I'm not sure if this is an ISFP trait but I'm easily discouraged, so doing the programming assignments was tough for me. I had to retake several classes, but now that I'm on to the upper divs that don't have nearly as much programming, I'm pulling through pretty comfortably. As for why I stuck with it, I don't really have any passions that felt compelling to me as a major. There were several times I wanted to switch my major and even mapped out four year plans for other majors, but in the end it came down to graduating later in another major that I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy more, or sticking with CS and being done sooner. "
5829,isfp,"I'm in very much the same boat man! I want to like programming, and am really eager to start an assignment, but actually completing it to the point where it runs and functions is often a daunting task. I've looked into MIS and while it takes around the same time for me to graduate with it, I had no compelling reason to stick with it because even though it may be the ""easier major"", there are still things like case studies and annoying group projects that have to be done. Oh, and the economics courses for it... cringe"
5830,isfp,"I don‚Äôt think BPD is directly related to ISFP type. It‚Äôs probably like, certain types are more likely to develop BPD than other types, but from my understanding, BPD is more related to negative childhood experiences. 
As for myself, it‚Äôs possible I have BPD. I don‚Äôt know for sure because I‚Äôve never been told I have it, but twice I saw it written in my psychiatrists notes (which I only glanced at). I definitely relate to some of the symptoms. I also have anxiety. "
5831,isfp,"I think mental disorders are more likely to influence type than the other way around. MBTI is just a system we've devised to categorise people, while mental disorders are actual, real, physical abnormalities in the brain. 
If we were able to pinpoint the brain characteristics that caused type, then we might be able to determine a correlation and a reason for the correlation, but it still probably wouldn't be a cause.
That being said, there may be data about mental disorders and personality types somewhere, with statistics and whatnot.
EDIT: Found some.
This and this I believe come from the same study, but they're easier to read."
5832,isfp,"Im excited to move in with my boyfriend in February. Im looking forward to everything. Choosing a place, decorating it, having coffee together on a rainy day in it, even cleaning it and all the boring things. Yeah im nervous too because ive never lived with a partner before. But i think we'll work well together and i really cant wait to finally be living with him! Im really looking forward to it."
5833,isfp,"When I first learned about types I learned that my perfect match was an ESFJ. Well it turns out I've been dating one. Took me a while to type him, I thought he was an ESFP at first. Well now I know why we get on so well. He's so affectionate and always gives me cuddles in the park. And he's stayed on despite all the times I've tried to push him away. I'm glad I've finally matured enough to accept ESFJ attention instead of going for the usual chaotic ENTJ relationship that always ends in tatters (ugh). Sometimes I almost feel like he's too good for me. He's a lot less cynical about people than I am, he's just so irrevocably friendly. I feel a bit jelly about that tbh. I hope he never leaves me. I need some ESFJ love in my life. "
5834,isfp,"Reading this reminded me about my childhood ESFJ friend... We do not keep contact as much anymore, our differences in cognition styles showed themselves up more and more (she started expanding her social group, meanwhile I got more introverted). But the time and the bond we had together was something special."
5835,isfp,"I‚Äôm happy for you!
I‚Äôm a guy isfp and have a friend ENFJ who‚Äôs a girl I kinda like but she doesn‚Äôt feel the same. Same as said above she‚Äôs got a pretty big social circle and I like one on one time more."
5836,isfp,"I feel like my fiance is terrrrible at it. I still haven't quite typed her, but I'm thinking esfj.
The other day we were talking about her mom after they got off the phone. She said her mom didn't seem like ahe wanted to do something. I asked why. She said she sounded sad. I asked why she would not want to do it though. She said she just sounded sad. I asked again why would she not like doing thing. 
Almost like my fiance didn't think about why her mom wouldn't want to do something and focused only on the fact she didn't want to do it. 
She also seems to misunderstand people's intentions. She got mad and thought this guy was being a Dick because he wanted to make sure we didn't miss an appointment this time we went because he's a small business and his money flow depends on appointments.
Do you all seem to understand people and their motivations more than others around you? And do you happen to know what cognitive function these seem like in my fiance?"
5837,isfp,"(ISTJ) I do not look for reasons behind things generally.  If you had asked me those questions, I probably would have answered the same as your fianc√©e because you‚Äôre asking for speculation.  Who am I to decide I understand the whys?  And any answer that I give without verifying the truth with my mother, would be pure conjecture on my part.   And it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me to just make up reasons behind actions. Now, I do understand that some types are perfectly capable of reading the signs and trusting their instincts on things like this.  I am not one of them. Ne is my last function, and as such I can‚Äôt trust it‚Äôs input.  So I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs enough for me that I understand that she doesn‚Äôt want to do it.  And in general, I don‚Äôt really care why people do what they do.  I just care what actually gets done or not. 
On the other hand, your fianc√©e is definitely not ISTJ if she‚Äôs taking things like verifying appointments personally.  I think you‚Äôre on the right track (sensor with Fe) in typing her, but I don‚Äôt know why you wouldn‚Äôt just ask her to take the tests.  Typing others is unreliable, in my opinion. "
5838,isfp,"As an ISFJ with a little social anxiety, I can relate to your fianc√©e a little. I can be quite sensitive when it comes to my interactions with other people. I hate to be a bother to others if I sense any hesitance at all. And if someone comes on too strong that can really push me away."
5839,isfp,"Yeah I‚Äôve noticed that some people think more about others. It‚Äôs a goal of mine to understand why people do things and say things, because then I can know them better. I genuinely think that no one in the world is a bad person‚Äîpeople just end up in bad situations and don‚Äôt handle them well. "
5840,isfp,"(ENFP here) Yes, I think my ISFP brother is very good at reading peoples' underlying emotions. He can often tell me what I'm feeling before I can even tell myself. I think I'm better at guessing a person's underlying motivations (thought processes), but he's very sensitive to feelings. Not sure why - maybe a combo of Fi and Se? "
5841,isfp,"Mmm, I'm not sure I'd say I understand people better but I am able to see motive and can always tell when someone is trying to manipulate.  
I do try and look at as much of a situation as I have access to but if I go purely on a hunch I'm almost always incorrect."
5842,isfp,"Isfp here, and I want to know as much as I can about someone! Anyone! I want to know their goals and aspirations. I want to know what pisses them off and I want to know what they live for.  Most importantly, I want to know why!"
5843,isfp,"I've found that people who don't look at others intentions tend to get angry easily, because they have little empathy for why others act the way they do. I don't think I'm making up reasons for other people's behaviour, I think I'm just great at reading people. I make a sport out of it. People are interesting."
5844,isfp,"I‚Äôm actually very empathetic for an ISTJ.  Unfortunately my life experiences (for survival) have made me hyper aware of  other people.  I don‚Äôt think I need to understand why in order to understand that someone is hurt, or lashing out, or angry, or what have you.  I‚Äôm able to react to the results and to me that is the important thing.  If someone explains their why, then I‚Äôm all ears and will do what I can to help them. 
In reality, I hardly ever get angry because I‚Äôm always able to imagine that it could be worse and therefore see the silver lining in everything. 
I‚Äôm happy for you that you are able to read other people so well.  I‚Äôm sure it makes your relationships richer.  Because Ne is my last function,I cannot trust my readings of others, so I actually try very hard to not assign motive where none is given.  
ETA ... FWIW, in my experience, the angriest people are those who mistakenly assume the worst of other people‚Äôs motives. I‚Äôd rather just not. "
5845,isfp,"I basically dislike editing. Is there anyone here who likes it, if so comment below and I will hire you when I get rich. :) Also, reddit with windows phone is irritating. Let's talk about auto correct. Actually I'll just produce my stuff without edits from now on. Why does my phone keep correcting philosophical to philesofical? At any rate, it sounds right. And my phone thinks it's right. haha"
5846,isfp,"Truthfully, I just need an editor. Actually you're right, I'm on the wrong page probably. :) I don't know. Would ISFP'S consider editing creative? Well, my guess is that there's a veritable goldmine of creative collaboration opportunities on this page. That's what it has to do with ISFP. :)"
5847,isfp,"Does anyone else have more reachable/ realistic fantasies when you day dream?
Like, i dont dream about having a mansion in dubai because i know that would never happen so its not that entertaining to think about. But day dreaming about saving up 40K and building my own 800 sq ft adorable cottage with solar panels and chickens in the back yard is so amazing to think about because its so damn reasonable and attainable.
I dont day dream about becoming a famous rock star but i do daydream about performing a few songs in a coffee shop and selling an ep in a tiny record store.
For me, the more i can envision something actually happening the more i enjoy the day dream. Its sort of like, if you can do it you can dream it rather than if you can dream it you can do it for me. Anyone else find themselves with this inclination?
I guess that makes me less imaginative but its just more fun to think about things that are within my means idk :P
Also thinking on it further i really dont WANT to be a famous rock star and have a mansion in dubai. So maybe i just my more minimalist tastes."
5848,isfp,"Personally I separate the ""fantasy"" day-dreaming from planning. Like, it's fun to plan what to do with the money you could get with that job, but I also enjoy coming up with stories and characters in my head. Both are nice and necessary for me."
5849,isfp,"I can't totally relate. I've loved music all my life and definitely want to try my hardest to get music out there, because it's sort of my dream. In that aspect, I daydream really big. In the other things though, I can definitely relate."
5850,isfp,"Yeah, I maybe go as far to say the big dreams are bad for the soul in a way. And there should be clear paths to avoid disillusionment.  
but personally I'm more like"
5851,isfp,"My ideas or even if I watch a lecture - I have such difficulty summarizing what I learned. Or eloquently discussing theories/ideas with colleagues. I find difficulty verbally and slight difficulty written. How can I improve this? Or am I just destined to be misunderstood? For example, I watched a really profound video regarding relationships and spirituality - but you'd have to hit me over the head to get me to explain it well. It's in my head and I got the message, but I can't explain it."
5852,isfp,"I hate that I have this problem but I do! I think so much, but I just cant get it out.  Even little things like talking about the details of my day with my husband, I find it hard to get out. The thing I have found that helps me is if I‚Äôm relaxed, and I‚Äôm confident that the people I‚Äôm talking to won‚Äôt ‚Äújudge‚Äù me (I hate the word judge - maybe have a negative opinion about me?), I‚Äôm much more able to express my thoughts. 
This isn‚Äôt really possible in most professional settings, but what I do with my husband is if something is causing strong emotion - positive or negative - I take some time alone to think it through myself. Then, I‚Äôll have a glass or two of wine (I‚Äôm not a drinker and don‚Äôt like being drunk but just enough to let loose a little), and I‚Äôll discuss with him! Also, I find it much easier to open up while driving with someone - this has actually been proven by psychologists, and it‚Äôs because the person is not facing you, and not looking at you, it‚Äôs less intimidating and judge mental body language and therefore easier to open up! 
It also helps to talk to fellow introverts and people who are not overbearing, so you don‚Äôt feel like you have to compete for a word.
Hope that helps? Lol any other insight I would appreciate as well because going ‚Äúon a drive‚Äù or having a glass of wine with colleagues or your boss is not always an option."
5853,isfp,"You've asked for tips so I'll do my best to articulate what kind of works for me :P I think I get caught up by trying to explain the whole thing of whatever I just found out about. Say i find a cool Wiki entry on a mass conspiracy - which leads me to 4 more. I can read and comprehend it all and love the story it has just given me but when I go to tell someone about it I do my best to link all aspects of the 5 wikis in and my retention is honestly so poor that I get lost in my own story. So choose small quips about whatever you have just taken in that fascinate you the most and think about why you like them in that context so much, once you know why you like those facts or paragraphs so much it makes it easier to remember and link them eloquently. Taking in and seeing the big picture is something we do innately, we get there without an awful lot of logic and reasoning so trying to explain ourselves can defo be tough. 
It also helps to revisit subject matter you enjoy so you can take in more of it. Engage in more content similar to what you just watched to keep your interest up (eg. go take in more videos on relationships and spirituality. The bits that repeat themselves you will remember from before and the new bits will stand out as new.) 
Eventually you can choose to learn about topics linked to those, and you will make connections between those, and the process kind of starts again with learning but you have a base now. Before you know it you'll be able to talk to anyone about that subject. Just keep it concise and focused. "
5854,isfp,"Once you've absorded the material, pretend you're explaining it to someone else, out loud is even better. If you'd actually take that habit for everything and anything, you'd find yourself a lot more in control over your every thoughts. "
5855,isfp,"I was going to suggest the same! I like these videos of experts explaining things at different levels: It might be a good idea to break things down in a similar way, or to re-organise the ideas into a form/learning style you're more comfortable in (a friend of mine does these amazing-crazy spider-diagrams). Personally, I'd at least like to keep notes on ideas/notions, and then organise them later.

But, you might be like me. i.e. a fumbling mess with something I'm not 100% sure of, but I'm very confident and clear when I know my stuff. Practicing teaching things/ creating teaching materials could be an effective way of reaching this point."
5856,isfp,"A while back, we asked folks in this community to take a survey and you all were kind enough to help us out. This post is a high level summary of the results of that survey.
(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term ""extravert"" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, ""extrovert."" )
Introduction
The Movers & Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.
As an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers & Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but ""Phase 1"" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.
Summary
In addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of ""I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself."" The possible answers included, ""Call your phone number,"" ""Send you an email,"" ""Send you an SMS,"" ""Send you an MMS,"" and ""Send you an IM."" We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.
Overall Preferences
Our initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).
Overall Response Breakdown
Granted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. 
Introvert-Extravert Preferences
Breaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.
Introvert Response Breakdown
Extravert Response Breakdown
The similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.
Ambivert Preferences
While ""ambivert"" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.
Ambivert Response Breakdown
Male-Female Preferences
Our original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of ""sex"" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.
Male Response Breakdown
Overall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.
Female Response Breakdown
Gender and Non-traditional Genders
We specifically did not include the word ""gender"" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of ""Prefer not to say,"" and ""Other"" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.
That does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.
Generational Preferences
The first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call ""Millennials"" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to ""alternative"" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.
Millennial Response Breakdown
The age groups that we call ""Generation X,"" or ""Gen X,"" are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.
Gen X Response Breakdown
The age groups that we call ""Baby Boomers,"" or just ""Boomers"" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to ""alternative"" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.
Boomer Response Breakdown
Occupational Preferences
The second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational ""wings"" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are STEM-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  
STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown
Responses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.
non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown
Scenario Preferences
We asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term ""cold to hot"" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.
It is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the ""coldest"" scenario, I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.
Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown
Also, predictably, the ""hottest"" scenario, I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death), included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.
Emergency Response Breakdown
The scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions), the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.
Cool Customer Response Breakdown
The scenario, I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems), showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.
Hot Customer Response Breakdown
Consequences
We were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, ""I mostly roll with it--no big deal"" (16.8%), ""I find it irritating and frustrating"" (24.3%), and ""The interruption negatively affects my work"" (16.5%), as well as, ""I may decide not to reply or continue communication"" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be ""I lose some respect for the person contacting me"" (7.3%), and ""I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'"" (6.5%).
Negative Consequences Response Breakdown
Conversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, ""It helps me manage my schedule"" (14.3%), ""I feel I'm more productive and efficient"" (13.9%), ""I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication"" (21.5%), ""I'm less irritated"" (20%), and ""It reduces my anxiety"" (18.8%).
Positive Consequences Response Breakdown
Conclusion
Our initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. 
Looking at this research, we can see why ""cold calling"" feels ineffective and like ""a waste of time"" to many people. ""Cold emails"" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. 
Yes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of ""emergency"" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.
As an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, ""I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency."" And, another comment, ""I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious."" These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. 
Our research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not why things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?
All of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.
We will begin ""Phase 2"" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers & Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please contact us; but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.

5857,isfp,"So, about an hour ago or so, my boss at my internship (ESTP) flipped out at me in a really nasty passive-aggressive way for browsing reddit (which is odd, since he never minds it, and I've been working all day) at the last 5 minutes of the day. This kind of behavior kinda scares me at first, but once it's over I'm the one who gers angry. 
So, that got me thinking, everyone seems to have certain habits when they are angry. My boss calmly, but in a really serious tone basically asks you ""what are you doing?"" and then once you give him an answer he pretty much verbally tears you apart in a passive-aggressive way, and tells you to continue your work. In my case, I am usually in some sort of shock at first, I get shaky and I'm some sort of scared, and after that I get really grumpy and start having thoughts in which I'm beating up the one I'm angry at, or think of ways to get revenge. I also pretty much completely ignore them when they say something, unless it's important, in which case I just reply curt and professionally. Outside of that, I try not too look grumpy or angry, because in my experience that will just make them point it out and continue harassing you. I can't muster a happy face either, so I just settle for a neutral face."
5858,isfp,"I've noticed some of the other personality types have no issue blowing up at you and then the next day it's like it never happened. That's the part that bothers me. Don't act fake with me if you have beef with me! And while I respect authority and care what my superiors think, I don't like being snapped at or micromanaged (who does, really?). The thing is, sometimes they're not being fake ‚Äî they just get over it quickly. I, as an ISFP, don't get over it quickly! I want to talk about it. I want to find the solution. I want to get back in their favor. For example, in your case, I'd be happy to have a conversation privately with my boss and explain myself. I would want to be understood and not have the worst assumed about me. I'd want them to see my heart and I'd want to relieve tension. I don't like being blown up at because it makes me resentful and I analyze the relationship obsessively. I'll begin to hold a grudge. I don't like burying things!"
5859,isfp,"I react pretty much the same as you. I don't show it much, but people feel the angry tension around me. I get very shaky, I sometimes get teary eyes, but I mostly mutter to myself and bottle it up until I can't anymore and I hurt myself either physically or by ruminating. (It's not a healthy way to cope, but I haven't been that angry in a long time)"
5860,isfp,"i dont get mad a lot, i‚Äôm usually able to control myself. but when i get mad i get like mad MAD lol. i usually come off as a different person like i‚Äôm usually kind and willing to agree to disagree but when i‚Äôm mad it‚Äôs the complete opposite and i become pretty aggressive in my tone"
5861,isfp,"For me it takes a lot to get me really angry. I don't like to waste my energy getting worked up when I can calmly acknowledge it and move on. I like to think I'm a pretty patient person. When I do get angered especially in a heated argument I'm probably going to be crying because I'm SUPER sensitive. In therapy I learned that my personal anger styles are:
Hidden styles
‚Ä¢ Avoidance ""I don't get angry""
‚Ä¢ Sneaky ""you can't make me""
Explosive styles
‚Ä¢ Sudden anger ""I have a short fuse""
Chronic styles 
‚Ä¢ Moral anger ""I fight for what is right""
I've also never experienced wanting to seek vengeance and I don't think I would ever want to have revenge no matter the circumstances. I've never wanted to hurt anyone, not even when it might come natural in ones head when someone has really made them angry. 
I'm someone who needs to communicate and compromise in relationships, so when I'm in a fight its important to me to find that common ground. 
The worst fights I've ever had are with my mom, she is someone who gets under my skin and fires back whatever she wants to win an argument and to make you feel smaller if you've said something that has hurt her. With her it's super hard for me to turn away  right when things start fusing. I've gotten better but she is the only person who has ever made me that angry, its probably why I hate getting angry in the first place."
5862,isfp,"Reading comments here helped me feel a little better about my anger ‚Äúissues‚Äù (let‚Äôs be honest here, it‚Äôs not an issue, it‚Äôs everyone else who keeps stepping on toes with the issues). Normally I‚Äôm approachable, kind of goofy, not-taking-things-seriously kind of way, but I take pride in my work and see that it gets done.
Admittedly sometimes this somehow hints to my (ex-)boss that he can push and demand as he pleases, and I do try to accommodate these things as much and as best I can. Till he gets in my face and throws blame around. I let him have it, cranked up to 11.
I wasn‚Äôt fired though, he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me and couldn‚Äôt look me in the eyes even in the hallways. But damage done, everyone was afraid, even my coworkers, whom I never once lashed out at. I left on my own accord eventually. Still, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem since it‚Äôs how I processed breaking point anger, and everything before that was reasonable if not beyond so. All the advice I‚Äôve sought since is more to do with letting people know I‚Äôm stressed out by signalling that, you know, before I tear into someone. But it‚Äôs so very difficult, I only have two settings of ‚Äúfun‚Äù and ‚Äúunreasonably angry‚Äù."
5863,isfp,"I am an isfp also and usually when i am angry in general i tend to be passive aggressive but if i am extrememly angry and had the anger for a long time i become outwardly aggressive. My preferred attack in this state is verbal because if i feel a certain way i want the world to know about it especially the people i am mad at. Theres only been two times i remember in recent years that i reached an extreme state and it is not a good place to be. It's similar to the severe ""under the grip"" stress because it makes you take on negative traits of ENTJ which is the complete opposite of ISFP but you may have to be under the influence of other things such as a stressful event like sudden homelessness, no support group, etc. to have this happen to you but everyone is different."
5864,isfp,"I pretty much warn people to stay away because I know I can get pretty scary when I get mad. I will get physical, my sense sharped and I will start directly cursing at you with no mercy. People labeled me as a hothead Lol. I would try to calm down by deep breathes or take a lap around the school tho but most of the time I would get more angrier ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Lol and yes I did flicked a girl off because she pissed me off when she keep telling me to get off the game about 5-6, she put her anger on me when it's just a hockey game and I was a newbie. My friend tried to calm me saying ""No harsh feelings, it's just a game."" And I would cool a little. But, I was enjoying the game so I didn't care about winning or losing. When she could have did the right thing and try to teach newbies. Eventually she tried to bully me lol saying ""haha you guys keep losing-"" That's when I lose it for real and I smacked her with the hockey stick hard on her hip and told her to f*ck off. And her expression was priceless, close like this ---"
5865,isfp,"Yes!! Normally I genuinely get along with everyone, but once someone pushes me to anger, I basically rage. It‚Äôs super rare, and it‚Äôs usually because someone is being severely mistreated, but once I‚Äôm angry, I‚Äôm ready to fight lol. 
   We‚Äôre Americans, but we‚Äôre stationed in Japan. A couple weeks ago, this bitter old dude was SCREAMING at this little kid (we live next to a preschool and this kid was no older than 2 or 3) and the kid would cry and he would slap him in the face repeatedly and scream at him more, and I was getting soooo frustrated, because I can‚Äôt speak Japanese, and everyone else was just walking by. But my natural impulse was to chuck something at this old dude and/or fight him to make him, but I have to restrain myself because anything bad that Americans do on island looks bad on all Americans. But I just remember literally throwing down everything I was holding and pacing and clenching my fists. So yeah, I‚Äôm not naturally an angry person, but I definitely have some mama-bear rage that‚Äôs kind of difficult to control."
5866,isfp,"Passing INTP here- 
What little LoL I did play, I usually preffered to play defensively as a mid-lane mage, like Annie. 
In Overwatch -- if you count that as close enough to a MOBA -- I often end up playing a tank, like D.Va, Orisa, or Roadhog. I think intuition helps to read the situation and know if you need hold a strategic choke point until back-up arrives, or if you should fall back. Sometimes keeping the enemy from getting dug-in at a good spot is more important than finishing off kills. "
5867,isfp,"I‚Äôm trying to work out my personality type and I‚Äôve gone through my cognitive functions and stuff and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm an ISFP. It seems to fit pretty well except for two things: tradition and commitment. I‚Äôm okay with things being progressive however, as a Catholic, I value tradition as well. I also kind of like structures since they help me be more productive when I would otherwise waste my time (like school schedules). I also really value commitment, especially in relationships. Are these breaking points for being an ISFP?
EDIT: I also get ‚Äúvibes‚Äù from people. I don‚Äôt put TOO much stock in them, but I get them nonetheless. Ahh this is so complicated to figure out!"
5868,isfp,"I believe you think of the types too much as stereotypes. Yes, it is okay to be an ISFP and value commitment and tradition, but not merely because ISFPs tend to be loyal and value their friendships highly, but because this is what most of humans do. Even as an introvert you still need good people around you to give you energy.
And when it comes to tradition, I think everyone who can understand the value of it can respect it, regardless of their type."
5869,isfp,"It's ok to not fit your type's description %100. But if %80 of it sounds like someone secretly has been listening to your mind for your entire life, then you know that's the one. /u/ravetildawn said it right, we're actually very committed people, but we're just very picky with what we chose to commit to. 
As far as traditions, I think there's a part of us that can chose to go upstream and completely against a trend/tradition/standard when we can't get un board with it. And we rebel in our own style, doing it differently, as the inner artists of lifestyle comes out."
5870,isfp,"     Okay, when it comes to commitment: ISFP‚Äôs are really loyal, and expect the same from others. I find I take my relationships (family, good friend, or romantic) seriously but, only when I see them as a potential to be serious part of my life. When I have those friends from class/work, that I never see outside of there, I could care less about them.

     As for the traditional part, I‚Äôm not sure how to quite answer that. I can say that I do follow certain traditions, that I like to keep mostly because they‚Äôre ones my family has, not me personally.

   I hope this helps at least a little! (:
"
5871,isfp,"Not great. He was kind of an asshole in my teens so at the time I withdrew from my relationship with him. On a number of occassions he really hurt my feelings, and I absolutely did not want to put myself in a vulnerable position with him again. We lived together and shared about five words in two years. Perhaps it was immature of me, but I was a teenager. He was a grown man. 
I'm an adult now. Neither of us have made an effort to repair the relationship. I barely see him, and when I do it's terribly awkward. He feels like a stranger."
5872,isfp,"It feels like we are both from different worlds. It's funny, we get along really great when it's just me and him. But when were with other people, we piss each other off. I think we both have a desire to control the mood or atmosphere of the room, and when he takes it in the wrong direction it pisses me off like nothing else can."
5873,isfp,"I have such a hard time getting out of bed. When I manage to, I move at the speed of a zombie. Probably takes me 2-3 hours to get ready. Mentally preparing myself for the day ahead and trying to wake the hell up. Thank you for coffee!"
5874,isfp,"I found it difficult this morning because it was very gloomy out, but normally, if I‚Äôm given 5 minutes after waking up I can literally be seen singing and dancing and very bubbly! I can be that annoying person first thing in the morning... it seems weird for an ISFP, but that‚Äôs me! "
5875,isfp,Oh my god relate to this. Yes. I can almost only do one class a day and early classes are soooo hard for me to manage because I love the feeling of a  well-rested sleep combined with a slow and rejuvenating morning. I‚Äôm actually trying to keep this in mind and set my alarms at least an hour early before I have to leave my apartment so I can have that necessary wake up time 
5876,isfp,"I have a slower rhythm than most people today. I usually take hours to get out of bed (even when not depressed, I just wake up and browse Reddit, or do crossword, sometimes I read a book too). Can't function before at least 10:30 AM. I can't keep up with a busy schedule because it sends me into depression and mental breakdowns after less than a week. I'm unable to conform to a ""conventional"" schedule, today's world moves way too fast for me and that's one of the reasons I wouldn't be able to keep a 9-5 job. I'd rather work part-time and have little money. Coffee helps but if I get up earlier than 9 AM, I feel depressed as fuck no matter how much caffeine I consume."
5877,isfp,"Not just mornings. I had class in the afternoon today, and even though I had gotten plenty of sleep I was still EXHAUSTED getting up.
I think I just have an issue with getting up to go do something. I hate doing things.
Blah."
5878,isfp,I started going to the gym and this problem became a lot easier. But then again I started on Spring Break and getting up was easier on Spring Break. Now I am back at school and Monday was just the same as before. 
5879,isfp,It depends. If I have any obligations that morning I absolutely jump out of bed landing in my clothes ready for war. If I don't have anything to do though. It takes me forever to get my ass moving. If I don't have a plan I have to think good and hard about whether or not anything I could be doing in that moment beats sleeping a few more hours.

5881,isfp,"I see a lot of posts that I'd like to offer my 2 cents on, but can't quite estimate what stage of life OP is in. Because you don't want to give a 17 year old the same advice you'd give to a 25 year old. I think this would be a very productive new rule. Asking for advice on the internet isn't as straightforward as people think. I truly appreciate seeking advice from people who view the world from a very similar lens, but without some details about the person's specific situation, I think those posts can not foster a healthy and productive discussion where we can all learn from each other.
What do you guys think?"
5882,isfp,"Why wouldn't you give a 17 year old and 25 year old the same advice? In many cases they probably could both apply the same advice, depending on the situation. I think people make too many assumptions about others based on age alone, so I don't normally tell people my age unless it's relevant, which it usually isn't. People don't always neatly fit into ""life stages"" boxes. It also greatly depends on which country they live in. "
5883,isfp,"hey guys! the hubs and I have a great sex life at least from my perspective. hes never said anything contrary to that and definitely expresses enjoyment. we didn't have sex until we got married and were virgins before marriage. 
he is very giving during sex and will work pretty hard to ensure i climax before he does. but i'm nervous it's too much work and makes sex unenjoyable for him. i don't have to put nearly as much effort in to satisfy him.
i suppose i will talk to him about it if i get too worried but i thought i would get some insight on isfp guys sexual tendencies as far as what makes them feel especially satisfied and loved. thanks for any insight you can provide."
5884,isfp,I'm a confirmed ISFP male and from what orangecat said ^^^ she is spot on. Just ask us what we like. I myself rather please my significant other and get pleasure from doing so. We just want to make sure you're happy :) 
5885,isfp,"Hi! :)
My best friend is an ISFP (pretty sure); I suppose I'd just like some insight into their type. What do you think of INTPs? Where do difficulties/misunderstandings spring up when the two communicate? "
5886,isfp,"I don't really know how to answer these questions since I truly don't believe ""an INTP"" or ""an ISFP"" is a solid, empirical thing. However, given my test results as an ISFP and the grouping of people I have met who test as INTP or seem similar (including my mom) then I have some opinions on that schema.
INTPs that I've known fit a few different patterns. On one hand, there are extremely chill INTPs who can appreciate something about me and I can appreciate something about them. Even still, there are (for me) frequent conflicts because I am bad at speaking their language and they are very poor with meeting people at their level or just not acting superior in certain ways. I know it's strange to say about INTPs but they can be very socially elitist and it's even more difficult to challenge because they have already proven in their heads it's the way it should be.
Other INTPs are so far in the stratosphere I have felt we only relate to each other in very unspoken ways. That said, when there is a history or a common interest to bond us, it can feel like we are two lines of an asymptote and the space where we are close to meeting but never really do can feel really beautiful to me- but then, I never know if they feel the same way.
I think there's also a third kind who are just beyond quirky and might even seem a bit insane to other people, like kids in college classes who look like they might talk to themselves in awkward moments or something, but then they speak up and always have something insightful or interesting to say. I always find these people interesting but never actually talk to them and I don't know if they even register my existence.
Wealthy science nerd INTPs are basically the noble lords of our day and age and they mostly do their job very well without considering the broader socio-political implications of their output, and have already determined my intelligence and are looking for someone else who understands their brilliance instead of talking to me, but in the politest way possible. 
Ok, one more. I think there is also a kind of INTP who belongs to a more unique social group or identity and they can adopt ISFP-like aesthetics or interests, but once I try and actually engage in conversation with them I feel like nothing I say relates to their interests. "
5887,isfp,"My mom might be an INTP, however I haven't completely figured her out yet. She could be ENTP.
Some misunderstandings we have is that since she's my mom, sometimes I go to her with my problems. She's very good at giving me solutions and an optimistic outlook, but that is not what I want when I talk to her about my problems. I want validation; to hear, ""that sucks"". Otherwise, we communicate well."
5888,isfp,"I don't know one but they sound incredible :D I think people who have the Ti-Fe axis are adorable; they hide their feelings behind harsh words but they are very loyal to the people who matter and really interesting.
I'd say, since we're pretty sensitive, but tend to hide it VERY well, we can be hard to decipher. Especially when the ISFP has not developped much emotional intelligence just yet. Se-Ni is required to make sense of the world, I think both on people and on ourselves. But then Ti is really good at making sense of things right ? :P
The difficulties could therefore stem from a lack of sensitivity toward feelings in general from the intp (possibly without knowing where they hit hard), and misunderstandings on the ISFP's part (because of Ter Ni). Fi-Ni makes us sure of ourselves sometimes; but when we're offended, it's due to a lack of self confidence and something we already felt at least somewhat bad about. We tend to beat ourselves up easily because of that inf Te. But we can be easily convinced back with rational argumentation, even if it does not look like it at first.
An important part might be to not try to manipulate and to stay honest; or else ter Ni might make the ISFP mistrustful. Haha I know much more on the ISFP part than the INTP one. Sorry about that ! Nice to hear you befriended one of us though :)"
5889,isfp,"Disclaimer: Im fairly new to MBIT, i test INTP and over the last few years i have been working on (what turned out to be) my inferior Fe function. I asked her to take the test and she got ISFP, so AFAIK she‚Äôs only taken in once. 
Backstory: We‚Äôve known each other online for 8 years now. First 2-3 years we were inseparable best friends. Then we had a falling out due to feelings getting involved, high IRL stress on both sides, and us just having very opposite functions while being young and immature about it. 
Last 5 or so years we‚Äôve been through varying degrees of closeness. 
We‚Äôve slowly been talking more and getting closer again over the last year but honestly things are still just a shadow of how we used to be, and we both feel that and hate it. We‚Äôve both expressed to each other that we miss each other and how close we used to be. But then that's it, there's no talk about what we want to do to fix that nor do we actually do anything. 
She‚Äôs been going through some hard times IRL and i want to be there and be supportive for her. Even though im trash at it, Ive been trying my best through the limited communication we do have (text/snapchat). To be honest though it feels kinda off, forced and not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for us. It feels scripted and like its what we should be saying to each other. Our ‚Äústyle or rapport‚Äù feels like its rarely there.
We used to play tons of video games together and skype call for hours to spend time with each other. Problem is i have weird feelings about both those things atm. 
Video game wise i just came out of a pretty long depression where i used video games as a huge crutch. My competitiveness took a lot of the fun out of video games and i found myself feel more angry than relaxed.  I still love them, just been pretty burnt out. Especially multiplayer games. 
When it comes to voice/video chat, its just something im very nervous and awkward about. Last time we had a falling out a couple years ago, one of the last straws before we fell out was her standing me up on a couple phone calls we planned. On top of that she tends to distance herself whenever theres a lot of emotion going between us ( she denies this lol). Especially if accompanied by other IRL factors causing high stress. A general pattern i noticed over the years is high emotions + high stress = distancing 
TL;DR Im trying to reconnect with a long time ISFP friend/crush but im having a hard time due to fear of repeating past patterns. I want to continue to be supportive while shes going through current IRL issues but we both also both miss each other and want to be closer. 
Any tips on how to go about this? What can i ask, or how do i go about asking it so we can both understand each other better, in order to accomplish these things? "
5890,isfp,"I'm sorry to hear about your problem. Since you two are still talking and want to rekindle that old spark, just remember its not hopeless. 
Im an ISFP with an INTP best friend with whom have been practically inseparable for the last 10+ years so I hope I can help you. We discuss IMBT types and how they interact for years so here we go. 
You said your working on your inferior Fe, I'm glad you know about function stacks, makes things easier to explain.
The BIGGEST thing is COMMUNICATION. When you can, try to talk about how she feels about specific events and how they relate to the bigger picture of your relationship. Then once she is open to communicate about this difficult topic, also bring up how you think about the situations without devaluing her feeling. If she thinks you are questioning her feeling or intelligents, she might close off. Remember that she lives in a foren world to you, responding and reacting to everything to how she preserves it to be. Rather then how they really are. Calmly explain (might need to be restarted in different ways) how you perseved the event and how it affected you. If its an action she did that hurt you  (like standing you up for a call) explain that it hurt and ask how such an action would make her feel. Appeal to her Fi.
If you two live close enough, try to go out and do an activity you both enjoy, positive events will help build the trust again. 
If she starts acting upset, take note, and try to get her to start talking about her emotions. Explaining the upsets takes it out of the abstract and helps it be real. That will give you both  information of whats going on in her mind. Its hard for us ISFPs to articulate whats going in our minds so be patient. If you can give her the tools to understand how to explain it. There are plenty of videos on how ISFP and INTP function togeather. 
ISFPs tend to isolate, for days to months at a time if its really bad. Dont take it too hard, its not agenst you. Its just something we do to rearrange our minds and also when we get stuff done. Under stress, its a copping method to build up the energy for the next task. 
Thats already quite the text wall, sorry. If you have more questions or something I said didnt make sense, let me know and ill try to answser/ clarify it.
Best of luck with your friend. These kinds of relationships can be magical!"
5891,isfp,"Yea I read them lol. Just wanted different or more opinions based off of my details I guess.
Idk if that's the case but purely from a MBIT point of view it makes sense that there are common and frequent misunderstandings between the two types. "
5892,isfp,"This is the part that i understand but am confused about at the same time. Days at a time i do myself all the time, 100% understand, no biggie. Its when the days turn into weeks and then all of a sudden its been months. At that point it feels more like a change of heart, or a decision was made and not just a temporary coping mechanism. Thats my struggle though i guess. 
Thank you for taking the time to write this all out though, its incredibly helpful.  I try my best to  be more mindful and proactive on these kinds of thought processes. "
5893,isfp,"(inb4 : sorry for my broken english)
‚Äã
But you should post in a more general subreddit, your story is not a MBTI thing. Trying to reconnect with a long time known person... it's not easy. It requires a lot of patience. I've been through what you describe, and I know that it can be frustrating... the great beginnings and the fade out. I deeply think the best in this case is patience. But you're talking about someone you've been knowing for 8 years, so I don't know... like you say if you force it, it won't work. It has to be natural, you have to enjoy it without ulterior motive. So if I were you, maybe I'd talk to her a ""last time"" (?), tell to her that I'm available if she wants to talk or something like that - but maybe you already did it - and then I'd stop talk to her for like, 6 months at least ? And then come back. Time can sometimes regenerate relations. Sometimes not. It ain't easy to keep alive a virtual relationship. Have you ever meet together IRL ?"
5894,isfp,"My INTP friend said that the decision could be fear based. Fear of upset, of people. Its what she has absurved in me. And she is right. With the more time passes, the harder and scarier it gets to open up communications again. ISFPs get scared and forget the good times, the understanding, and just see angry people cause we were too scared to say anything sooner. Coupled with any form of anxiety and depression and its a bastered to move past. 
Im glad I could help, and i wish you the best. 
Good luck to you friend"
5895,isfp,"I lost it at 20 and I did it when I felt ready! I didn't feel like I missed out on any knowledge and I feel like the same person as I was then, I just have a different way to express. I look down on people who shame others for virginity."
5896,isfp,"Mormon is Christian sorta? I have this girl and she‚Äôs like very low religious in Islam. She‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt wear a headscarf etc but was wondering if she also does a thing with no sex before marriage. Cause that would suck haha.
Thanks for elaborating :)"
5897,isfp,"Most religions have rules against sex before marriage, so I would say yeah there probably is some of that.  It just depends how deep she believes in the religion.  Religious trauma can go deep, even if you arent actively religious."
5898,isfp,Inner qualities do matter and I think they would reflect on the surface. But I do pay attention to physical beauty. I like well dressed and well mannered (but open) people. I want to feel easy and confident in their company to enjoy their beauty. 
5899,isfp,"i've seen something like this on the mbti sub (which was very generic & general lol) but i guess i just want to know what my fellow ISFPs instagram feeds look like. if you post at all, anyway xD
mine consists of:
-scenery & nature
-food
-animals
-pics with friends
and no selfies...
what about you guys?"
5900,isfp,"Hm, Mine has most hooping videos, travels, and my cooking/baking. I very rarely ever post selfies. As an artist and former photographer, I do like to try to play photographer take creative photos haha."
5901,isfp,"It's highly dominated by food photos. There are also some pics of sceneries, exhibitions, seasonal decorations, the neighbourhood stray cat(s), and a few pics of my dolls before I decided to make them their own account."
5902,isfp,"Thank you! I have another private one with much crappier pictures, which includes more stuff with friends and my cats and selfies and random stuff.
Mostly I hate how everybody just seems to be desperate for engagement and follow other people with the hope of them following back and leave comments with no real substance to try to get noticed. It just feels really superficial. I get it though, because it can be difficult to get your stuff seen. I tried playing the game for about a week, but I didn't have it in me to continue. I'm still going to post, but only if I have something I find worthy of sharing, and only for me."
5903,isfp,"When I want something I want it now. It keeps me up at night, like right now. 
Me and my girlfriend are selling our car, and buying a new one, and I want it all to happen now. Its 1:30 am and I should be sleeping but I was trying to upload the ad for the car to the marketplace. My girlfriend said before she fell asleep that we should do it tomorrow instead so we could do it properly, and I understand her logic. But I want it to happen now. Now I can't get the images to upload, so although I hate it I'll wait till the morning, and then we can also find some more info about our car to put in the ad. 
My whole body is itching with this. Why? I don't understand. I see the logic that it can't all happen right away and its better to take it slow but still by body is itching with wanting to get a new car ASAP. If it's possible why not now. 
Can someone tell me why I might feel like this? It's not just now with the car. It's all things. Am I too materialistic. Scared that my interest will change? Unrealistic? Impatient??
I hate this feeling! It's a physical feeling "
5904,isfp,"Is it feelings of anxiety? Maybe you want to get it done as soon as possible because the waiting game gives you stress and negative feelings associated with all the potential outcomes of that action. 
Remember you brain and very connected to your body. Emotions aren't always rational, so what you think can definitely translate to the physical feelings you're experiencing. Self-talk can help discipline your mind to think more positively, which can influence your emotions."
5905,isfp,"Do you feel like you cant relax and let you mind free flow naturally like usual? It gets really tiring being fixated on a single thing, when I cant do something that I want done right now I just start to imagine step by step how I would complete the task and possible outcomes. Its a nice distraction and makes you feel like you arnt wasting time doing nothing but preparing the best you can that will (in reality, just might) lead you to a better outcome. By imagining the outcome you may feel like the task is already complete and frees up your mind. "
5906,isfp,"This is why having a sturdy routine can be so tempting. . . The amount of times I've settled for shitty, easy to get jobs just because I'm fed up with the job application process. I just figured it was ADD, or the internet warping my brain.  
But +1 to supportivepistachio. I just wanted to vent rather than be all useful and understanding and supportive.  
I remember when the mud guard on a mountain bike I had kept coming out of line, and wondering off to the side. A sensible, together sort of person would undo it to take it off, or tighten it up. I just ripped it off. Could not be fucked with it, was doing my head in. I don't know why I didn't turn out the calm, considered sort.  
Yeah, I get how the irritable impatient-ness is a physical thing."
5907,isfp,"So, Lately I find myself walking by certain places and the first memories that come to mind is of ideas/daydreams I had while walking on those same places. Some sort of deja v√∫ like ""I had that idea/ I imagined that in here"", does anyone else have this sort of thought?"
5908,isfp,"OMG I thought I was the only one! I do this a lot. Like when I talk on the phone I'll be looking at an object whilst thinking/talking and after the conversation I'll look at the object and think ""oh I remember I was saying/thinking this while looking at this object"" lol"
5909,isfp,"yeah I do this sometimes, I have a lot of memories of certain places. It was interesting to live in an apartment complex when I was very young and them move back ~10 years later. it was renovated and the area it was in sort of gentrified, but there were still lots of things that were the same as they used to be"
5910,isfp,"Yeah I do that to! The going back to places you were as a child is so crazy, all the memories come rushing back! 
One particularly weird one I had was at my grandfathers farm. It‚Äôs particularly large farm and there are some places on it which are pretty hard to get to. There are a few hills which are surrounded by plains. On the horizon you can see other hills and some ranges poking above the plains. You can‚Äôt seem them without climbing a hill. Anyway so I kept having this reoccurring dream which was always slightly different but always had the same range of hills in the distance but I didn‚Äôt take notice of them in my dreams. I assumed they were just random and never connected them together until after. By the age of about 18 I decided to try to get to a part of the farm which is hard to get to, and to my surprise on the horizon there was that exact hill range from my dreams and they all come rushing back in an instant. It was a really bizarre experience. I just stood there in shock for maybe 10 minutes, replaying all the dreams I had long forgotten. I still can‚Äôt remember ever seeing those hills before but."
5911,isfp,"Not what your favorite songs are, your pattern of playing the songs you like, etc. fuck that, don‚Äôt care.
When I hear a song I like, in a moment, I immediately associate it with all the beauty I see in that moment. Music is truly the thing that defines all the best moments of my life. I associate songs with visuals and activities.
For example: I‚Äôm a snowboarder... if a song is playing in an awesome Travis Rice video, if I hear that song a month later, I immediately think of snowboarding.
The song I heard when I first saw the Northern Lights in Iceland was Bon Iver ‚ÄúHolocene‚Äù. So when that song comes on... I could be in the gym, driving around a city, it doesn‚Äôt matter the surroundings... emotion comes over me and I‚Äôm immediately back in that place, and I can visually picture that moment.  
I‚Äôll be hiking through a forest in France, and when a certain song that played when I was in Korea 2 years ago on top of a mountain I immediately remember about that moment.
Bottom line, I‚Äôm wondering how music relates to your senses and the moments you hear it and how it associates with you. "
5912,isfp,"Certain songs definitely take me back to major emotional events in my life. Whenever I‚Äôm deeply processing a feeling (typically love) I am hyper-aware of music I guess, and relate to it, often associating the current person or event in my life with a certain song and getting sentimental about that song forever after that. 
If the feelings for that person ever change, so do my feelings for that song. I cringe and turn the station when I hear a couple of songs that come on the local radio station and it‚Äôs one hundred percent because they dredge up uncomfortable memories.
On the other hand, I can get into a fight with my husband and then hear a Lumineers song on my playlist that reminds me of him boosting me up on his shoulders and running across a parking lot so I didn‚Äôt step in mud puddles while wearing sandals. And suddenly everything is wonderful and back in that moment.
That‚Äôs Se."
5913,isfp,"Yup, I feel the same way about music as you do. I associate different songs with different times  and the different places that I‚Äôve been. When I hear certain songs, all the memories and emotions just overwhelm me in that moment. I love it "
5914,isfp,"This is gonna be weird, guys, but ok.
I grew up watching AMVs (anime music videos) and MVs (music vids) of tv shows and anime I liked.
Since I have no talent, I never actually created many myself (there‚Äôs a few lurking on youtube somewhere from like 2008 lmao), but whenever I listen to songs I love I imagine what certain scenes and clips would fit with the beat/lyrics.
I basically create MVs of movies/shows/etc. in my head. 
So... I‚Äôm a loser, moving on."
5915,isfp,"Music for me is comforting. It doesn't try to control us, but is their freely for people to enjoy and connect with and that's what I like.
I like the way music makes me feel and how it triggers my emotions and memories within. It's like it's speaking to me and understands where I'm coming from without having to say anything and that's how I recognize what taste I have or prefer in music. It's also like an extension of my personality or behavior. That's probably why when others don't agree or have the same taste in music that I do, I understand that there's a side to them that I've never discovered or felt to know.
I really enjoy music and the infinite amounts that I've yet to possibly experience. =)"
5916,isfp,"I know EXACTLY what you're talking about.
Anytime I hear the song ""Animal I Have Become"" I remember every detail of a moment when I was younger playing a video game at a friends house. I can remember clearly the custom made wrestler I made on his WWE game and that was the theme song I chose.
Anytime I hear the song ""Popcorn Funk"" I can remember clearly the first time I ever got high. Despite the fuzziness of most other memories on the subject.
Every time I hear the song ""The Warriors Song"" I remember clearly the desensitivity training I went through when I joined the infantry. Same goes for ""Indestructible"" Those videos were fucking horrifying. I hate both of those songs.
For some reason when I hear ""Let It Go"" I always imagine being on an American Idol stage in front of Simon Cowell just belting that song knowing damn well he's gonna tell me I'm terrible. No right no wrong no rules for me. Im free."
5917,isfp,I feel music throughout my body. I went to see Ron Gallo in Kansas City a couple weeks ago and drank a bit. If I wasn't headbanging and swaying I had my hands up to the sky with my head down like Christians at mega churches. 
5918,isfp,That sounds very Si to me. I love music and I search for music that fits my mood. I like upbeat music during the day and sad slow music at night. When I'm going through a tough period I look for lyrics that match my situation. But it is about my mood not my surroundings as you describe.
5919,isfp,"Like the planning that's involved... The attention...
I've never wanted a huge wedding for myself because I hate attention, I hate planning, and can't be bothered with all the romantic stuff..... if ever get married I want to elope. Lol I was wondering if other ISFPs thought about weddings.
What are your thoughts?
And if you're married, what was your ISFP wedding like?"
5920,isfp,"I see it as the opertunity to show your decision to commit to the people you feel are important. And then due to my religious veiws. Planning is not fun. Ill help make decisions but not plan. I also dont care how fancy it is, its not about how fancy it is. It is about the other person. 
I think this will depend on our view on marriage and weddings. "
5921,isfp,When I was planning my wedding I could not care less about anything except for my dress and the food. I recall hiding most of the night because I was exhausted and didn't want to talk to anyone. I'm divorced now lol but I have no desire to remarry as I don't really see the point in marrying someone. I think I can love someone forever without doing that and throwing away thousands of dollars.
5922,isfp,"I feel terrible at over prices weddings. Specially bride dresses. I'd rather have a nice small party and invite close friends, and then use the money for furniture or helping people who need it. In fact, I don't know if I'll ever get married, let alone have a party. Either way, seems wasteful to me. People focus too much on the wedding party and forget about working on the actual marriage."
5923,isfp,"After reading the comments, I feel like I'm different from the other ISFPs that commented....
I personally love weddings. I love seeing love, and I love surprising and doing things that make my SO happy. He always says that I never fail to surprise him. The actually wedding part is not too important to me, but I want it to be spontaneous and fun; a reason to celebrate, a reason to get people together. I don't like being the center attention, and I am terrible at planning :| That would make me feel so stressful. I'm MORE excited about the honeymoon part. I think it would make my SO very happy. I would only have 4 members of my family, and he'd have probably ~50 people from his family. "
5924,isfp,"I'm not married anymore but the wedding we had was simple, cheap, and a lot of fun. I tend to not like formalities, and neither did my ex, so the ceremony was super short. It was so short that one of the guests missed it entirely because she had to use the washroom XD 
It was essentially just one big party. That's how weddings should be imo."
5925,isfp,"I hate weddings. I'd elope 100%. I can't be the centre of attention. I freeze up. I don't like going to weddings, I don't like planning them, the pictures bore me. I was in one wedding party....I'll never do it again. Zero desire. "
5926,isfp,"Weddings are meh. I'd prefer a smaller wedding, nothing too extravagant. I don't want people who couldn't give two shits about me attending it (like relatives of friends of friends). I'd treat it same way I'd treat a high school prom: having high and low exceptions at the same time, knowing it's a rite of passage thing but not making a huge deal out of it. The planning sounds terribly stressful. I'm a shy person though I like having my attention whore moments. As long as it's nothing too big. "
5927,isfp,"I'm only in high school so my opinion is probably gonna change, but right now I think of it as a hassle. Most of them are so pricey and take a lot of planning and UGH the attention. If I do end up getting married, I would love it to be a casual, private wedding in a place that is meaningful and romantic. Bonus points if we say the words of a Westerosi wedding instead of a casual one."
5928,isfp,"I have mixed feelings honestly. On one hand it's so much work and money for one day. But on the other hand, I do want that experience.
But as a whole, I lean towards wanting to save the money for a down payment on a house, or a nice honeymoon. I want a marriage more than a wedding.  I'm too much of an introvert to have people fawning over me all day. I'd want to just go home and relax by the time the reception starts.
If I have a wedding I'll probably keep it small and cheap."
5929,isfp,"I have no prospect of marriage anytime soon but I do bartend for a catering company which does a lot of weddings. It's literally the same thing over and over, ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, speeches, dancing. It seems so pointless and I for one would not like being the center of attention at it. This doesn't mean I don't value marriage, quite the contrary actually. It's just that weddings seem so unnecessary to me. "
5930,isfp,"We had a small wedding, 30 people in my aunt an uncles backyard, I didn't wear shoes, to feel the earth ;) 
The planning was stressful, hello introverts, but it went fine. There was no striving for perfection, what ever will be, will be.  It was a great day.  Only regret, I forgot to organize the music beforehand so it got messed up, but it was such a mild thing. "
5931,isfp,"Really depends on why I feel guilty. Was it something I needed to do in order to protect my mental health? Or did I behave like a douche? Both can make me feel guilty equally.
So yeah, in the second case I have the opportunity to learn from it. I can reflect on my behaviour and try to forgive myself because I probably had reasons why I acted the way I did. I know that I can learn from mistakes and that is truly a gift, imo. So in the end I can turn it around and be glad to have something I can use to change."
5932,isfp,"no matter the situation i just try to acknowledge how i'm feeling/what happened and accept it. i remind myself that there's nothing i can do about the past, but that i can do something about my present and future - change. really, i try not to overthink it. it doesn't do me any good. it takes practice though, it isn't easy. "
5933,isfp,"Guilt is useless. It activates the reward center of our brain so it makes us feel like we're doing something to fix the situation, but we're just making it worse. I try to focus my energy on actually fixing it, or if there's nothing more I can do, learning from this experience to avoid making the same mistake again."
5934,isfp,"I've just taken the test to find out that I'm a spot-on ISFP (or possibly ISTP, without the extreme sport fetish), so bear with me if this is a newbie question to the group....
I'm 50.  I've been in the IT field for a while, and like doing what I'm doing, as long as I'm helping people.  If find that when things like annual reviews come up and the ""Where do you see yourself in 5/10/15 years"", or ""What are your career goals"" questions come up, I just can't really think of anything...
I mean, my career goals are to make enough money to keep my family out of debt and live in reasonable comfort, maybe have some free time to do my hobbies and spend with my family.  
Sometimes I feel like maybe I look like a loser to my kids, because I haven't achieved a higher status in life.  Sometimes I feel I'm inadequate in my wife's eyes, because I don't strive to be a big shot in my career.
Would this concern be worthy of discussion in the ISFP world?  Do any of you identify with this?"
5935,isfp,"Everything about this post is spot on. I didn't even realize people were making goals and looking towards the future in high school until after I had already graduated. For me it's just nice to go with the flow and now I feel behind because everyone else seems to be constantly setting goals. Hate it when people ask about your future goals and then when you don't have any they act like you're an idiot. For me it's just too stressful to constantly be worrying about a future that I have little control over and desires that change too rapidly to really sit down and come up with a plan to attain them. 
As for worrying about your family, I think you should just be honest with them if they ever bring it up. Be honest, loving, and supportive of them and hopefully they'll treat you the same way. You're more than your career. They'll just be happy to have an awesome husband and father. If it is an issue for one of them then listen and find out what you can do to change/ fix the situation. "
5936,isfp,"Dude, I forgot this was an ISFP thing. I just started University a few weeks back. One of my classes had me fill out a sheet where I wrote out my life goals, then my goals for the next 4, 2, and 1 years, and then a few months. Then I had to write what steps I could take to get there.
For all of them, I just wrote out ""Get through school with little or no debt."" and ""Make friends."" I had to explain to the professor when I turned it in that I wasn't being lazy or anything; I just couldn't think of any real life goals for the future.
Now that I see all you guys are the same way, I feel a little better about it."
5937,isfp,"I can also identify with this. I've been working in IT for about 14 years. I've come to the realization that I'm content where I am. I have no desire to be in a leadership position. Over the years, I've found that I like my job more if the systems I support can make a difference in people's lives. Right now, I work for a large health system. I don't handle stress very well. Our career goals are definitely aligned. I want to make enough to stay out of debt, take a once or twice a year vacation and feed my videogame habit. I'm definitely a homebody for the most part."
5938,isfp,"I'm sure you have an artistic talent/style of some type you haven't tapped yet.  You'll find your niche.
Luckily, I'm a professional musician (weekends and weddings) and an artist (woodwork/crafts) as well.  So I have that outlet.  It would be nice if they paid the bills full time.  
Though I've been in the IT field for over 15 years, much of it is either not challenging, or is TOO challenging for my current mindset, but it does pay the bills for the most part..."
5939,isfp,"Dude, tell me about it. It was hard enough finding a College to go to last minute, while everyone else was talking about what major they were going into and deciding between three different schools that they had been scouting for months.
I'm just lucky that I have a friend who is in the same major as me and is a long-term thinker. He's basically making grad-school plans for the both of us at this point."
5940,isfp,"I haven't seen ISFPs labeled as a type that likes to debate very often, but I haven't seen the opposite either. I was wondering what other ISFPs thought of debating.
Personally I enjoy debating, though I can only debate for a while before having to take a break. It takes a lot of mental energy for me to sort useful emotions from emotions that hinder my argument, and then implement that correctly. I typically go in spurts of debates (mostly online) where for a few days I go into a debating frenzy, but then have to avoid it altogether and recuperate."
5941,isfp,"I only debate when I'm interested in the topic and want to learn more. If I'm set on my opinion on an issue I won't interject and I'll most likely remove myself from the conversation. Essentially I don't care to try and sway someone else to my side, but if I'm unsure or uneducated I will let someone tell me how they feel and generally I'll come up with my own opinion based on their info."
5942,isfp,"There may be a chance of ISFPs that like debates, but I would assume that the majority don‚Äôt really enjoy them as it involves conflict and ISFPs aren‚Äôt fans of conflict. Personally, I‚Äôm not much for debate. Usually if I try to debate, it‚Äôs more of an exchange of ideals and information that leaves both sides the more knowledgeable."
5943,isfp,"Depends on the tone of the conversation. When I'm listening, I'll decide on my amount of input if the conversation is leading down a balanced path or not. Depends solely on the flow, although if I feel strongly enough about a topic I will add my opinion as often as I can fit it in. Most of the time I enjoy listening to debates, only joining in to bring all the points together or at the end of the argument after I've heard all the different perspectives. "
5944,isfp,"I enter debates which involve topics and agendas that I'm particularly passionate about, and don't enjoy then always. But then, I fiercely back whatever point I'm trying to get across,  with abolute relentlessness. I find debates for the sake of debating pretty repugnant though. "
5945,isfp,I like online debating. I don't think I would be very good at a formal debate  (though I've never tried) because I'm constantly tripping over my words and easily riled. I listen to formal debates all the time though.
5946,isfp,"Debates usually go poorly for me, mainly because I only really get into them when I've been in an increasingly bad mood for awhile and my ability to refrain from telling people all the reasons why they're idiots has been whittled away.
Plus even when I'm not in a bad mood, debate drains my emotional energy really fast nowadays. It used to not be so bad, but the past several years of anxiety/depression/constant irritability have really taken a toll on my ability to amicably express disagreement.
Note that I'm more likely an INTP than ISFP considering testing history and whatnot, though."
5947,isfp,"This is the exact reason I‚Äôve been so burnt out in formal debate competitions. It was all about ‚Äústyle‚Äù rather than the contents of our speeches, direct admissions that the judges will be biased or inexperienced, motions where I don‚Äôt get to pick a side of or reach any kind of nuanced middle ground. I still enjoy debate, but not for the sport."
5948,isfp,"Just wondering your guys's opinions on relationships and how being an isfp has affected your different relationships. Any insight or advice to give to others? And any other questions you guys might have answers to
PS: I made this post in response to /u/mrnobody95 other post how /r/isfp doesn't have many posts and others mentioned they don't always make posts just comment on others. Hopefully we'll get some discussion going!"
5949,isfp,"People like me generally I think. They say I'm charming, funny, and cool to be around. I was once told this by a friend: ""It's cool how you don't have a social clique you're a part of, you just simply are,"" and that made my day :) People like my non judgmental attitude and I'm told I'm really nice. I like everyone in different ways, and the people I shouldn't be friends with I know as soon as I meet them with extreme accuracy. Just being me has gotten great success in relationships due to my flexibility in social situations. I can be excited and fun outside (Se) but I can talk about a serious topic and listen well when needed (Fi and Ni). Some people dislike how I don't text them back immediately or how I'll just shut off and stop talking. It's like a switch. One moment, I'm in my head introspecting and being completely cut off, then someone talks to me, then suddenly Se kicks in and I am personable and fun to be around."
5950,isfp,"Shoutout! 
I have yet to see myself into any serious relationship.... or any relationship with companionship at all actually. I don't really know why. Maybe just the introverted side or maybe the side of me that was hung up on the same girl but was too shy to do anything about it. Dunno. Being an ISFP is hard. "
5951,isfp,"I sometimes have a problem keeping in contact with people, but social media helps with that. I feel like I connect mostly with people that are more extroverted than me. In conversation I'm more of a go with the flow person, and usually don't control the conversation, so I usually like hanging out in small groups."
5952,isfp,"I think for me an ISFP aspect would be how I'm not that official about these things. I actually find it a bit strange if someone asks me ""on a date"" in a formal way, or talks objectively about the ""state of our friendship/relationship."" Usually my relationship with someone would kindof grow ""organically"" just based on if we get along, I'd want to hang out with them again and then eventually we're a part of each others' life. I think this could be annoying for some people though, haha. "
5953,isfp,"ENTP that dated an ISFP here.
Great relationship overall, lasted many years. 
She was intensely loving and caring, she really nurtured me and loved me more than I could imagine anyone else loving me. I enjoyed her outlook of the world, and her sense of knowing who she was. 
Ultimately though, the NT/SF dynamic did not pan out as I did not find myself intellectually challenged by her, and when I would bring up abstract conversation topics she would not respond well to them, if at all. And when we did have a conversation about something abstract, she would feel as if she was being personally attacked, but this is something ENTPs encounter often. "
5954,isfp,"Like. Other types are more able to be uncomfortable emotionally and therefore can get into situations that could be difficult but good for them allowing them to grow as people. But as an isfp first and foremost prioritizing my own feelings it seems like that causes me to want to be comfortable most of the time so i dont like getting out of my comfort zone. and also because my feelings are taking up so much space in my attention other functions are stunted.  I wish i was an enfp or something :( im always using Fi HARD, man. Seems like it drowns out anything else. Plus Fi is so basic. Every one has feelings. Theyre the most basic fucking thing. Babies have feelings and nothing else pretty much. Have i really not learned to go off of anything past my own personal feelings since infant hood? I feel like Fi dominance especially as an isfp is the dumbest function ever :( "
5955,isfp,"I know that feeling, I have a feeling Fi isn't valued by society overall. But also, I think others could benefit from having more Fi and I think us Fi-dominants have something that others don't. Think of Fi as giving you a solid identity. Because of that stable identity and self-knowledge, we deal with considerably less amount of problems that other people have to deal with. We have a head start in knowing what is good for ourselves, what we want to deal with and how to avoid things that we don't want to. Actually, it's not that us Fi-dominants have more struggles (more struggles adapting to society maybe), but different struggles. Yes, we might have problems moving out of our comfort zone, but we also don't deal with constant lack of boundaries or social insecurities and whatnot other feeler types might have. I think it's actually pretty lucky to be an ISFP, you just have to look at the other side of things a bit."
5956,isfp,"Your auxiliary function will help you if you think you are too stuck in your Fi. You are selling Fi short because it has important values to the world. You just need to figure that out for yourself.  It's not just feelings, it's more than that. "
5957,isfp,"INFP here.  
everything is a handicap. my friend is a marine.  he has learned to ""control"" his feelings and empathy, he says.  then when his wife gets mad that he takes her to a place she said she didn't want to go to eat, he says ""I don't know what her problem is.""  He then gets mad at her for not talking at dinner because she is in this place she plainly told him she did not want to have dinner at.  Having not enough emotions and empathy is just as bad as having too much emotions and empathy.  
I am very strong at abstract stuff, so I can learn very difficult concepts with ease.  The other end of that is I suck at details so I can read something 10 times and not remember the names, dates, details.  Every strength is a weakness...and vice versa...  
So learn the strengths of Fi dominance (strong value system, passion, motivation, helping people, empathy, understanding people deeply, love of art, self-knowledge, authenticity, honesty, integrity, self-reliance, independence) and work on reigning in the things it sucks at (being hypercritical when someone annoys you, hypersensitive, mood swingy, depressed, ruminating, apathetic to things that don't inspire you, etc)"
5958,isfp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/infp] Infps what do you think about this post i made about being fi dominant (especially as an isfp)?

¬†^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
5959,isfp,"I‚Äôm def Fi dom and Ne in how i gather input from the outside world. Over the years i‚Äôve gathered enough data and experience where now I trust my Fi hard.  I‚Äôve said in other posts i consider it like my ‚Äúspider sense‚Äù. It is a bit rudimentary as it is this general good/bad feeling about ppl/places/decisions etc.  this happens extremely fast as it is wired to a more primordial part of my psyche‚Äîa reflex, instinct.  While i‚Äôve learned to heed that what i‚Äôm trying to develop more is to not to let it trigger an emotion such as fear/excitement/sadness and analyze it more with my Ti to understand the why. Fi is not just feelings or emotions. Maybe your Se is how you percieve the world all the time so too much stimuli will be too intense and thus you feel a need to control it and so follow predictable and go to places you already know? Even if Fi dom you have everything else, its just about preferences"
5960,isfp,"So I'm an ISTP, and my friend is ISFP. Occasionally we will complain to eachother about upsetting things, and usually we can relate pretty well. But the thing is... dominant Fi and Ti (ISFP and ISTP dominant functions respectively) paired with Se means that when we relate, we relate to similar experiences we ourselves have had or are having. The issue is... I'm not sure how to validate her feelings without turning the conversation towards myself. Like if she says school has been really stressful lately, obviously the way I relate would be to say I know what that's like because I have a lot of tough classes. But that just seems to have too many ""I""s in it... I'm just not sure how to reply to a complaint, how do I show that I care without also being this guy?: ""oh yeah I know what that's like, everyone goes through that, it's not that bad, blah blah blah.""    Just saying ""that's rough"" seems like I don't care, and also goes without saying."
5961,isfp,"I don‚Äôt feel equipt to answer this but I don‚Äôt want to leave you hanging.
Sometimes I like to ask questions to encourage people to talk. Sometimes I share my own experience and ask a question to tie it back to the other person and allow them to have the last word so it doesn‚Äôt seem like i‚Äôm One upping them or always bringing the conversation back to me. 
For example, she might say ‚Äúschool is stressful because the classes are hard‚Äù I might say ‚ÄúI understand. My classes are also stressful but I am lucky to have a reasonable prof. Do your profs help make the course load easier?‚Äù 
This example is a very rigid and shallow exchange and irl it usually flows a lot better. I can‚Äôt imagine a conversation between the two of you and this is the best I could come up with without any background info. In real life, I‚Äôm only half as awkward as I seem online and this approach usually works for me. 
I hope this helps! Best of luck to you! 
Edit: an after thought-
Because she is Fi dominant, she may have already appraised the education system and you could try to get on the same level as her values. For example, you could say ‚Äúschool is stressful. I hate how they force you to compete against each other by marking on a curve. I find this encourages me to sacrifice authentic learning and take a more ‚Äòlearn to test‚Äô approach. Would t it be great if we were marked against ourselves and not otherS?‚Äù 
You might want to have a pretty good idea of what her values are on a particular subject before going this way. You could ask her what she thinks though to find out. As an ISFP, I‚Äôm always thinking about things and what they result in and how they could be improved pr the negative effects could be mitigated. I also love talking about that shit. Maybe she does too."
5962,isfp,"Sometimes all someone needs is for someone to listen and understand. It can feel a bit obvious or repetitive to you, but questions and simple reactions to what she's saying can go a long way. Even saying something like, ""I'm sorry, that sounds hard."" can mean a lot more to her than you think it does. Especially if you follow it up with questions about her situation. Even if it feels like the question has no practical/constructive purpose, just listening and letting her talk could be highly therapeutic for her. Saying you relate to her isn't a bad thing, as long as it isn't minimizing her experience or implying you know exactly what she's going through. Just let her do most of the talking. :) If you can think of a person or a time when someone helped you feel better, taking inspiration from that could be helpful.
This definitely goes for anyone, not just Feelers. And I'm not qualified either, lol, this is just my experience. Good luck! :D"
5963,isfp,"I agree with both comments so far. Reaction, asking questions and also specific answers to what she‚Äôs saying go a long way. I find it difficult to open up to people who don‚Äôt actually react to what I‚Äôve said, and just answer with their own story. I like it when the other person asks me questions and is engaged in what I‚Äôm saying. They don‚Äôt necessarily have to agree with me, but if they ask me questions it shows me they genuinely care what‚Äôs bothering me or just what I have to say in general. By asking her questions she will feel like she‚Äôs being listened to, as well as giving her a safe place to vent without feeling like she‚Äôs being judged, and the conversation with flow. You will find she will like to ask you questions too."
5964,isfp,"I do this and get kind of annoyed when for whatever reason subtitles aren't available
I do it because I like to be able to focus on other things than the sounds without fearing like I missed something important.  Volume varies, as does my attention (and other people can be intermittent distractions as well).  Subtitles ensure I can keep up while being able to focus on other details"
5965,isfp,i grew up watching subtitles since my parents are deaf so when they're not on it's just strange for me. i also watch foreign movies/shows so that probably also has something to do with it. but mostly i just like to have them on in case i don't properly hear what's being said so i don't miss anything.
5966,isfp,"Subtitles are fine if you are watching something in another language or the audio is too quiet, but they are super distracting to me because almost all subtitles are slightly different than what you hear.  For example, someone in a show might say, ""that's so crazy"" and the subtitles just say ""that's crazy.""  Then I start putting more attention into seeing if the subs match the audio or not, and I miss out on what's happening in the show."
5967,isfp,"I do it because I can't stand missing any of the words, and without the subtitles you have to concentrate harder, and even then you can still miss something either because the person on the tv was too quiet or someone walks in and starts being loud af."
5968,isfp,"No hate directed towards anyone that does, I'm just wondering if anyone else doesn't. I can't get behind it no matter how hard I try and it seems to be something commonly associated with our type lol. "
5969,isfp,"I'm more partial to anime movies. Akira, Paprika, My Neighbor the Yamadas, Spirited Away, etc. Probably because I don't have the time or energy to invest in the billion anime shoes out there. I'll watch my 2 hour movie and be done with it, thanks very much."
5970,isfp,"There are a lot of animes I like, but the anime industry as it is currently right now is a bit... meh. Not a huge fan of many animes being made. (Way too much fanservice, generic characters and tropes being used a lot...)
But, as other commenters have said, I can greatly appreciate a unique, colorful and creative art style + bgm (edit: and a good story)."
5971,isfp,"The only ones I could ever get into are the mainstreams ones (sailor moon, inuyasha, full metal alchemist) and the Hayao Miyazaki movies..but I just can‚Äôt get into any other ones. I like their aesthetic, but that‚Äôs it."
5972,isfp,"well don't try to like something. Look, it's supposed that Fi doms are kinda Hippies, but I fucking hate hippies and all that shitty ""smoking pot"" fuckshit.  so don't feel bad if you don't fit in the anime club. So, if fucking anime is what makes you happy, fuck anime. I like anime a little. I don't like almost any anime serie, but the manga drawing style has a good level of realism/description being very simple and fast to draw. And I like to draw because it's just a way to express myself or imagined situations. Nice to meet you.
‚Äã
‚Äã
fuck hippies."
5973,isfp,"I feel like every xSFP I know loves it! Maybe you'd get along better with my crowd lol 
Honestly I'm not a huge fan of the animation style :/ Even though I know sometimes they tell great stories and can be really funny, the art/animation style is hard for me to get past. 
Why do you love it? "
5974,isfp,"Yup. I stopped watching anime long ago. Currently I just care about Gintama and the Blue Exorcist manga.
I was curious about Radiant because the manga was really nice (and made by a french) but in the anime it was converted to a generic ass shonen :/"
5975,isfp,"I've come to accept that I'm just not a ""winner"" when it comes to sports. But I don't care; I enjoy being around my friends and if I can prove to be of some use by putting my body someplace strategic, then I'm glad to be of service to the team. Nevertheless, we often lose. "
5976,isfp,"I'm very much an ISFP. My ESTJ half has spent the past year of living together telling me how slow, useless and pointless I am. I've spent years overcoming emotional and communicative problems, I'm very aware of my 'weirdness' and weaknesses. He can't see the personal leaps I've made because he doesn't understand feelings or hardship. Everything - good decisions, confidence, popularity - come natural to him. Whereas I'm still batting anxiety at the age of 33 and have not created dreams because I was chasing love for a long time. 
Any advice? Is the relationship doomed? Am I doomed? I just want to talk to people who may understand the thought processes I have that he's never gone through. 
I am ambitious, it just takes me awhile to see a clear path to an idea before contemplating even following it through.
Hugs
xx"
5977,isfp,"Hi. I don't know what isfp etc means but you should not be in a relationship with a partner that calls you slow, useless and pointless. That's emotional abuse and you don't need to put up with it. All the best. "
5978,isfp,"I know from personal experience that XSTJs are really hard to deal with when you're an ISFP. It sounds like you're feeling oppressed and you're not being appreciated for your strengths. That can be very damaging for us. Trust me, I've spent years trying to get over criticisms STJs have made of me too. If you feel this way, get out or you may end up disliking yourself because you don't feel appreciated.
Feelers need to take care of themselves. We are sensitive creatures. "
5979,isfp,"Thanks for this orb360. I feel that even if I managed to do this for him, he would still be unhappy with me. And he refuses to stop calling me fat. I won't change my behaviour for someone who won't change for me. "
5980,isfp,"While this answer is true, i don't think it's right... why does he/she have to show progress to the ESTJ? is not his boss or something, i think this will bring more anxiety, you have to make progress for yourself, not for others (at least it is your boss)"
5981,isfp,"Did you ever practice meditation? It sounds weird but is helping me a lot, i don't live with my ESTJ dad now a days but sometimes i see him and i know i will be judged and my whole life will be judged.
So i just go te meditate before seeing him, there is a place within yourself when you can be calm, secure and safe and you won't even care what he thinks or says about you, and tbh i feel he just respects me way more when i'm calm and confident, just an idea!"
5982,isfp,"Hi again, listen you are trying to save this relationship. Why? He calls you fat and doesn't fulfill your emotional needs, seriously, why do you want to be in this relationship? 
I don't think there is a man I know how would do this to his partner, you're a grown woman and regardless of your sensitivity and introversion, it is no excuse for him to belittle and degrade you.
 You are worth more than this! "
5983,isfp,"Honestly? I feel that if we break up, I will lose our circle of friends. And then I will go back to being on my own and depressed. At age 33, I've only now got the friend thing down (friends have never been an easy thing for me to make) and I just can't face solitude all over again. His extroversion and strength has been beneficial. But after 2 years, the dust has settled and I've made a hideous mistake :("
5984,isfp,"I'm 32, I understand where you're coming from, I think I do. 
What I would say is, your personal happiness relationship wise is more important than your social circle. This is your life, why waste it being unhappy because you fear the other?
I don't mean to be rude but it's clear from your replies here you are a sensitive soul and I know the world can seem a horrible daunting place but it is entirely within your gift to get out there and take what you want. You do not have to settle for a fake smile around the BBQ with friends and quiet tears in the bathroom at home.
In any case, real friends would want to support you and would hopefully be tactful in the event of a break up. All the best!"
5985,isfp,"So I have spent a ridiculous amount of time going back and forth between if I am an INTJ or an ISFP. Please help me decide where I fit in.
‚Äã
List of my traits:
Pretty sure I am Fi, Te, Se, Ni, but I‚Äôm not sure the order..and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm INTJ or ISFP

I find it easy to make decisions and stick to them
Tend to have unwavering opinions, I will debate something until I agree 100% with the logic of the other side
Tend to take the position of leader in a group of people
Always daydreaming and zoned out
Tend to be insensitive because I‚Äôm super objective
Sarcastic comments all the time
When I‚Äôm stressed I get hyper focused on my work and start organizing everything
When I‚Äôm super stressed I start spiraling and freaking out over how I am failing
If I am sad and don‚Äôt want to be I can reason to myself why I shouldn‚Äôt be and kinda turn it off, the majority of the time
Really love art, reading, aesthetics, things like that
Get introspective all the time
Very strong personal values
In an argument, I‚Äôm good at responding right away without having to think things through
read a lot of philosophy and love hypothetical questions, logic puzzles and things of the sort. Pretty much constantly filling my free time with activities like that. 

There‚Äôs a lot more but those are some of the main parts .. do you have any questions I could think about that might make the solution more telling?"
5986,isfp,"The biggest reason that I felt that is because I‚Äôm very good at navigating emotions and reasoning through them. Also two huge and really fundamental parts of my personality are my strong personal values that I use as the basis for a lot of my internal logic and also how into art, music, culture, traveling etc I am.. that seems very non-INTJ and more ISFP (maybe?) "
5987,isfp,"Found this amazing quote in a random ISFP profile and it hit so close to home.  I've always viewed the world in this outsider/alien type of way, but was never able to articulate it.  It's incredibly accurate for me.  Behold:
""When it comes down to it, ISFP‚Äôs are naturally designed observers.  ISFP‚Äôs live their life always engaged in observation, like their entire existence is a movie and they are the audience behind their eye sockets.  Other types might find this to be a horrible existence, never being directly involved in life, but to the ISFP, the best experiences are the ones most people don‚Äôt even notice until they take a step back from all  the action."" 
I'll admit it's a lonely feeling.  It's almost as if I'm never really experiencing reality in the present moment, but rather watching it all unfold from an outside, third person perspective. However, I believe the upside to this unique ""watcher"" perspective is that it allows us to notice all the subtleties and nuances that many others may completely miss. These subtleties and nuances are sometimes more special than the experience itself.
Can you dudes relate?"
5988,isfp,"Can relate, I always think of myself as some sort of character from a first person game, I don't really think too much about myself and instead I'm almost exclusively focused on what happens on the outside."
5989,isfp,Reminds me of when I was younger and I'd play a game with myself where I'd pretend I'm in a game of the sims and in my head I'd picture a top-down view of my house or wherever I was and imagine giving myself commands and watch as I do seemingly mundane things. I swear I wasn't as lonely as that makes it sound lol
5990,isfp,"Hey lovelies, what do you think about Esfps?  I personally thought I was one, and tested as one every time.  But function stack-wise I‚Äôm definitely an Isfp.  And reading descriptions of how Esfps process things, being entirely in the moment, I couldn‚Äôt relate at all.  But behavior wise, I relate way more to Esfps.  In fact the Isfp descriptions kind of make me cringe.  But weirdly when I look at celebrity Isfps or self typed Isfps in real life, it‚Äôs like looking in a mirror personality wise.  Idk can anyone relate?  I feel like Esfps and Isfps are the most different from each other in terms of introverted/extroverted types, but I can see aspects of both within me."
5991,isfp,"One of my best friends is esfp. I think I would have identified with esfp more when I was younger (but not with those awful descriptions  that seem like something unhealthy exxps in general would do (partying, being shallow, being aggressive)). What I've noticed is the extroversion/ introversion differences. My friend LOVES being around people, developing good feelings in groups, going out and having adventures. I used to be like that but now that I am more introverted, I hate being around strangers, I get tired easily when I go outside, I have a more wary and negative view towards people, and I love my house. My esfp friend actually told me how sad she would be when she was alone at home. And this:
They say that about all sensors, especially esfp and estp. But of course, esfp and estp can plan ahead. They just aren't constantly planning ahead like NJ types. There are too sides to it: planning ahead constantly that you never get anything done, and never planning ahead and being inefficient. Of course, all types need to find the middle ground."
5992,isfp,"I always have like a mild attraction toward esfps, but I'm usually disappointed by what appears to be their lack of foresight or consideration.   Not sure if that's just the few I've known though?  And not sure if the attraction is genuine or more that I wish I was bolder and better with people like they are, ha--  but would want to keep my other characteristics at the same time.."
5993,isfp,"Yeah idk.  I‚Äôve pretty much come to terms with being an isfp.  I think a small part of me always knew it, but I just have such an admiration for esfps, kinda wish I was one.  I can relate somewhat to your friend, I love being with friends, love going places, but I do love my alone time.  I think introversion/extroversion isn‚Äôt as black and white as mbti makes it out to be."
5994,isfp,"Yeah that's true. I'm 70% introverted so it's more extreme for me. You sound like me when I was in middle school. Conversely, I thought I was esfp back then when my infp best friend thought I was isfp. You also have to remember that the extroversion/introversion part doesn't make too big of a difference. The conscious cognitive functions are only switched in position slightly, and they are the same functions anyway. Most esfps I know irl aren't as shallow as those website descriptions anyway."
5995,isfp,"Growing up, prior to knowing about the MBTI, I thought ISFPs were oversensitive people trying to act deep and who made dumb career choices. It turns out that's not the case. People often DON'T understand ISFPs, and it's because we live in a society where people are ignorant of psychology. Many people who major in psychology are even ignorant on critical aspects of psychology. This is because wrong things are taught and things limited in practicality are taught."
5996,isfp,"No. We oversimplify psychology in society, people are very unaware of many biases, and we still use outdated psychology.
People still think focus testing and the Rorschach test work.
People fail to use subliminal messaging correctly and overvalue it.
People still use very outdated Freudian concepts when raising their kids and are way too reliant on those in their conclusions about their children's behavior.
Most people fail to use classical conditioning correctly.
Teachers fail to do even a decent job at teaching and keeping their students attention and almost always think the problem is the behavior of the students rather than their own behavior.
People fail to use positive/negative punishment and reinforcement correctly.
People fail TREMENDOUSLY at communication.
A major example that many people go their entire lives unaware of is that we're pitching to the croc brain, not the neocortex.
A massive amount of the population is ignorant on and of the MBTI.
People go their entire lives unaware of almost every meditation, meaning they miss out on MASSIVE benefits.
Fitness is actually 50% psychology, 30% kinesiology, and 20% biology, and people use very little of the psychological aspect.
Society in general is actually SO horrible at communication that much of society's problems stem from this."
5997,isfp,Overall pretty good kid I think. I was polite and generally respectful to adults. I loved making people laugh and was really silly. I hated school though and I was kinda slow. Never did my homework...just wanted to play most of the time and eat junk food lol
5998,isfp,"I was pretty shy and really sensitive. I always seemed to get along better with adults than I did with people my own age. I was almost always polite (because it's impossible to be polite 100% of the time) and enjoyed being around girls more than guys because the girls weren't hyper-competitive. I got sick pretty frequently (two or three times a month), so I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I wanted to do well in it, but I kept forgetting to do my homework. Sometimes I'd actually do my homework but forget it at home. 
I was also rather detached from some things. I played soccer one summer and I spent most of the time watching butterflies or running away from the soccer ball. My coach told me to not be afraid of the ball, to which I replied ""I'm not afraid of the ball; I'm afraid of the people running after the ball."" I also poured gasoline around the foundation of my house because, and I quote, ""I thought the house was thirsty."" Younger me was kinda' stupid that way."
5999,isfp,"Super outgoing as a kid.  Loved performing for an audience. Was criticized by teachers for being disruptive and too talkative.  
Got fed up and in protest didn't talk to anyone during my middle school years.  Became awkward and quiet during that time. Teachers started complaining that I was too quiet.  
Last two years of high school finally got out of my shell but still on the more quiet side.  College was pretty outgoing but others were not receptive, I guess I was annoying?  Now I'm pretty reserved, but I definitely can hold my own in social situations.  "
6000,isfp,"Yep yep yep. ALL of this. My parents always said they were lucky to have such a good child because I was so respectful. For me, though, it wasn't because I respect authority, it's because having angry parents just made things harder and I liked making things go as smoothly as possible."
6001,isfp,"I cry it out. I can't seem to display my sadness in front of friends for some reason. So i end up suppressing it and still act like nothing is wrong. I would head home to cry, let all the bottled up emotions out, then have a good night sleep. It normally works for me, and i feel better for the next few days. Hope it works for you. "
6002,isfp,"most of the time im like the people that replied here because the person i can talk to on stuff like that is not in my life anymore.  Now,  i also convert it into drawing or something. hope that helps!"
6003,isfp,"I'm late replying here, but this was an interesting question. One way I cope is by reassuring myself, very strongly, that this feeling will pass. I know it's overwhelmed me before, and I know I got through it, and out the other side. With that in mind, I just try to get to the end of the day and be kind to myself.
To be honest, it's one of the most important strategies I have, because otherwise it's hard to see any end to the sadness when you're in the middle of it. 
What are you sad about?"
6004,isfp,"Yeah . Im late to the rodeo also . I find that we as a group tend to brode and get to reflective . Please try to avoid alchohol . I actually have tried various "" stay in the moment "" methods . Focused breathing , yoga things like that . They help at times . "
6005,isfp,"I write down what I'm feeling, and I try to include the reason(s) why I feel like that. 
Don't think too much about what you're writing, just do it, because you're not writing it down for anyone to read it (except yourself maybe). It's like a conversation with yourself, but putting it on paper makes you process it more thoroughly. It often gives me a new perspective. Also makes me feel like it's off my chest, without having to talk about it to anyone. (But if you do afterwards, you can already put the feelings to words easier because you've done it already.) Afterwards you can throw it away or keep it for rereading. "
6006,isfp,"Punch and kick boxes or pillows or whatever is handy. Make a mess, clean it up. Even the cleaning up is therapeutic to me. 
Again, I admit that as a 27 year old man, this is an extremely immature way to deal with my sadness and anger, but it works for me. Put on the fake smile for friends and family and hold it in. I've tried antidepressants, but I never stay on them. "
6007,isfp,"Hey, fellow ISFP here but a little late to the party.
My dad is also an ISFP who bottles up his emotions like we do, but watching his life I've noticed that led to a lot of really bad things happening to him, like his first marriage falling apart and later being heavily pressured into getting remarried, among other things. I'm not saying this is going to happen to you or anything, but finding someone to confide in when you're struggling is really really important. In regards to the comment above me, not only is letting that pressure build up incredibly harmful to yourself, but it certainly hurts others in that they can't form a true relationship with you built on trust. Please don't let me tell you what to do, but it's just something to consider. If you want I can try to help you find some resources if you have anything specific going on."
6008,isfp,"What are some you have?
I'm pretty extroverted a lot of the time and that's why people have typed me as an ESFP a lot. But just because I can be extroverted sometimes doesn't mean I HAVE to have an extroverted first function.
Fi Se Ni Te all the way. :)"
6009,isfp,"Yeah some people when they first meet me type me as an extrovert, then they don't see me for a month while I'm recharging and wonder why. Introvert through and through.
Some habits of mine;
procrastinating,
not leaving the house for weeks on end,
not replying to texts,
touching all the clothes when I go shopping,
rearranging things that don't seem aesthetically pleasing,
not caring what I eat as long as it tastes good,
typing out long replies to things on the internet then not posting them,
looking at photos of places where I would rather be,
making lists without really knowing if they're relevant
EDIT; shit you said non ISFP traits. oops."
6010,isfp,"I have a couple. I'm definitely an introvert, but I'm really sociable, so a lot of the time if I'm alone I feel weird and I try my best to find odor to hang with, even if I can feel I need alone time. 
Also, I get pretty defensive, so often times that conflicts with my passive nature and I get poetry confrontational... Which I don't enjoy... But its hard for me to prevent. 
I've also been more ""tell-it-like-it-is"" about certain opinions I have. I generally see both sides of an opinion, but with a couple of things I'll just bluntly tell some one something they said was stupid (usually about the arts or education). I didn't use to do that, but as I get more involved with certain things I've realized they importance of being blunt sometimes.
I might edit if I think of more, but here are a couple starters."
6011,isfp,"People think I'm extroverted because I bartend and have learned to pretend to be extroverted for my job. In reality though, when it gets really busy the constant loud yelling/chatter makes me want to crawl into a hole."
6012,isfp,"even though this topic is 2 months old I'd still like to leave this here: (mostly because I read: ""typing out long replies to things on the internet then not posting them""), rofl
I've studied Computer Science so people often think I'm a INTJ. A theoretical machine of logic that just ""happens"" to solve/create stuff with color, emotion and by bending/breaking the rules all the time.  
It frustrated me to no end when people think you've got this creation process down to a science and it's quantifiable but in reality: art is just art, frankly I don't know how I make the stuff I make half the time I make, nor can I explain it.
I randomly sign up to some dance class or design meetup; friend everyone and suddenly everyone (including your friends) think you're extroverted."
6013,isfp,"Asking from fellow ISFPs. In my opinion they would be the perfect partner for us to have carefree fun/do creative endeavours with and have a close friendship with. They're stable, supportive, loyal and caring. I've had a long close friendship with an ESFJ (I still keep in touch with her sometimes) and it was amazing. Also, Si generally seems like a somewhat misunderstood function to me. What are your thoughts on/experiences with ESFJs?
edit: on a side note, types that I've felt most energized hanging around with were ESFJs and ISTPs."
6014,isfp,"I loooove ESFJs, from a slight distance. When they‚Äôre really close to me, they can make me a tad crazy, especially because a lot of ESFJs I‚Äôve met (not all!) have really strings ideas of social norms that everyone needs to follow, and they‚Äôll kind of be passive aggressive in their judgement towards people who don‚Äôt fit social norms. Overall they‚Äôre usually very sweet, and they tend to kind of take care of me, which is nice since I‚Äôm usually the one taking care of all of my friends. Also, they‚Äôre way better at time management and help me keep my sh*t together:). I think in general, I love ExFxs, but of the ExFxs, ESFJs are probably my least favorite."
6015,isfp,"My long term girlfriend is an ESFJ and we get along really well. She is really affectionate and loyal, yet gives me my own space when I need it. We get along better than any of my previous girlfriends, who have generally been introverts.  She also is great at helping me get my shit together when it comes to planning, organizing and cleaning. "
6016,isfp,"Note: Im INFJ; Dave is ENFP; Daniel is ISFP
Two years I fell in love with Dave (F18). But I was in denial about my feelings so I did not did anything about it. Six months later he got a girlfriend (F18) and they are happily together since then. Their relationship is stable. Meanwhile I suffered in silence. I was really lovesick. For example I felt at some point even unable to sleep and to eat (I lost as a result 8 lbs ;im still barely not underweight). I always thought that I would be forever alone.
Over times is got better. I am able again to function normally in life and Im reasonably happy. But I still think every day of Dave. So I m not totally over him.
Yesterday a guy whom I will call Daniel asked me out for a date. Daniel is a friend (but not an extremely close friend) of mine since five years. 
I told him that I know this is really unfair to him but I cant answer him right now whether I want to go on a date with him. I feel terrible for leaving him in limbo and treating him like that, but I just felt unable to give him an even half part reasonable answer.
I feel like dating him is a great opportunity for me to forget Dave and I think that Daniel and I might be a good match. I like him a lot and I love spending time with him.
On the other hand I am terribly afraid of starting to date. And I still cling far too much too the past. Also I am afraid that I might be emotionally not healthy and stable enough to date. I often think that I am unlovable.
Also I fear that I might hurt Daniel or myself by doing something stupid. I absolutely don‚Äôt want to hurt Daniel or loose his friendship.
What should I do? What is the best for me and Daniel?
TL;DR I fell in love and was in denial about my own feelings. I suffered in silence. Now another guy asked me out. "
6017,isfp,"Long post incoming - INFJ here that just happened to be lurking on this subreddit and I happened to come across your post.  So sorry you're feeling this way, but you reminded me of myself when I was younger and I know what that feels like, it totally sucks. As someone who can relate to what you're going through, I thought I could offer some perspective. 
First thing's first- you deserve love. You're absolutely worthy of it. But the most important thing is going to start with cultivating love for yourself. You will never believe you deserve Daniel or Dave or anyone's love for that matter if you can't see what there is to love about you. I know I used to be baffled when people showed interest in me and didn't understand it. I started going to a therapist and devouring a lot of information on psychology and personal development before I began to control the same heinous voice in my head that told me I was unlovable. Sometimes it's still a battle and that voice creeps in, but I have to actively remind myself it's a distortion. I don't need to know you to know that you are lovable and worthy. 
Second - I don't see any harm in going on a date with Daniel considering you mentioned you've been friends for years, you get along and said yourself you think you may be a good match. I think it may be an INFJ thing, especially when we're young to try to project and see into the future. I remember up until a few years ago I'd pretty much turn down dates with anyone unless I thought it could turn into a long-term relationship.  But the thing was, I couldn't really know that unless I tried dating them, it was just my INFJ introverted intuition trying to tell me what the future might hold. Also, like you, I would get extremely attached to one person at a time, which was usually some sort of unattainable crush (which is sounds like Dave is for you) and would have horse-blinders on for them and not be able to see myself with anyone else. I think you can shift your perspective a bit - Daniel is not someone you're using to get over Dave unless you choose to look at him in that way. Rather you're staying open-minded to the possibility of something with Daniel. You already know you get along and maybe there could be something there, but even if he isn't the person you'll be with for the rest of your life, it's not the end of the world if things don't work out, instead it's an opportunity to learn about yourself and relationships. You just get to start seeing there are other people out there for you, and then day by day you'll find yourself thinking about Dave less and less.
Side note - I'm an INFJ who has been dating an ISFP for the past few months (that's how I found myself on this subreddit). And he's super caring and sweet and thoughtful. He also gets me out of my head and encourages me to live more in the present moment. He honestly doesn't even understand how my brain can go off in a million different directions and calculate all the different possible outcomes and he seems to deal with a lot less anxiety because of it. I think that's an awesome thing sensors can offer to us intuitive types and it's worth exploring relationships with people who may see the world a little differently. "
6018,isfp,"She was actually reluctant about it at first-she was kind of pushed into it by her mom after she started to waver (she freaked out a little about how long the entire path would take), but now she says she can't imagine doing anything else and really loves it. She's still in her second year, so she's still learning material in classes, and I know this semester she struggled with some of the classes. But mainly she's looking forward to the next two years, doing clinical rotations, because it's more hands on."
6019,isfp,"Hello from an ENTJ! I‚Äôve managed to run into all the 16 types except you, so where am I likely to find you? 
Where do you spend you time? 
What are your hobbies? 
Do you enjoy being outside? 
What subjects are you interested in?
Any hints on how to spot an ISFP? "
6020,isfp,"A pottery class. In my pottery class pretty much everyone was giving off isfp vibes. At my job now as an animal caretaker several of us are isfp. I pretty much only hang out at home and sometimes i go to a friends house so idk where we ""go out to hang"" or anything."
6021,isfp,"Just chipping in if it helps! I tend to catch up with close friends at coffee shops/restaurants (if not in their own home) but for me to feel like I‚Äôve actually spent quality time with them, it‚Äôs usually with only one or two people at a time. 
If I‚Äôm hanging out in a group of good friends, you can always find me cracking jokes or dissolving into fits of laughter. Making people laugh is also my go-to when I‚Äôm trying to make new people feel comfortable around me.
I like trying new things and if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm very interested in, then I don‚Äôt mind doing things on my own - eg: going to a photography/dance/writing class, going for a photo walk around town, etc. "
6022,isfp,"When I'm not practicing/listening to music, I tend to watch YouTube, play video games and watch a little anime here and there. Pretty standard imo. What kind of hobbies do you have that don't cater to your creative side? "
6023,isfp,"I mean...
In seriousness, I play video games (I'm playing Life is Strange: before the storm right now and I'm sorry but Chloe is definitely an ISFP in my humble opinion), I watch LPs on youtube, and I train our dogs. 
Saying I 'play video games' seems really minimizing seeing as there are so many kinds out there. I don't tend to play a lot of FPS or 'building' games, and I stay away from any kind of games you play over the internet with other people. I enjoy games where the focus is on the story, not 'skill' (telltale games, LiS, etc.), RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout (which are kinda like telling your own story), open-ended games like The Sims (but not as often)... But honestly the games I play most often are probably roguelikes because they're easy to pick up and put down. I play a floor of binding of isaac, go back to writing... Play floor... more writing, haha.
...Most of my other hobbies are 'artistic' in some way, though. I write, I cook, I draw. I seek out the artistic creations of others (whether original fiction and art or fan-stuff)."
6024,isfp,"Video games, watching cartoons, watching/listening to ASMR, chatting/lurking on Discord and social media, doing extensive research in bursts on obscure topics (like MBTI haha), reblogging things on tumblr, obsessing over people... wow it's harder to thing of non-artistic things than I thought. Umm, basically anything but sport. I find most sports boring to watch and stressful to play."
6025,isfp,"Fantastic question!
Last summer I (an ISFP) got into RC planes. Its been an amazing hobby to get into, I think mostly because it appeals to the need for freedom and fun that us ISFP's need! Additionally you can fly planes by your self, there is no need to have other people around. There is something amazing about heading out in the early morning (less wind) or late evening (less wind) to a wide open field by your self and just taking full control over a small RC plane, for what feels like forever, but in actuality just several minutes. It's a very tranquil experience and presents a really different hand-eye coordination experience than video games can provide.
I've also been doing long distance target shooting on my grandfathers farm. If you'r not opposed to fire arms and have access to a range, .22LR's or .223 rifles are quite inexpensive. It can be a rewarding experience to hit targets from "
6026,isfp,"I originally thought Max would be ISFP because she's very stereotypically 'artsy', but I think she fits INFP better. Still a fi-dom, though, but I definitely think intuition comes before sensing for her. I'd also say Si rather than Se because she's really not very spontaneous, she prefers to follow rules and listen to teachers, and she's also heavily focused on nostalgia and keeping memories of her past. She even prefers retro cameras.
If you wanted to get deep you could interpret her time-rewinding powers as a fantastical representation of her interest in returning to the past (especially using photographs/snapshots of the moment as a way to do that).
I talked it over with my MBTI-obsessed BFF and she was the one who initially said Chloe was probably ISFP/ESFP and now I can't unsee it. It's kind of a toss-up if she's a Fi or Se dom, but I'm coming down on the side of Fi mostly because of behaviours (I won't spoil, don't worry) in the second game. Definitely *SFP in my opinion (high Fi and Se, low Ni and Te).
The second game (since you play as Chloe) lets you get more into her head. Stuff that comes off more ISFP than ESFP to me:


Chloe now has an 'art' interest like Max - graffiti. Her journal also has art in. She (obviously) doesn't sign a name to her graffiti so it's not a way for her to get attention from others.


LOTS of incidents where you get a diplomatic option that goes against Chloe's internal values - but once you've said it Chloe feels it's necessary to re-state her internal values, even if it ruins her diplomatic stance. Comes off extremely Fi dom to me.


Chloe 'has no friends' at the beginning of the second game, which seems more like an introvert thing despite her behaviour. In fact, internally she's much less confident than she seems in the first game, and some of her behaviour is frankly a little awkward.


While she obviously seeks out new sensory experiences often, Chloe spends a lot of time alone (intentionally) with her thoughts, ruminating on her own emotions and how she feels.

Chloe has a hard time understanding how a person can be more than one thing at a time (e.g. a bully and a good big brother, an A-plus student and a rebellious troublemaker), which is a theme that's been re-stated a few times so far in the 2nd game (haven't finished it myself yet). You could definitely interpret this as her being uncomfortable with the idea of inauthenticity, which is a much less ESFP trait IMHO.

Chloe enjoys sensory experiences with other people, but the main 'bonding' between her and both girls in her life comes from conversation, IMHO. Things get intense sensory-wise with both Max and Rachel - but again, it's the feelings and values they express that make Chloe feel close to them.


Without going into too much detail, Chloe experiences dreams in the course of the second game which to me (content-wise, not inherently) suggest a higher Ni than Te.


Also on the Ni
Of course that's just my onion haha. I think there are some very valid interpretations for her as an ESFP too.


...So... Did you ride off into the sunset with Chloe or not? :p"
6027,isfp,"Damn you give a convincing argument. I don't have nearly as much knowledge about mbti to disagree üòÇ And yeah I can definitely see Max as infp over isfp.
And no I didn't ride with Chloe. üò≠ I have a really developed Te for some reason and I couldn't overlook the lives of the whole town for one (albeit amazing) person. Can't wait to play the second game so I can feel terrible the whole time about letting my best friend be murdered üëç"
6028,isfp,"So few in general or so few in this subreddit? For the latter I can think of a few reasons, like people not knowing their personality types, not wanting to let it ""define"" them as if joining the sub would do just that, or simply not knowing about the subreddit. "
6029,isfp,"INFP here. My opinion is that ISFPs have a much more tangible approach in bringing their values into the sensory/""real"" world that you won't find them online as much. Also: an ISFP can look like a goth girl with piercings everywhere, a quiet man wearing camo who goes to the gunclub every Saturday, or the acoustic guitar playing guy at the coffee house. They can tend to wear their identity on their sleeves, literally. In my experience, they are so individualized that they don't tend to appear alike in real life as other types.
INFPs tend to be recognized ""in the wild"" concerning the ways they are misunderstood/unable to interface with the world, and they usually bond about this fact together instead of bonding about ""what's important to them"". And I argue that the ""what's important to them"" part is a bigger piece of who they are than the ""I'm so misunderstood/can't adapt to this world"" side of their lives. It's just a thing that brings them together because their differing values are usually expressed in the abstract."
6030,isfp,"My sign is aries and year of pig. I am interested when other people are into horoscope, as in ""It is cool that people believe in cool stuff"". But to me, I think things like that are usually inaccurate."
6031,isfp,"Capricorn/rabbit.
I like the personality typing aspect for fun, but horoscopes are mostly bullshit. They can be fun, but that's about it.
I identify way more with being ISFP than I do being Capricorn. Although overall, I do fit the Cap personality profile pretty well, minus ambition and caring more about money and status than personal relationships."
6032,isfp,"I think horoscopes are bs, but astrology is so, so interesting to me. I love looking at people's charts and analyzing them and sort of putting the puzzle pieces together that make up their personality (on top of their MBTI type). I am a Pisces/Tiger. "
6033,isfp,"Hi! Enfp here, or entp, still undecided but most likely enfp. Ahaha
Alright so I met an isfp in one of my lectures about 2 weeks ago and we've been always together since then. I don't know if he just needs a friend at uni because he's not very sociable. I asked him if he wanted to join me and my friends for dinner the other night , he said yes and we had fun. Yesterday, he went to pickup his bike at my house and we played guitar and ukulele together while singing for 3 hours straight. This morning we went to a Buddhist temple together. I was curious how they praised and all that SO I asked him if I could come. We were gonna go out again this afternoon but I'm having a crisis so I cancelled it . I THINK I have feelings for him but I'm not sure if he is into me. He's very hard to read and honestly I'm a bit insecure because I'm not the feminine type like his exes. Advice pls. :("
6034,isfp,"In my experience as an ISFP, I wouldn‚Äôt hang out with someone that often if I didn‚Äôt really like them. I can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs romantic feelings though. 
But I would also tell you that, for me at least, I would NEVER be the first one to confess any interest. So if you wanted to know for sure you‚Äôd have to instigate it.  
Good luck! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
6035,isfp,"You have to pursue. He sounds interested, but it will still be on you. Don‚Äôt play games/hard to get. Make your intentions crystal clear or he‚Äôll ghost you.
These are my predictions, obviously I could be way off. ISFP love is pure, honest, real. He needs to know he can trust you before he opens up.
PS: He‚Äôs not with his exes for a reason. Some feelers want a thinker to balance them out. "
6036,isfp,"1) I wouldn't spend that amount of time with someone I don't like. 2) It takes me a while to figure out my feelings about someone new in my life; I assume he's as confused as you are and asking himself the same questions you are. Just give it some more time and just try to have fun. Don't overthink it. 3) I'm quite sensitive to the mood of people close to me but often misunderstand the reasons behind it. If you start to tell yourself that he doesn't like you and start to hold back, he'll probably pick up on that, think that you have some kind of problem with him, start to pull back himself and your doubts will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
I know it's a super vulnerable feeling to give your love to someone who might not reciprocate it but even though it can feel soul-crushing, it's the best thing you can do. Be genuine about your intentions; the right guy will appreciate it.
I hope it works out for you :)
Edit: About your perceived lack of femininity: in my case, ""feminine"" looks might help increase initial attraction to a woman but I fall in love because of how a woman makes me feel."
6037,isfp,"As an ISFP, I can vouch that hanging out with new people mostly feels like a chore unless I'm into them. Personally, if I'm not intrigued by someone or at least enjoy their company, id rather spend time alone so my money's on yes, he's interested :)
Also, maybe it's just me but all my best friends and people I've been drawn towards have been  ExFPs 
We're generally hard to read so it's not just him! And that's what we love about your type. You can make us feel at ease and have a way of getting us to open up pretty effortlessly, and are also quite charming. My advice is to just be yourself even if you're ""not girly"". Imo being different is a bonus and never a bad thing"
6038,isfp,"If I'm eating something tasty, I like to focus. Specially when I get the munchies, mmm. But if it's just boring old frozen lunch, I like to eat it watching youtube or netflix so I don't have to notice the taste, or that it's not properly heated, just eat it because it's healthy."
6039,isfp,"Is this type related? I might eat while also browsing the internet or watching tv. My brother, who seems to be intj, prepares his meals and eats them at the table while doing nothing else, which I find sort of odd. I have some ADD a little bit, I think."
6040,isfp,"I just noticed I'm the same way. I thought I was a doer/watcher, but that's only when I'm at home eating leftovers or ramen. If I'm eating solo at a restaurant, I'll usually bring along my tablet with my Sims cheat guides, only to put it away once the feast arrives."
6041,isfp,"First time posting here and I need some advice about how/if to ask out a good friend of mine. We are college students that live in adjacent dorms, and she comes and sits in my room with me for a relatively substantial period of time every day to do work or some other activity. We usually go out and eat alone together 3-4 times a week. These haven't felt like dates, but I've noticed recently that, rather than sitting directly across from me, she is now sitting beside me (though oriented towards me, strangely). I openly admit that I may be reading too much into relatively trivial changes in behavior, but I've noticed that the change was accompanied with her walking/standing/sitting much closer to me than she has previously. We often joke around and have what some may call a flirty relationship, but we have also talked about our own personal demons with each other, as well as heavy topics (depression, relationships with family) that wouldn't be discussed among acquaintances. 
I am totally content with being friends with her, as I believe that we have a strong bond, but tonight after dinner she made passing comments about how certain actions ""turn her on,"" making me wonder if I've been missing something. Asking a few of my close friends yielded different results--that I'm so friendzoned she is fine telling me what she finds attractive and to be a turn-on, or that she was basically giving me a road map.
I'm clueless. I've never been in a relationship. Thoughts? Thanks!
TL;DR
ISFP girl spends a lot of time with me, does things with me, and has opened up to me. She may be dropping hints. Help?"
6042,isfp,"The top piece of advice I can give you is that in the end it doesnt matter if she is interested or not, becasue what matters is wether YOU are interested and act in consequence of that interest.
You like her? Ask her out on a date. That is your one and only job. Dont worry about wether you are ""in the zone"" or not, stop analysing every thing she does to gauge wether she likes you or not. All you ened to worry about is making things happen. HER job will be to decide if she wants friendship or something more. But none of that happens until you MAKE YOUR INTEREST APPARENT.
Good luck."
6043,isfp,"I've tried to avoid clubs all my life like they were the plague (I even refused my brother on his 23rd birthday). But today, I was forced to go clubbing with my friends. And it sucked. I left after 10 minutes because I started to get super anxious from the loud music and lack of personal space. I just felt really sad just being there. It all seemed so pointless and trivial. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like ISFPs don't really mesh well with the whole clubbing scene. 
What do you guys think? "
6044,isfp,"I only like to go when I'm in the mood. Even if I know the artist or what kind of music is going to be played, I predominately prefer more intimate places with close friends. I recommend going to festival or a massive event for electronic / club music though since there's usually a bigger venue / space, the music is top notch, and the people tend to be more open and friendly. Until recently, I would have agreed with you that clubs are pointless and trivial and that dancing isn't for me; now I love to dance and express myself, and it's a great way to meet and feel the people around you without talking. I've always valued actions over words, so if I see or dance with someone and really enjoy their presence / movement, I feel a deeper initial connection with that person that I most likely won't get from only talking."
6045,isfp,"I get exactly the same reaction, I end up panicking from lack of space and usually my friends get sucked away. Everything is too loud and it's impossible to get to know anyone. Clubs suck. Pubs all the way."
6046,isfp,"I went to the rave a few months ago to see my favorite musicians. I used to be extremely introverted, but getting a job and making friends really helped that. I was still kinda anxious to go, but it wasnt nearly as bad as I thought it would be."
6047,isfp,"Ugh. When I get to be of legal drinking age, I'd rather spend my night curled up on my couch with a beer in my hand and a B movie on the TV than in some club where the girls are slobbering all over the place and the guys are getting aggressive and horny. "
6048,isfp,"recently popped my clubbing cherry too.  not really my scene either and i'm sure most isfp's would attend to agree.  but alcohol definitely takes the edge off, and it was quite a fun experience in the moment for me.  until i woke up in a public toilet somewhere at 4am with a $50 taxi ride between me and my bed."
6049,isfp,That's very interesting. I've never heard it put in that way before. I always thought that I was being a bit shallow feeling someone out just by their presence/movement instead of getting to know them first through conversation.

6051,isfp,"I was just wondering what you were like. Maybe you rely too much on your Te, or hide your Fi more.
Do you know of any good stereotype free descriptions of ISFPs?
//read this if you want. It isn't entirely relevant to my question
I'm mainly asking because it doesn't seem like any type fits me. It seems like I've become more logical in nature as I've aged (mainly since 20 or so) as opposed to it being how I naturally am. I'm generally aware of my feelings, but I have felt empty for quite some time now. I can't even answer ""how was your day"" honestly. Friends perceive me to be an INTJ in some ways due to how I act around them, but anyone I'm not comfortable with would probably describe me as shy (true), timid (mostly true), and innocent (weird).  "
6052,isfp,"Hi male ISFP here and have been since I was a wee lad. I resonate very highly with this type indicator often having max levels in I and F from past tests. I'm not exactly quiet but I do sometimes represent the extremes of this mbti. I have no issue going days without speaking, I constantly internalise any information, I have a great love for playing and listening to music often to a slight obsession. I don't have an issue understanding or thinking about my internal feelings but I have great trouble expressing them externally. Getting me to talk about what i'm thinking can be like pulling teeth if I don't want to, which I rarely do.  I am extremely loyal to my close friends but I have a real hard time participating in large groups particularly if they are mostly people I don't know. Hope that helps with your question.
Sorry for the long poorly written answer i'm a little tired lol. "
6053,isfp,"I'm female so this doesn't apply to me as much, but you can develop certain traits. For instance, I grew up very shy around people I dont know. That being said, I started a job as a cocktail waitress and then a bartender years ago. I am now able to look people in the eye and hold small talk. I'm still a bit shy outside the bar I work, but much less so. People swear to me that there is no way I'm introverted. I find I even enjoy being around people a bit sometimes now. I've quite developed my extroverted side as much as I probably will but now I seem more on the line than the HUGE extrovert I used to be. 
Other than that, I am very aware of my senses and love beauty, food, etc etc. I love and hold a special bond with most animals, ride horses as it fits my love of animals/the outdoors/my love of working with my hands. I am very independent in a work environment and don't do well with having people telling me what to do nor do I enjoy telling others what to do. I could go on for days.
Have you checked out this website? I found it helpful in looking at traits, particularly their career section"
6054,isfp,"I'm interested in replies to this too. Once I got married in my mid-twenties, my personality really changed. I still identify as ISFP or INFP, but I struggle to quickly identify my feelings. Yea, I struggle with ""how was your day"", unless I'm just giving a generic ""great"" reply. I have to think about it, and even then, my reply can seem both analytical and indecisive. I think I'm a definite Fi, but I don't know what to make of this detachment from my feelings. It's clearly dysfunctional and doesn't feel natural, but it hasn't gone away for 8 years. Marriage can change a lot of things (interpersonal systems), so who knows if I'll ever find my way back without changing my relationship."
6055,isfp,"Self-description: I am a guy that many people like a lot and is super goofy all of the time. I am also pretty insecure and very internally serious. I can be very defensive, but I'm all around a pretty chill and accepting guy. I have my views and they mean a lot to me, but I try hard not be a jerk about them. I love to learn and play music. I have difficulty being vulnerable with people or expressing how I feel. When I am upset or anxious, its hard for me to ""logic"" it away, even if I've already come to the conclusion that being upset or anxious at that situation is dumb. Despite that, I feel like I am a logical person, however, its difficult for me to follow every step in logic or convey exact every step to other people
When I discovered I was an ISFP, I had the same concerns you do. From what I gather, the ""feelings"" aspect of being an ISFP is less based on how you feel or if you're feeling something all of the time, and more so that our initial reaction to things is based off of how whatever any given situation makes us feel. I definitely have many seasons of apathy. The ""can't answer honestly how I feel"" thing is pretty normal for us, at least for me. A) its hard for me to put the way I feel into words and B) its not something that mind wants to do, even if I do (that's really confusing so I can elaborate more if you need)."
6056,isfp,"Female INTJ here. My SO is an ISFP, and he's a lot like how you described yourself (well, the way you perceive others would describe you): shy, timid, and innocent. Not entirely, but that's the first impression he gives off to a lot of people who don't know him well. 
With me, just because we've been good friends for so long and also because we're dating, he shows a lot of his Fi in the way he makes decisions and definitely uses Te to help him out. He's keen into making checklists and using checks + balances prior to making decisions on things. He has a real eye for aesthetics but he's also very mechanical and handy. He's also very laid-back and nonconfrontational, and I would definitely use the word ""gentle"" to describe him because compared to me ‚Äî the crazy, intense nut that I am ‚Äî he's really tame. "
6057,isfp,"Yes. I don't really know how I would describe myself though
What do""Te"" and ""Fi"" mean? Sorry, I'm not very familiar with this kind of stuff "
6058,isfp,"I am a male ISFP, but I used to think I was an INTP for a long time.  I think I use my Ni more than Te.  I play a lot of video games and love science so thinking I was INTP was possibly due to my bias towards those interest while ignoring my writing and drawing hobbies."
6059,isfp,"Thanks. I looked it up a bit, but I don't really have a solid understanding of it yet so I won't comment on it now
I looked at ISTP and ISFP on personalitypage.com, and I definitely feel that I identify more with ISFP though. "
6060,isfp,"as I am/was depressed but I don't want to read deceptive self-help books, I'm listening this one
‚Äã
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF65lvwQPbw
‚Äã
it's about a jewish that lived in a  concentration camp and learned something.
‚Äã
‚Äã"
6061,isfp,"that's a good one. however, i don't see myself building a relationship like VF was able to draw to mind to help him persevere/endure.  
I know i'd be one of the ones who wouldn't last.  
(i just hope i'd go out fighting)"
6062,isfp,"I'm a graphic designer, and I honestly have no idea. Some days I absolutely love my job, and other days I loathe it and don't feel cut out for it. Some days I wish I did something with more variety and flexibility. Some days I wish I was doing something more hands on."
6063,isfp,"I worked in counterterrorism, but I recently left that field cause it became too much. Constantly dealing with incredibly graphic content and just constantly being exposed to how dark humanity can be. 
I'm now unemployed with interviews lined up. 
So, to answer your question, no, I was not in the right field. I wish to find a field where I can put my previous work behind me and do something more fun and hands-on. "
6064,isfp,"I went to school for fashion design, and now i‚Äôm working in graphic design/marketing. 
I spend a lot of time wishing i was a dancer, but I‚Äôm also excellent at interior decorating. I could probably be happy in any creative field if i didn‚Äôt have to constantly appease clients‚Äô tastes and desires."
6065,isfp,"I'm currently listed, because there's a conscription based system in my country. I'm curious if there's anyone else in the military and how do they cope with the schedule and sharing your accomodation with others"
6066,isfp,"I was really going to be surprised to see the responses here. 
How are you doing in the military? 
My ISFP H comes from a long line of military men, but did not go that way. I cant imagine him in the miliatry. 
You going to be OK? How long are you in for? "
6067,isfp,I think that the military would be really good for me and that i would enjoy certain aspects of it. I worked at a summer camp where I shared a small canvas tent with three people and had shared showers with no personal living space. I did alright for the 3 months the camp was open that summer. 
6068,isfp,"It's going ok i would say. I went there with literally no expectations, so it is very hard to say does it match meet my expectations :D. At some moments it is very enjoyable and you are looking forward to your next assesment/task, but then there are times when you feel like quitting because it feels like it's too restrictive and waking up at 6 o'clock everyday and doing something physical, like marching and running sometimes get's on my nerve, because i usually do those things when i'm in the mood for it. I'm doing 6 months in the rocket launchng unit, i've done 1/3 so still a long way to go. In overrall you just do day by day."
6069,isfp,"In some aspects it's a bit similiar. We have a lot of camps, that weren't as bad as i initially expected to. Sometimes it is a bit annoying following orders and the strict militsry schedule, but you get used to it over time. Just waiting to get this done, so i can have a few months to relax, but i think in the end i will appreciate this experience as a whole, and i think it has made me in to a better person."
6070,isfp,"I bet there's a lot of art that embodies the personality, 
could probably just crop it to banner size and put ISFP in a nice but non-intrustive font next to the reddit alien on the side 
Some examples http://imgur.com/a/tLGYC#0
or
If there were more people here and everyone likes similar music (eg melancholy/whatever) then it could be a rotating banner of album of the week. "
6071,isfp,"That painting of houses in the fog is legit. All of those pieces are really nice, actually. 
To be honest, I am personally not too keen on the album of the week idea... Not everybody listens to the same music, it would be difficult to choose an album that represented everyone's opinions. "
6072,isfp,"Anyone? Any ISFP doctors/PA's/nurses out there? Do you enjoy it? What specialty are you in? I recently graduated from college with a degree in Nutrition and I completed all pre-med courses. I did very well and I enjoy learning about health and medicine, but the healthcare environment does not seem to suit my personality. I work in a doctors office and volunteer in a hospital. Everyday I am drained from the constant interaction with people, the repetitive work, the bright fluorescent lights, and the lack of creativity. Are there any other careers in healthcare that are better suited for an ISFP?"
6073,isfp,"I'm in veterinary medicine, and while it's exhausting to deal with a treadmill of people all day, the thought of making a difference keeps me going. Interestingly, we all did the test  in uni, and in a class of 210, I was the only one.  "

Likely to enjoy showing their affection through acts and deeds  
Need to have their own space, and dislike having it invaded
I'm more like- once I've accepted someone, I share the personal space; and that's my idea of affection.
I'm not good at initiating affection.  
Sure. But it can be silly, too.  
Nahh... 
I guess I need someone to be consistent with their behaviours.
That the people in the relationship want to be around one-another is enough."
6076,isfp,"Ya I found that article to be somewhat close, but sometimes it takes it a step too far. 
Example: My sister is ISFP and she wants her space from strangers and people in general, but readily wants her loved ones accessible. 
That‚Äôs why I asked. I think online ISFPs tend to be portrayed more like ESFPs sometimes. ISFPs are highly relational, yet fiercely mentally independent from my experience. "
6077,isfp,I have a career in GIS and losing myself in tedious data problems is one of my favourite parts about my job. It allows me to creatively problem solve and to not have to talk to anyone for long periods of time. 
6078,isfp,"I have two jobs currently. For one I automate excel reports and the other I'm building websites and databases with coding languages like PHP, JavaScript and HTML.
It's a drag if you let it be a drag. But if you think of it with a more creative mindset then it helps!"
6079,isfp,"edit: only 14 ISFPs has taken this survey so far. We need 16 more please!
Hello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!"
6080,isfp,"Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.
I will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.
https://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23
Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two."
6081,isfp,"Have you noticed this?
Usually, extroverts will be act confidently 100% even if they are only 55% certain of an idea/proposal/fact/etc.
ISFP's refuse to do this and we're underestimated as a result. The minute some concern, indecisiveness, or apprehension is communicated, we're seen as inferior or unwilling to commit. Shouldn't this quality be rewarded? rant end."
6082,isfp,"I am just like you and I hate that phrase so much. I was always afraid of looking like an asshole: I'd be confident about something that I'm clearly wrong about but don't know because I'm faking it. Also, I always thought there was something inherently wrong about the phrase. If I was capable enough to be confident in doing something, why would I need to fake it? I would have already ""made it"" if I was capable of ""faking it"". I literally cannot be confident unless I can do the thing, so that doesn't help my situation at all in not knowing how to do something. The phrase just didn't make sense to me. 
However, I realize the aim of the phrase and the purpose. This phrase has never personally helped me, but I get that you're just supposed to pretend like you know whatever you're doing until you no longer feel like you need to pretend, or whatever. It just doesn't help me at all with things I have some serious anxiety about. 
I think in general, not ISFPs specifically, those who don't look confident in what they're doing, even if they know exactly what they're doing, will not be thought of as highly as those who do. 
Could you elaborate more on that question you posed at the end? What quality should be rewarded and why? "
6083,isfp,"Rewarded? No. Introverted sensing isn't any more deserving of merit than extraverted thinking is. You would do yourself a lot of good to improve your own analytical thinking abilities as well as building your cognizance of who your audience is and how they will receive your outward actions and words. For example, in a meeting full of extraverted thinking types, sitting quietly and thinking on the problem could be perceived by them as non-participation or disinterest, whether or not that is the case. If that sort of thinking and behavior thrives in that particular setting, then you need to either develop yourself in that area, pushing outside of comfortable forms of interaction and thinking, or simply choose a different group of people to be around."
6084,isfp,"The quality to pause and reassess the decision/strategy that someone may be unsure about. Many workplaces involve teamwork and have the ability to brainstorm and analyze the situation. Instead, we reward extroverts who 'have all the answers' even if they actually may be unsure."
6085,isfp,"Really? Extroverts are rewarded everyday for their natural tendencies, so it's not unusual for me to believe positive introvert qualities should be rewarded too. Societally, few companies even explore outside the traditional extroverted set-up."
6086,isfp,"thank you, that's a relief to hear as I just came home from work completely exhausted because I had to fake being an extrovert. And I did a shit job too, toward the end I just wasn't having it.
What's your type?"
6087,isfp,"Unfortunately, all people care about, especially in workplaces, is what you're capable of putting out. Pausing eats up time and even if it might prevent a mistake, people will still see it as a delay. It sucks, but I guess to the extrovert, they take the risk of being wrong because the worst that can happen is that if they're wrong, they can use their confidence to own up to the mistake. However, the best thing that can happen is that they're right and they look confident doing so. "
6088,isfp,"They are being rewarded. You don't get rewarded for the process, you get rewarded for your results. I'm an electrician. I get handed a set of prints, told when our inspections are scheduled for, what is available for manpower and materials, and otherwise given an open sandbox to make it all happen. Different electricians make the end product happen at different rates, by different methods. some guys jump right into it, whereas I prefer to sit back and think everything through for a little while. But that middle part doesn't really matter, because the only thing we care about is the end, when all the lights turn on just fine. I dont know what kind of job you work, but it sounds like you're in some brainstorming meetings that are regularly dominated by extroverted thinkers, who talk first and think later. If that sort of output carries value in those meetings, then you can either change yourself to adapt, or find a different job. "
6089,isfp,"that happens to me, too, even as an extrovert. i'm an entp. i think you should just be you and not fake anything. it baffles me when people think that ALL PEOPLE should be one way or another in order to be considered ""confident,"" or to exude nearly any other attribute, really. 
i've encountered so many ""extroverts"" who were generally labeled ""confident"" by whatever group or standard, but to me it all looks like arrogance/cockiness from the beginning. it seems to me that the most confident and secure people are the ones who stay true to themselves and don't let others dictate their standards for being. keep being you, you don't need to conform to others' standards. when you're naturally you, you'll find people who understand your tendency toward not putting on an extroverted act and they will appreciate you for you from the beginning. or is this too typical of an entp response? :p i truly believe it! keep being you, you're great!"
6090,isfp,"I have an ISFP boss and it sucks. Rather than trying to leverage both our skills to move forward, it is always about them. The crappy thing is that this person is much older than I am so I highly doubt they will change or come around."
6091,isfp,"Can you elaborate some?  I thought ISFPs put others ahead of themselves.  I've seen this done to a fault where an employees' needs were put ahead of what is in the best interest of the company.  Maybe you and your boss just aren't a good match, and you should move on."
6092,isfp,"The only way I could see myself making everything about me is if I were put in the position of creative director and you tried to tell me how to do my job. Don't get between me and my composition.
It doesn't sound right."
6093,isfp,"The ISFP key: ""highly aware of physical surroundings""
I've read that phrase so many times, but for some reason the light bulb just went on. 
Recent incident: I have this mirror that is very precariously placed upon an endtable which is on uneven flooring which is next to my bed. Since I am aware of its precariousness, that is not a problem, I never bump into or endanger it in any way. It can exist in my life the way it is just fine. 
Enter I/ENTP boyfriend. I made sure he knew it was precarious, since he would be using the bed which could bump the endtable which could cause the mirror to crash. Plus since he's also a stompy-stomperson, he just naturally bumps into things and doesn't care (bugs me tons!). So I made sure to tell him about the mirror's situation 5+ times. But I felt I was being overburdening with that, so I stopped telling him about it, he totally got the message, right? Well.. the truth is that the message didn't matter, whether he got it or not. It is completely not in his nature to remember or be aware of the cause and effect of him getting on the bed, he does it like nothing matters. So mirror crashes and smashes. I was so upset, because I told him so many times and he hit it anyways, but also because I just should've freakin moved the mirror while he was visiting because I knew better. That mirror only lasted 3 weeks :(
This is just one such story. There have been countless other minor things about me placing something somewhere and him just not getting it at all. (hiding wires behind things - when he needs to use them he unhides them and doesn't put them back. items stacked so perfectly so they all fit in a small space - he knocks them over when he needs to use them and/or puts them back in different spots nearby. rugs that are perfectly placed for aesthetics which he moves when he walks on and never fixes - I never move them when I walk, how is it possible that he does it every time?! and more other random little things)
Our whole relationship I've always chocked that aspect of him up to him just not caring about things like that. Something that was very frustrating for me, but something that I've accepted since I want him in my life. But now I totally understand our innate differences here. I intrinsically am aware of these things. It's second nature for me and takes no extra cognitive power to remember. For him, not only is he not aware of it, it doesn't merit space in his cognition as something to be remembered. We are just wired differently. And I might've booby-trapped him by accident, hehe. "
6094,isfp,"Hah, I too live with my ENTP bf. Last night he broke a vase I temporarily put on the floor next to my desk I was refinishing. And every time he washes up in the bathroom it's like a tsunami happened in there, the toilet paper roll gets all soaked and he gets toothpaste splattered all over his shirt lol. He isn't a messy guy though, every once in a while he will rage clean like just start vacuuming all angry about something.
Ohh and I know what you mean about not mentioning something anymore because you assume he gets it by now... Nope, whenever I assume he's aware of the obvious that I mentioned a couple times already, I learn again the hard way that when you assume, you make an ass of u and me. Basically I have to ingrain a habit into him before I can stop mentioning it. Actually he does the same to me too with other things, like he needs to hear the car beep to make sure it's locked and the side mirror needs to be pushed in, so those are things I do to make him quit bitching but I wouldn't do normally. We have a lot of habits and procedures in place lol.
PS I heart ranty/realizations posts like this!"
6095,isfp,"May I recommand this ! Some people are slow learners but Ramzy Snow taught me that everybody learns, eventually. Seriously though, even an ENTP can learn these practical things, it's not like they can't, you just have to be annoying about it.  "
6096,isfp,Half the time I'm not even entirely sure what room I'm in.  I don't tend to bump into things often though... I don't think?  Hmmm.  When I lived with an ISFJ she played a game where she would move things like furniture and see how long it took for me to notice.  
6097,isfp,"OMG the bathroom! I know what you mean! Haha, I'm so glad others feel like they are tsunamis too, helps me feel like I'm not insane for being like ""why is the floor completely wet even though there is a towel in the middle of it for all that water, how did you not step on it?"" and the toothpaste on the mirror, and the wet toilet paper (yes! that happens to me too!)
And yeah, assuming, it's rough. 
So good, thanks for sharing!"
6098,isfp,"Lol, what are the chances?! I'm sorry to hear that though, smashing mirrors is never a fun time.
You should see one play DDR. They look completely out of control and are stomp/dancing through it all, but somehow manage to be rather accurate at it and get really good scores... it's boggling."
6099,isfp,"Lmao, I mentioned all of this to my ENTP boyfriend and he said he just doesn't care about the water thing. Basically, he doesn't care about it. ""It'll dry up"" he says, and I'm like yeah but I don't want to step in it, I don't want other people who use the bathroom to step in it, etc. 
Also, not sure if this is an ENTP thing or just my bf, he has this anti-authority complex where if you tell him to do something he won't do it. Water related incident: he just started drinking from a water fountain when I said ""oh yeah, stay hydrated"" and he immediately stopped drinking and nearly spat all of the water out on the floor."
6100,isfp,"Well, we do tend to have issues with authority, but being that way with your SO is a bit immature.
Also, related note, I was reading through a profile describing INTP behavior and got to a section talking about how they are with home organization, and it mentioned how if an object remains unmoved for more than a couple days, then it's essentially out of their field of vision. I about busted a gut cause that pretty accurately describes the way I see objects around the house, I literally don't notice stuff that hasn't moved in a while.
Yes, there's been toothpaste on my mirror for quite a while"
6101,isfp,"So, I‚Äôm at a pretty big time in my education. Lots of work and stress. I‚Äôve been handling it alright though. But I also just started a job. It‚Äôs currently a school break but I‚Äôm mostly spending it working long 8 hour days. Infact, tomorrow is my first day off of school/work since last Sunday. 
Currently, I‚Äôm surprisingly okay. Very tired, but positive. However I‚Äôm worried that with even more work and stress on the way, I won‚Äôt be able to manage it since I don‚Äôt have much time off. I find I can only truly relax when I have nothing to do. But that isn‚Äôt the case and won‚Äôt be for at least a good month or two. 
Any tips on how to relax and keep a positive mind through super busy times? Anything is greatly appreciated!"
6102,isfp,"I've found out that nothing relaxes and clears my mind as much as being out in the nature. I live in a city with lots of forests around and I like to just wander trough them whenever I'm free. 
I have to force myself out quite often because of my lazy ass, but I never regret it and always come back home with clearer mind. :) "
6103,isfp,"Is there any way you can arrange a place to study outdoors?  Or would that be too distracting? For me, even being able to just sit in the sun, close my eyes and listen to the sounds helps clear my head, even if it‚Äôs just for a minute at a time,  (ISTJ)"
6104,isfp,"I try my best to remain focused in the present moment by paying attention to my physical surroundings and tasks.
Whenever these thoughts become more intrusive, I take some time to look through my planner, to remind myself of all the progress I've made in completing my tasks and that I can continue to do so.
Ideally, please assign breaks for yourself while working on your tasks. Pacing yourself is important since ""work never ends""!
When I catch myself dwelling on upcoming tasks (aka overthinking and procrastinating) instead of the task at present, I try making mental notes about my surroundings. Eg: ""That's a beautiful sunset"", ""I wonder if those are cumulonimbus clouds"". It's weird but that calms me down and I can get back to the task easier."
6105,isfp,"Yeah I 100% agree. I‚Äôm also very lucky to be in such a fantastic area nature wise. Sadly I don‚Äôt have much time atm, but I‚Äôll be sure to reserve some time and make sure I get to it.
I agree with the forcing yourself haha. Sometimes I‚Äôll just give myself a kick, go do it, and not regret it at all. Thanks a lot :)"
6106,isfp,"Thanks a lot for the advice! Grounding yourself does absolutely help; I‚Äôll be sure to make a bigger effort to do so when I‚Äôm feeling burnt out. It‚Äôs kinda hard to pace myself, as my job is mainly in a catering/cafe type area - which obviously means little chance to rest! Always something to be done. But - it‚Äôs in a wildlife park. And you bet I take any opportunity I can to glance at the beautiful tigers through the window! (Seriously, they‚Äôre right there!)
Focusing on what has been done is also a good motivator. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine, but it‚Äôs more just the overthinking of ‚Äúwhat if it all gets too much‚Äù that‚Äôs bothering me. I appreciate the tips tho; I‚Äôll keep them in mind!"
6107,isfp,"Give them a chance to open up to you. Don‚Äôt know if I can speak for everyone, but I feel paralyzed when someone asks me about my problems even if I desperately want to tell someone‚Äîit takes a LOT of reassurance to get me to reveal something personal.
I‚Äôve also found that telling someone else your problems really helps just because it makes you feel so, so much less alone. And depression, for me, stems from loneliness. 
By noticing your isfp friend is having a hard time and wanting to help, you are already helping him/her! My advice would just be to offer your companionship. Of course, sometimes we all need some room to ourselves, so if your friend isn‚Äôt into talking I wouldn‚Äôt push it."
6108,isfp,"Let them know that you‚Äôre sincerely there for them, but also give them space if they need it. I like to process my feelings/emotions/stressors internally before I express them to others, if I ever do. For me, it takes a very deep friendship or relationship built on a long standing foundation of trust for me to open up about anything."
6109,isfp,"One of the easiest ways to tell the differences for me is the way they speak. ISTPs will speak in a more blunt and direct way compared to ISFPs. 
Obviously this is a very basic way of looking at it. But it‚Äôs helped me in the past. "
6110,isfp,"you can see it with their interaction styles and how they talk. 
you would see ISFPs make all sorts of facial moves and gestures with their face such as their eyebrows. 
‚Äã
for ISTPs i find it common for them to randomly give out dad jokes and similar one liners in front of groups.   
‚Äã
ISTPs ask questions in a more blunt way when asking questions.  
""did you go to the __ last night? was __ there?""
versus the ISFP 
""did you go to the _____  last night? was it fun?"""
6111,isfp,"feelers have a really different vibe to thinkers. feelers tend to have softer facial expressions, thinkers are more.. hardened i guess? thinkers will usually talk about the logic of things and will want to be useful, feelers talk about values and more emotive things and tend to be more considerate of others' values. "
6112,isfp,"I was struggling with this too. I couldn‚Äôt decide if I was isfp or istp. Recently did a MBTI course with work for team building/leadership training course. I‚Äôm isfp btw 
Some of these differences helped me. 
When in a stressful situation do you internally 
-blame the situation (istp) or yourself (isfp). Ie this activity is stupid vs I can‚Äôt do it I suck. 
I‚Äôm not sure how this works?
I think istps tend to be less self conscious. 
Really the big difference is the way you make decisions. Isfps tend to just do what they feel is right. Try not to offend people like it‚Äôs their life mission. Istps will be okay with offending people if it‚Äôs the most practical approach. 
For example in a team I will happily do a task the long hard way just because someone else came up with it even if I know a much easier practical way of doing it just to avoid possibility hurting their feelings."
6113,isfp,"hi everyone, i'm an isfp (i think). i don't feel as if online descriptions entirely of isfp match me; but the functions do very well and so that's what i'm going by! anyways, to the point:
i'm still young, but many times over the years i have been called either serious or too serious. at first i took it as a compliment, being serious can be a good thing. but then i realized some people don't think i can be fun, or i can't take a joke because they think i'm serious all the time. maybe that's all in my head though. but i hate it. i think some of it might have to do with my face/voice not showing a lot of emotion or people not catching onto it. 
i always enjoy a good laugh even though i may not make jokes or gags myself. i love having fun, i may be much more reserved than others though. but what i do know is that i'm in the moment, enjoying every single thing that is happening around me. it's not like i'm just sitting there not enjoying myself. and that's why i hate being called serious. i feel like people don't see the real me. i mean, that's fine but that's not really who i am inside!!! i yearn to have fun in actuality. that was just a side point...
and i think i may come off as serious maybe because when people are talking to me i really think about what they are saying/doing and immersing myself in the conversation??? i don't really know.
it's almost as if people either see me as not having any worries so they don't bother being serious with me or they think i'm not fun enough. it goes both ways. and it kinda sucks.
this is kind of just turning out to be me rambling on and on so i'll stop here but any of you guys ever feel this way? get called serious? do you like it or not?"
6114,isfp,"I'm an ISFP and I've always had that problem too especially in high school. I'm 20 now, and it's definitely gotten better, but I find that hanging out with a smaller group of my close friends (or even just one) helps me loosen up more. So I tend to do that most of the time. "
6115,isfp,"I think some people perceive me as serious. I'm very observant and generally a quiet person. I'm not too great at talking because  when I'm trying to explain things/talk I can never seem to find the right word. I care a lot about my future career.  Those things combined might make me seem serious. Although some times I can be very lighthearted and play along with groups,  I generally dislike groups because people speak over on another and the whole not being great at speaking means that my jokes/timing aren't really that good."
6116,isfp,i (think) i'm an isfp too and i used to be reallyyyy serious. i still am pretty serious at home but outside i'm pretty easy going until pissed off. how old are you? id you're really young then that's prob an explanation 
6117,isfp,People have said this to me since I was young and I hate it too. I got bullied when I was little for being too serious. And people who like to go to clubs say I don't know how to let loose. Some people just can't comprehend that not everyone likes partying :/ Or they feel like I'm judging them. Don't let it get it you. You have your own standards and ideas of having fun and that's fine. Life's too short to seek validation from people. Do whatever the hell you want to ;)
6118,isfp,"lol that is interesting. i'm the opposite, at home im not so serious. out and about i'm easygoing too but more conscious and careful about my actions. so that probably plays a part.
but yep i'm only 16, as i get older maybe it will get better"
6119,isfp,"Disclaimer: I know many of us can find it hard to comment on posts because we tend to feel like what we have to say may have been said or thought already by someone else, but just know that I'm interested in every single word you have to say, whether it's been said already or not. Thanks for being you.
I'm not sure if this is an original thought or if it's something that's common among us, but I find myself feeling very misplaced in a sort of limbo between introvert and extrovert.
There's no denying that I very much enjoy my alone time. When you're alone, you don't have to worry about entertaining another person, about if what you're saying sounds stupid, or if you're gonna stutter over your rehearsed words. There's so much peace in being alone, and I love the freedom to choose to do whatever the hell I want without someone paying attention to me. It's easier being alone. I've canceled many a plan last minute.
However, aside from the slight relief that myself and many people get from canceling plans, I take little joy from the act. Because while being alone is peaceful, it's also lonely. I've noticed that I don't get any energy from being alone. I may have small, infrequent doses of motivation and ambition, but usually only in the form of cleaning or organizing. I typically do not feel very happy when I'm alone. 
I do love going out, being around people, and having many new experiences. I feed so heavily off the energy of the people around me and the environment I'm in. Is that just empathy, or extroversion? Because, correct me if I'm wrong, the raw definition of extroversion is gaining energy from people around you, whereas introversion is gaining energy from yourself. And that's where my conflict of thought comes in, because energy is rarely something I can give myself. But the other side of that conflict comes in where I can get absolutely exhausted from being around people and socializing for an extended period. So other people is where I get my energy from, but it's also what sucks the energy out of me once I have it.
So really I'm just trying to see if other people feel like this and I'm just over thinking everything, or if maybe I need to think deeper into why I am how I am."
6120,isfp,"I feel the same way. I'm not one to cancel plans, but when I'm an hour into hanging with friends I get the urge to leave and you described the whole energy thing perfectly as well. I'm drained and unhappy alone, while with people I get a burst of energy from the  start and drain all the energy almost as soon as I get it."
6121,isfp,"Everyone has some of the other in them
 Extroverts do have some introvert and visa versa.
The question is more which do you go to recharge. This will very greatly from person to person due to your job.
If you work in customer service where you are helping others, at the end of the day you will want to go home and recharge introvertly. It's the opposite of a desk job where you are just playing with numbers by yourself. 
So it's okay to have a bit. If you introverted you can still go out and enjoy being extroverted. 
For this reason I like to do the following. 
Take the test on a day you feel like you want to be left alone. 
Then take one on a day you want to be with others.
This gives you your extroverted self and introverted self. You like everyone else is to complex to be one or the other. We all have our social(extroverted self) and our private (introverted self).
Then take those too and see the varient. If you want to talk about it directly to me, shoot me a message. I'll always respond ASAP."
6122,isfp,"I consider myself very introverted; I'm pretty quiet, and I'm usually getting lost in my thoughts, sometimes having trouble following what's going on around me. But the funny thing is I HATE being alone. My ideal situation is to have people nearby, but not to have to interact with them. If I don't have anyone within shouting distance I get depressed and anxious. I like having my own room, and I spend a lot of time in there by myself, but I HATE being home alone. I like to be able to hear people as background noise. I also hate working alone, and I feel much happier working with people (even though I don't say much). In college, I actually preferred studying in the parts of the library that had more students around talking, or even in the cafeteria, instead of the quiet and empty parts of the library. But I usually didn't  bring a buddy with me because I was very independent. Having people around keeps my brain more awake and less spacey/gloomy,  but I like to maintain my personal bubble too.
I feel like I just rambled without saying anything.... take it as you will XD"
6123,isfp,"I don't feel hopelessly trapped between introversion and extroversion... But I do feel that I am in between them. I think as I get older I get more introverted, but when I'm with people I enjoy being around I can be very extrovert-esque. Around other introvert friends that aren't as in between as I am I feel even more so, but I think it's good for me and my personality. "
6124,isfp,"Hi Datsloth, I hope I'm not too late but, you could be an ambivert. It's definitely original to you to think up something not normally brought up but I think you're not alone in feeling that way (no worries!) Ambivert brings up many searches to google too but I'll include some links here 1 2"
6125,isfp,"I feel the same way too. But I think there's always one that you prefer. The definitions are tricky because I'm an introvert myself but I gain energy from my friends and friendly chatter. Here's the test: if you can go into a crowded place and be confident enough to strike up small talk naturally, you're probably an extrovert. A person who prefers introversion might have to FORCE themselves to make small talk. That doesn't mean they don't enjoy small talk, it's just that it doesn't come as natural. Everyone must experience both extroversion and introversion because humans are social creatures and also need their own time. Without it, it would get either lonely or you would need a breather. It's all about which one you're most comfortable with."
6126,isfp,I totally feel this post. A lot of times I'll just want to escape a situation and be by myself because I'm tired and want to be left alone. But a lot of times when I'm alone I crave social interaction and love spending time with others. It's difficult haha
6127,isfp,"YES, so much yes.
I have been going over in my own mind the last half year or so, contemplating if i am a complete introvert anymore- when i grew up, i was a total introvert. i would never talk to anyone, only exception was my close family. i could totally go all day without speaking to anyone. as i grew up though, i evolved into needing to have friends (granted only a few), i feel there arent that many people that dont want friends tho. anyway, because of where i grew up and how, every couple years of regular school the few (like two or three friends) i had left, although i guess that is a side effect of life- people leaving. during this time i was forced to leave my comfort spot (where all my friends had left) and find new friends. luckily i found some, and i just became naturally more extroverted among them, and very slowly and gradually i became minutely more extroverted with everyone else. my group of friends was small and our group has effectively dissolved. two moved far away, one has infinite friends and wasnt much of a friend when he didnt need to be, and one other has kinda turned into a bitch (i could go into details, but wont). Recently i have become a lot more extroverted, partly because i have had to for work and other non-work, work that i do. 
i would say i am 70% introvert and 30% extrovert. just an observation i have made- i can be a complete extrovert if i am talking to one person and that one person is an introvert. but then again its difficult talking to introverts, as i know and am learning myself. 
ya, so there are my thoughts. i am sadly in need of new friends once again, and it is always a pain, trust me. no one has gone out of their way to try to be friends with me for a while, and while i do like talking to people i also like being alone and most of the time prefer not to have to talk to anyone (am i restating whats already been said?). so making friends, sigh... its difficult for me to start the conversations (not knowing what i am going into), but i have to do it to fulfill personal needs...
hope you enjoyed every single word"
6128,isfp,"Im hoping someone hasn't written a thread like this already. I'm just wondering the best pun that you have come up with? For me, I was at a football game as a highschool cheerleader and a common thing that the announcer would say was ""flag on the play"" quickly and with a deep tone. So at some point during the game there was a plastic bag strolling across the field and I took it upon myself to say ""bag on the play"" in the same manner. I got one pity laugh. That was a successful day to me thankyou. CaN yOU ToP IIIIIT!"
6129,isfp,"One comes to my mind right now. My family was talking about Moses and the children of Israel‚Äôs journey through the wilderness, and my dad said ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt have iPads to get through those forty years!‚Äù And I immediately replied with ‚Äúbut Moses did have a tablet‚Äù
My family laughed hard for a few minutes.
I‚Äôve had some really good puns, but they‚Äôre not coming to mind right now. "
6130,isfp,"One pun that I clearly remember:
My cousin and her husband were visiting my country in winter and we went to an ice skating rink (together with my INTP sibling). The cousin's husband didn't know how to skate, so he was led by my cousin and when they completed one round around the rink, I shouted ""N-ICE going!"" to them. 
They both laughed. My sibling (INTP) just kinda shook her head and said ""You must be really proud of that pun huh... ""
I had made another ice pun but I don't really remember it."
6131,isfp,"Hello. First time poster! 
I‚Äôve re-written this post so many times cause I can‚Äôt seem to make it make sense! But here goes...
I am intrigued about how you fellow ISFPs feel about texting? I don‚Äôt mind sending texts when I have to. In general, I prefer to write down what I have to say as I am able to choose my words carefully, and I find it much easier to collect my thoughts. However, I hate receiving texts. The feeling of having to reply straight away makes me feel anxious and as well as that, I often seem to misread the context of texts or I sense the wrong tone. This usually results in unneccesary arguments or I end up feeling annoyed and confused because I don‚Äôt understand what the other person is trying to say/or why they‚Äôre choosing to text me this? I think in general I prefer to have conversations face to face.
So, my best friend loves to text. She‚Äôs the kind of person who will send several bursts of texts, that she could just write in one text. She will always be the first person to text at the beginning of the day. If she didn‚Äôt text me, we probably wouldn‚Äôt talk for days. She also texts more friviously, whereas when I text someone it‚Äôs for a purpose. Some of the things she‚Äôs texts really annoy me sometimes and I often wonder why she is texting me such things and I‚Äôll find myself feeling annoyed with her, when really there is nothing to be annoyed about.  When I see her in person we‚Äôll be chatting away and getting on like a house on fire, and there are no misunderstandings.
I guess I‚Äôm just asking/wondering if anyone else feels the same way about texting? Or often misreads tone/context? What are your texting habits?"
6132,isfp,"Worth the effort to make the post, IMO. You got ISFPs to engage on this sub, which isn't easy! We may not all agree, but we must all deeply care about communication since you got us to come out of the woodwork.
Personally I'm with you, I hate texting and I'd even say I wish it didn't exist. I hate the sense of urgency it creates, and the lack of clarity. My new boss texts me all the time and the combination of urgency with unclear instructions is crazy-making. In a different context, it also distances me from people. Some close family members would rather text than call, which makes me feel lonely. Boo to texting!"
6133,isfp,"I'm the same way. I usually don't text people back right away just because I don't feel like talking, though. It's annoying to me when people want my constant attention. That might sound pretty harsh, but there's better things to do than sit on a phone all day typing to people incessantly. I only have a few friends outside of my family that I talk to everyday. But since i talk to them on a daily basis, I don't feel the need to keep a conversation going on and on and on unless we're together in person (like you said). I find it draining and I don't like when people get mad just because I don't have my phone on me all the time when we just talked an hour ago. If it's an emergency, I would understand. But I feel like people are too reliant on technology and forget there's a world outside of a phone screen lol. "
6134,isfp,"I prefer writing communication versus verbal. I have been known to ignore a message if the person deserves it though - I am passive aggressive in those instances. 
What you can think of when your BFF is texting you, is that she's seeking something to connect you two, which ISFPs love. Maybe look at it from that perspective? "
6135,isfp,"I prefer texting over calling because of what you said, I can write out my response and refine it without being expected to immediately speak. I find it more difficult to talk on the phone because I can‚Äôt see their facial expressions, and if someone/something else near me makes a sound or moves, I get distracted and forget what we were talking about. I do call people on occasion, but that‚Äôs only if I need information right away.
I usually remember to text someone back rather than call them back, probably because texting is easier for me to do. Speaking of which, I told one of my friends that I would call him back the next day and it‚Äôs been 4 months now... üò¨
But yeah, I generally like texting better"
6136,isfp,"i prefer texting over calling, but i prefer to talk in person over texting. when it comes to texting though, i ignore messages a lot especially if i'm not in the mood to talk or answer which is a lot of the time :P 
but yeah i like texting because i can take as long as i want to think about how i want to respond 
oh and i don't really misread/misinterpret text messages that often! "
6137,isfp,"I normally like texting when there's a meaning to it, I hate small talk... but I have such a friend too. She's ESFJ.
She texts me things like ""Today I've been on the toilet three times already"", which is no problem for me, my reply will just be an emoticon if at all.. But more than often she also texts me before she sends an email or a text to her lover(s) and asks me ""is it okay to write it like this.."" or something like that. Or sending me pictures of her to tell her if she looks good and which one should be her next profile picture (my mother for example knows exactly who is texting me when she sees me rolling my eyes).
Lately I ignore these texts too because I told her more than once to decide on her own ......but she also annoys me when we meet face to face and spend too much time together because her need for constant affirmation is very exhausting.
But I also know what you mean with the feeling of having to reply straight away and I also have a problem with misinterpretation of texts.. sometimes I have days on which I don't reply to anyone if it doesn't seem important, I guess my friends are used to it by now.."
6138,isfp,"The Tl;Dr of my thoughts is Calling < Texting < Proper, human contact. I generally prefer calling as I feel more interesting and can keep a conversation going better, but setting aside the time to call feels like too much. Plus, I'm kinda paranoid about my privacy, so the thought of people being able to hear my conversations is pretty nerve-wracking. Still, neither beat being able to hang out with a friend, which I guess is a given"
6139,isfp,"The don't usually reach out to text someone unless I have a need, or something reminded me of them or I think they would find it funny etc. That being said I'm a terrible texter, and I worry sometimes that my tone comes off different than I intended when I text. Maybe it's an ISFP thing, maybe it's a human thing!"
6140,isfp,"Completely depends, if it's just talking to a friend, I prefer face to face the most, then texting, then calling. If it's something important, I'm fine with everything except for calling, I really hate calling."
6141,isfp,"Completely agree with you here. I‚Äôm happy I made this post because it‚Äôs really helped to clear some things in my head that were bothering me. This is my first time posting on any public forum ever haha! More often than not I keep all my thoughts inside and search the web for a post or something that I can relate to. I don‚Äôt know any other ISFPs in my life to talk to, so this has been real nice! 
The sense of urgency is what bothers me too. This past year I‚Äôve actually turned off the notification on my phone that displays the number of messages by the message icon. As I said, my best friend texts in spurts and seeing I have about 10+ unread messages whilst I‚Äôm busy at work etc really bugs me so I had to turn it off! It means I often don‚Äôt see her messages or I don‚Äôt reply for hours but she doesn‚Äôt seem to mind..."
6142,isfp,"I've been talking to this ISFP girl I'm interested in, and it's so frustrating. She takes literally 24 hours to respond every single time and it's one message, then I have to wait another 24 hours to get the next. Maybe she's just not interested in me, but this is pretty much a deal breaker for me..."
6143,isfp,"Totally with you with the ignoring messages! And you‚Äôre right about seeking to connect with me. It‚Äôs nice to know she thinks of me first to talk to. But sometimes it feels like she‚Äôs talking at me, rather than to me. She‚Äôll seem to be moaning and stressing about something one minute, and then laughing and gossipping about a colleague the next. I just find it hard to tell what she wants from my reply as she jumps from one subject to another too quickly. Often I‚Äôm still replying to the first text and she‚Äôs already talking about something else."
6144,isfp,"Ah reading this comment... I RELATE TO EVERY SINGLE THING! Even the toilet thing haha! She took the MBTI test and she was originally ESFJ but now she keeps getting ENFJ, but I still believe she is more ESFJ. She does all the things your friend does too - looking for that affirmation, which I can give to her in small doses but sometimes her need for it is too much for me to care about (does that sound harsh?) I feel myself caring about her looks less and less because she constantly talks about it. She recently got a new boyfriend and won‚Äôt stop telling me how much he says she‚Äôs beautiful etc... I have been ignoring these messages or I just wait until she‚Äôs onto the next topic talking about something else. I guess I just get frustrated cause her messages are so fleeting sometimes. It‚Äôs easier to talk to her face to face I guess cause I can understand from her tone what‚Äôs just random mumbo jumbo coming out etc... Maybe I should have made this post more about being best friends with an ESFJ, but the texting thing was bugging me for a long time. My friends are used to my sudden silence too, it‚Äôs quiet nice haha."
6145,isfp,"This is interesting. As I said, I don‚Äôt enjoy texting in general BUT I do enjoy texting my boyfriend and even more so when we first starting seeing each other, as the conversation was new and different. If she‚Äôs taking that long to reply then it might mean the convo isn‚Äôt interesting enough...? Maybe try and get into a face-to-face convo with her? "
6146,isfp,"Haha that doesn't sound harsh at all, it actually took me some time to tell her that it's too much for me, also because I'm her only friend she can talk to about everything because I'm the least judgemental of all her friends and we're friends since almost 10 years now.
I have another ESFJ friend and she's so much easier to handle, maybe it's just that she's more mature than the other one but I also thought about the toilet-texting one could be ENFJ.... just because she has this overly weird thoughts of what others could think of her, but to be honest, I'd need to read more about the Fe/Ni combination and compare it to aux Si to be sure.
But all in all I can't understand why the ISFPs natural partner should be an Fe dom. On the long term I can't give them the amount of affirmation they would need... but maybe males are different to females.. I don't know any ExFJ males...
Yeah maybe you should have, but I guess it's my fault, I digress too easily sorry :'D"
6147,isfp,"I believe she is ESFJ. I‚Äôm learning more and more what to disregard and what to pay attention too, it‚Äôs just effort ya know? I feel like I wanna give my full attention to her, as I would expect she would do for me, so when she texts me random stuff it kinda feels like a waste of my time...?"
6148,isfp,"Ah I see, well I think it‚Äôs more of the fact that she texts more friviously than I do so often I‚Äôm wondering why she is texting me such things or how does she expect me to reply? Stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already been to the toilet 3 times today‚Äù "
6149,isfp,"So, I'm an INTJ and I'm currently working with a girl who I'm very certain is an ISFP. Any thoughts on the viability of such a relationship? Looking at the functions, I was intrigued to see we share them all, but obviously the order matters since she's in many ways vastly different from me. It may be that I'm experiencing a purely physical attraction, but sometimes I feel like there is this super complicated and deep person under that happy go lucky ISFP exterior, it's just buried pretty deep and seems to rarely come out. Point being, in general, this type matchup, do you think it makes any sense?"
6150,isfp,"I feel like you're looking for an isfp perspective, but I'm sure you'll enjoy some NT analysis:
I'd like to start by saying that any type combination can work for anyone. It's just a matter of communicating effectively through different functions. That said, what are you drawn to in this isfp? There's definitely a lot of personality on the inside, but from what I've seen, it can't be put into words. You just have to ""understand"" it. There seems to be a playful, lighthearted charm on the outside that just takes in the world. Gently being present. There's also a serious and focused side to balance that out. Seeing that you're aware of the functions, you'll probably recognize this as Fi. This is the main course.
Here in the inner Fi world (through my observation), all the information from the day, week, etc. gets processed. Isfp's are generally way too hard on themselves in this inner world. Way too critical. On the outside, I kind of sense a ""mopey"" attitude sometimes. Something off. This is a regular cycle. The interesting thing is that since all that critical inner world stuff is happening, it'll rarely be expressed. That's a protected, sealed vault that if you even got into it, everything is written in a different language anyway. 
To answer your question, I'll have to pose another question. Would you be able to understand and accept those two sides? Te might compel you to try to ""fix"" something you think they're agonizing over, but the best thing I've seen is to be silently supportive as they work through whatever the hell happens in there. That means accepting that they'll go ""off the grid"" to reflect, analyze, and maybe do something creative. What the hell do I know? That's why I hang around this quiet sub (I know you're all watching silently!). Isfps are a puzzle, but I think they're secretly proud of that.
Sorry that got a little rambley. I've been feeling philosophical lately
Edit: I'm glad you all agree with my analysis! Thanks for coming out of the woodwork. I'll figure you complex people out..."
6151,isfp,"INTJ female married to ISFP husband for 2 years now.
¬†
Initial dating stages were the best. We were each others' bestie sweethearts. We were super sweet towards each other.
¬†
Initial marriage stages too were good, but I soon see a side of him that he never shown, which is his treatment of his family. Not evil nor mean, but a little impatient because he ""knows his family all too well,"" especially his younger brother.
¬†
On to when I got pregnant. He was super caring and sweet still.
¬†
After I gave birth, that's when things changed drastically. That is when I get to see the other side of him, what I always like to call, seeing his claws and devil's tail. Not that he was being cruel, but just not as sweet and caring as he once was. I could put it to him being traumatized by my labour (he was there the whole way, witnessing every moment) & his capacity to be unable to fully comprehend & deal with the trauma causes his change in demeanor.
¬†
Basically, now he is showing me his true colors. His sensitivity towards especially how and what I say, the INTJ way I have been saying it since Day 1 I know him. I have always been up front of my behavior and never hid my true self with him. Which is why I am pretty disappointed with seeing how he hid his true self until then.
¬†
Currently, I am trying to find ways, but apparently he is not interested to listen to me babbling about MBTI, and I know he wouldn't care about reading thru' articles even about his MBTI. 
¬†
Bottom line, yours could work if you know the difference sooner & find ways to overcome it.
¬†
While it was exciting for me too to see husband and I share the same functions but in different order, I do not see the similarities much practically. For my strong point is his demon, and my demon is his strong point. It just doesn't click the ying yang way that it is supposed to. In this matter, the same function different order just doesn't cut it like how commonsensicaly it is supposed to seem to be. You know, like his strength is supposed to cover my weakness and vice versa? It just dont seem to work that way. In fact, it can be frustrating when I am using my Ni for a dom while he was using his Ni when he was down and under. Double trouble when both of us are going thru the NI-FI loop at the same time.
¬†
Indeed, I can attest to this, especially in the beginning. ;)
¬†
From my own experience, I can attest to this. There is that super complicated and deep person under that happy go lucky ISFP exterior, and from my narrative above, my husband's interior came out when he was faced with trauma and distress.
¬†
Unsure, till now. Since we have a child together, it's just better to keep the marriage for our child's sake. The righteousness in me and the family-related values that is deeply ingrained in my husband is what keeps us still together. Just gotta try and improvise whatever I can to try and make it work again, and as per a valuable input I received from another Redditor, perhaps its the challenge of parenthood that gets us on each others' nerves.
¬†
¬†
PS: Thank you for allowing me to write this comment. It helps put things in better perspective, as I am always trying to find ways to make this marriage work. I know I sound like pointing all the blame on him, but I know I have my part of blame too, which is basically the blunt way that I point things factually out to him without tact and etc."
6152,isfp,"Great comment thank you, very NT put indeed! Helpful!
So I would agree that any type combination could theoretically work, individual variance within type is a factor and then there's context and circumstance, etc. 
But I think that some types might have an easier time of it than other, for example the best relationships I've had (romantic or otherwise) have been with Ni or Ne dominant types. That being such an integral part of our personality it can get hard when we feel like that part of us is not accepted or appreciated/understood.
Now regarding this ISFP and myself, it's as you say, hard to put into words. I've been physically attracted to her since I met her, but I don't regard that alone as a fullfilling enough requirement for any furthering of a relationship (i.e. there needs to be an intellectual/emotional component for me also).
During this summer (we've worked together for almost a year, last ~six months in the same shifts) we've gotten to know each other better and I fell quite harshly in love, which has only intensified that is until last week, when I got annoyed with her.
To explain, we have a lot of chemistry in terms of laughing and joking around constantly, banter aplenty, and we hang out often after work, having a few or several drinks. She's very Se driven, she seeks sensory experience like a starving person seeks food, and she's dragged me along on several escapades which I otherwise wouldn't have gone on. I am able to express some of my thoughts about Ni, Te or Fi matters, that is to say abstract theories I have, analysis of the world or what I'm feeling and why (I'm getting better with expressing my Fi thanks to therapy) and sometimes she listens but sometimes she doesn't and most of the time she shows absolutely no interest in picking up those conversational balls. Which are in fact my lifeblood.
To this day, even though my Ni-sense tingling indicates to me a well of material, I feel like I have no idea most of the time, what she feels/thinks about most anything. 
So a week ago I got fed up with this sort of one sided communication I felt like we were having and started ignoring her (politely, but noticably) at work. She did seem to notice it, but again I have no idea if it bothered her or not.
Then 2 days ago, I followed her on a drinking escapade downtown after our shift and she ended up revealing to me her fascination and interest in stars and the cosmos (something I definitely share), which blew me away. All this time, I've never known that about her and she seemed very hesitant even when she was sharing that. (when I asked her why she liked stars so much, she admitted she felt thrown off by that question, like she was surprised I was interested or something. She did explain and we had a pretty great night).
So now I feel caught in the ""love"" trap again. Curses... :P
I guess what's confusing me the most is I don't really know why I like her so much. She's attractive sure, but so are other people. She's fun and entertaining, but again so are other people. She does feel like a puzzle though, an enigma to solve, but that's just ending up frustrating me more than anything. Her forcefield, so to speak, makes it very hard for me to get a read on what she's feeling or thinking at any given time and I sort of crave that feedback. 
To answer your question, I don't know since my Te anxiously wants to make sense of the world. I can respect people wanting to sort through stuff on their own, in their head, because I do that constantly (probably not to as refined a degree as a dominant Fi like her, but my Fi is always buzzing in the background of my head), but just in terms of straight up communication and conversation I find very little reciprocation for my Ni from her, and I don't think she gets how important that is to me. I genuinely am interested in knowing what she thinks and feels about whatever, but either she doesn't care or she doesn't understand that about me.
(speaking of rambling, this turned out way longer than I intended, if you read through this I thank you, my Ni flow-state is rambly)"
6153,isfp,"First off, thank you for your comment.
Now, from my reply above:
""So I would agree that any type combination could theoretically work, individual variance within type is a factor and then there's context and circumstance, etc.
But I think that some types might have an easier time of it than other, for example the best relationships I've had (romantic or otherwise) have been with Ni or Ne dominant types. That being such an integral part of our personality it can get hard when we feel like that part of us is not accepted or appreciated/understood.""
So I agree. But do you in your relationship, overall or maybe at some point, etc, have any issues with the Ni vs Se compatability? By which I mean my (INTJ) burning need for abstract discussion and pondering vs her (ISFP) craving for sensory experience and pleasure.
She seems really motivated to like ""do activities"", while I really love to sit down with a person and have long form conversations.
Have you encountered this problem at all and if so, how did you get past it? (assuming you have)"
6154,isfp,"interesting and thoughtful answer, thank you.
It's been 2 months since I asked this question and things are still pretty much the same. (us being friends, me being confused and indecisive and her being her charming self). 
What has changed is we went through a period of getting on each others nerves alot, then we patched that up and we've been getting closer lately, she's actually been sharing some things that have been bothering her, about several area of her life, which I found refreshing and interesting.
I guess what I'm stumped at, is twofold, how do I determine what she thinks about me? (i.e. since she's friendly and charming to most people, I feel like I have no way of determining her feelings about me) And second, can I reconcile my need for abstract discussion (Ni) with her need for sensory experience (Se)?
So I ask you, first, how did this relationship come to be? How did it start, etc.
Second, was the Ni vs Se a problem for you two? Initially or eventually?
Ps: I'm sorry to hear of your troubles, I think the pressure and responsibility of child rearing can wreck a lot of things. From my research it seems like the old adage, it takes a village, has some roots in our evolutionary history (that is to say, children being raised by the tribe and village, in a hunter gatherer model of society, rather than all the weight falling on one or two people in our current civilizational stage). 
For the future, I tend to think therapy is always a positive step to take, individual as well as couples, dealing with one's issues, is the only way of resolving them methinks.
PSS: I thank you as much for the answer as you me for the opportunity to write your comment. Writing things out, as well as talking about them, always helps me to flesh out my thoughts."
6155,isfp,"That's how my Ni works, actually. It can be hard to bring it out because of that. Sometimes I just don't know what to say at any given time and it can become quite... awkward at times (with my INTJ friend). But I guess that's the source of the mystery. I just don't know how to handle Ni things, at all, despite having it running in my head constantly. "
6156,isfp,"Certain types clicking better with each other? No, I definitely agree with that. I think the most important thing is that one of our first two functions are supported well enough by someone, but I won't get into relationship theory here. 
It's interesting - I also started working with an isfp more often (we'd known each other for years already) and that's when I started getting drawn in. As an intp, my Ne can start to get more rambley and abstract. Unfortunately, I have to try not to let the conversation get too philosophical or theoretical. I'd love to have that happen, but she (and I'm assuming most isfp's) just don't enjoy it. It needs to be present, practical, and relevant, even though they're fantastic listeners. I just feel like if someone is going to listen to me patiently, I might as well not bore them. That said, you two might have a barrier to overcome as she tries to grasp your Ni concepts/visions. It's present and practical versus future-oriented and abstract.
On a side note, if she's giving time to you, that's a great sign. Ixxp's use time as currency (in general) so she's got something invested.
I'm sure she noticed you ignoring her. For being Sensors, they're pretty perceptive. The downside is being very conflict averse, so you've got to try to be gentle with problems or critcism. My best guess is that she put herself in your shoes and did what she would want to happen - give you space so that you can process your feelings. I've noticed that most people believe that others share their dominant function, so Fi absolutely hates potentially hurting feelings and loves putting itself in other people's shoes  (just like I need to analyze and understand or you need to conceptualize visions).
It's good that she shared something. As long as you're supportive and interested, you should get more. I've used this metaphor before, but getting to know an isfp is like drinking a gallon of milk with an eye dropper. You'll get little bits at a time, but then you turn around and realize how much milk is still in the jug. 
In conclusion, I'd say that you need to consider what you're giving up here, because there does need to be a sacrifice. You won't be getting that Ni stimulation here. I'm sure she'll listen intently to you, but this just isn't the type to conceptualize. They don't brainstorm or conceptualize. Not really because they can't, but it's not ""practical"". You've got to try to stay in the moment. That said, they're amazingly creative and have ""physical"" ideas; things you can see. 
You'll have to focus on what you'll learn from her: reading emotional motivations (fuck are they good at analyzing that), being present and pulling you out of your head (my brother is an intj and is so physically out of touch that he's always knocking my stuff over. Literally every time he comes over), and what looks good. That last one may not sound like much, but seriously, I'm always asking for fashion advice and getting it instantly.
Oh and if you try to talk to her about your Ni needs, be careful not to make her feel incompetent or inadequate. Don't forget that they're extremely self critical already. 
If you have any other isfp related questions I'm here to share. I've spent way too much time trying to figure my coworker out"
6157,isfp,"You're welcome! Glad you appreciate it! Hope this helps you out, brother :)
¬†
Good that these happened, as it is a good thing for a pair to always get to know each other better thru communication.
¬†
Ah, this. This is the same thing that makes me think, what is so special about me, since my husband always mentions that the chemistry on our first meet-up is the same way he treats other people (guess what I feel, bashed, because that first day chemistry is still so special to me even though it doesn‚Äôt seem so to him). Until now, I cannot tell what's so special about me that makes him want to spend his life with such a bitch like me (I can be very commanding and overbearing, especially when I want to reach a goal like wedding day or getting a house or saving money to do up our house). I have never hidden my true colours with him since day 1, but have only been more bitchy when the real pressures (getting married, getting house, getting baby, save money) starts to set in. So yes. Many times I question myself, what makes him want to be with me? I am not pretty, he has been with prettier women, I am not the typical gentle loving and caring women, he has been with gentler women. So yes, I still question myself why he chooses me. He is still charming to people out there.
¬†
Maybe, maybe not. It depends too on how she wants the reconciliation. If things doesn‚Äôt work, the best is each get their own ways to fulfil own Ni/Se needs, like having other friends to fulfil those needs with. 
¬†
For husband and me, some good days we get to do some Ni talk, but usually that‚Äôs not the case because it is not easy for me to convey to him why and how I come out with certain solutions and just wish he can intuitively know what I am trying to say, and thus, makes me feel drained when he demands the logic of how and why I come out with certain things. Furthermore, long discussions about things that don‚Äôt matter or doesn‚Äôt interest my husband will just bore him and tune him out. Thank god, other than that, my husband is a pretty logical person who will thwart me out of my Ni talk when I get too out-worldy.
¬†
While for Se, I do get easily get drained if I have to actively engage with people around me for long periods of time, especially during functions with my husband, and while I let my husband enjoy his surroundings, I lay back and just relax when I get drained out.
¬†
Our first meet-up, we had that chemistry (which was special to me but my husband keeps saying that's how he is to people). Maybe it was something about INTJs being attracted to ISFPs? I don't know, as not many facts for me to back this up aside from a few Reddit posts.
¬†
After that day, despite our chemistry, my husband was reluctant to pursue me due to a few reasons (one mainly being the fact that I broke up 6 months before we met and he was afraid that my ex might come and patch things up with me). I knew he was different from the guys I used to date, his aura was different, so I pursued him, I was the one who texted him first (thru our mutual friend). From there, things start to happen. But from the dating to being in a relationship process, it took time. Both of us sorted our baggage from our individual previous bad relationships together. He settled mine, I settled his.
¬†
After that, came a confession period, and I was the one who initiated it. I can't remember how it went, but I believe I asked him what is going on and where is this going, because I don't wanna waste time on something that is not worth the time (if I can remember correctly that was what I said). He too confessed, and I think from then on our love story blossomed to be a good year of sweet story with rough patches here and there.
¬†
After that good year was the small wedding and the rest is history.
¬†
Eventually. Our romance was a quick blossoming one, we went too fast, and crashed too fast. We didn‚Äôt really get to know each other‚Äôs differences and need enough. During that point of time, I didn‚Äôt know about MBTI. Only when our marriage sees a lot of rocky times, was the time I discovered MBTI. Truth be told, should I have know our MBTIs during our courtship days, I might not want to be with him seeing how different we are (SFP vs NTJ, is like 75% difference if you look just from that angle). But now gotta suck it up and get it going, for our little one.
¬†
Aside all that troubles we go thru, he is an awesome father to our child (ISFPs are soft hearted like that towards the old, young and vulnerable ones). That‚Äôs still the soft spot I have for him. I still wish he makes an effort to have more Ni talks with me, and I wouldn‚Äôt mind going out and have more Se activities with him. In fact, during our initial stages, I was the one who brings him to places that I have been before I known him, as I love to go around places and do new activities with him. It‚Äôs that milestone achievement for me and significance of it is strong for me (I believe him too), as I love that significance of the first time doing a new activity with my husband (now, the first times with our first born =D). Se with new experiences and things are awesome for me, just that too much Se with people drains me out.
¬†
Thanks for the input. I think therapy is good too.  =D
¬†
You‚Äôre welcome!

TELL ME ABOUT IT!"
6158,isfp,"I know I know.. ISFP here, my ex was an INTJ. It bugged me that he never made a move, I ended up having to make a move on him. We dated for 2 years. Don't live so much in your head, your life will pass you by before you make a decision on something that has no guarantee."
6159,isfp,"very interesting indeed. thank you for your feedback! plenty of material to digest methinks.
I'll have to really mull over this Ni-deficiancy thing, since I don't really know how to connect with people, aside from Ni. Perhaps that offers an opportunity to grow and learn, but as you said, we tend to assume people share our dominant function and so I have a hard time grasping the notion that someone doesn't want to wax poetically about random abstract theories and ideas. 
I don't really see the value in pure experience (Se) in and of itself, if it's not followed up with contemplation, analysis or an emotional response. In some sense I guess we're all a little stuck in our wiring. 
Hmm.. Thanks again, I'll have to think on this."
6160,isfp,"Thanks so much for your reply. From my research and from answers such as yours I'm always getting to this same point of Ni vs Se and that divide. I've gotten very mixed answers, INTJs and ISFPs who are happily married for years and also stories of broken relationships, etc. (which is to be expected from any type match up as well, I'm sure)
However we're of course all a little stuck in our frame of being and our own perspectives and so I found it interesting to read this ""I rarely enjoy abstract discussion, or deep discussion of any sort really.""
To me that just doesn't make any sense... :P And that's what I'm wrestling with, in my particular circumstance, how much of my Ni can I suppress and still be happy and is it worth it, for this particular ISFP... 
As you say though, communication is key, for any relationship I'm sure, but especially when we have such a different lens we view life through. 
Thank you for this feedback, I've got a lot to think over methinks. "
6161,isfp,"my biggest dream, in any interaction with anyone, is for them to make the move. I'm regularly surprised that someone likes me or is interested in me or whatever, (romantically as well as otherwise). no doubt there's some self-esteem issues there, but also, I'm just not that good at reading people, I rarely know what people think of me, unless they share it with me very directly.
Regarding this ISFP, I really don't want to mess up our relationship as friends and coworkers though, so that also makes me hold back. I feel like a blind man, waving his hands in front of him, potentially misinterpreting and misunderstanding where we stand. She might just as well think of me as a friend or a potential romantic partner and I would never know. Uncertainty is fucking poison goddamn it!!!
anyway, I suppose you're right, but pray tell, how would you show such interest? How did you with that INTJ and how do you, in general?"
6162,isfp,"Don't think I have a number for it, but I'd guess pretty far. I roughly say that I would prefer a 70% of alone time to 30% of any kind of social interaction, but obviously that also depends on the day and circumstance (basically a bullshit number).
What contributes to it is social anxiety though, which I have in spades, though I've gotten considerably better at managing it over the years. I do actually have a pretty active social life (for me) at the moment, with friends, coworkers and fellow students. 
I would prefer to have that group smaller though, with deeper relationships, instead of the army of aquintances I have to deal with."
6163,isfp,"If I don't share the interest or want to keep them away, I do ignore or avoid. But people I am interested in, in whatever way, I show a lot of interest and actively try and engage them in conversation and show genuine interest in what their thinking about."
6164,isfp,"and yet your actions say otherwise. Remember, ISFPs take things personally. She can easily assume that this means she was too strong and backed off on you or feels friendzoned."

6166,isfp,"i've been mistyping as istp but barely on the t and i keep trying to answer the test questions more honestly/accurately and looking stuff up if i don't understand.. and bam, it's starting to make sense why i do not like fixing things and am not good with my hands. also i feel like when i am around my friends i am more outgoing and friendly than an istp(although may be stereotyping) and i've heard stuff like that is the least istp thing i've ever heard and stuff but online. still only f by 3% but still. makes sense.
sooo... yeah just thought you ALL wanted to know... so thats why i posted.. here.. on this isfp board.. yup does my humor resonate or are you just not on the same level of ogoj(original gangster orange juice) as me. my rap name is le pimp, i AM.. a lyrical genius"
6167,isfp,"I just discovered this subreddit today and that I'm an ISFP couple of days ago lol. And I find it really, really interesting that there are other people like me (hopefully that makes sense).
I am just curious of all of your different backgrounds!
I'll go first. 
Born in LA to a Korean family. Raised in Ontario, Canada and in Atlanta Georgia. 19 years old male who is currently leaving a commerce program at a good university in hope of pursuing a music career. 
Academics were never hard for me but I could never find the motivation to do anything. Right now I have a 5 page essay due last Sunday and I am choosing to write this loll. I listen to almost every kinds of music ranging from choral, alt. rock, reggae, folk, instrumentals, to jazz. I find that I think on a broader level than most around me, which may come off as cocky, although I'm a pretty humble guy. I could write more but its basically all of the typical stuff that we read on the personality sites haha
I'm excited to hear all of your responses haha"
6168,isfp,"Born in Puerto Rico but raised entirely in Ohio, USA. I'm almost eighteen and headed to College in a few months with the intention to major in Psychology. I really enjoy the subject and have always been decent at interpreting body language.
Like you, I've never found academics to be especially difficult, but I never tried to take anything too challenging. AP Psychology/Neuroscience is the only ""high level"" class that I've ever willingly taken. I never cared much for grades. I hate having to play ""the game"" that is school. I find listening to lectures fascinating (especially in say, Physics) but I hate taking Quizzes and Tests. I simply don't have the motivation to do things that don't interest me. I actually have Physics homework to do right now...
Like you, I listen to just about anything. I've had several, several people tell me that they ""listen to anything"" only to find out that they really don't. I haven't met anyone with the same expansive taste in music as me (except maybe some of you guys? IDK). It's one of the few things that I actually take pride in. Maybe I shouldn't, I don't know.
I like to draw occasionally, but I've never been very good at it. I'm better than many of my friends, but not good enough for it to be worth sharing with the internet. Same with writing. I definitely inherited the ISFP's tendency to underestimate himself. That's something I've been trying to get over. I used to have a pretty bad inferiority complex a few years ago but I'm finally over it.
I spend countless hours on the internet. I love movies, anime, video games, and anything else that will satisfy my ""aesthetic needs"" and give me a good story. 
So yeah, I guess that's me in a nutshell! I really like this little sub we have. I want to frequent it more than I do, but I never have anything to post. Oh, and I'm always open to finding new music. You should give this song a listen and tell me what you think! I think it'd be cool if us ISFP's traded songs every once in a while. Since this sub is so small it wouldn't be that hard to get a feel for what other users are into."
6169,isfp,"Born in the states, moved around the world a lot, but spent a lot of my life in Ohio I suppose.  I did alright in highschool, I guess.  I took all the classes the over-achievers took which made things hell.  I think I'm pretty dumb but people assume I'm smart for whatever reason.  Going to graduate college soon from a pretty good animation program but really nervous about my job prospects.
I'm writing this as I'm avoiding working on my thesis ahahaha..."
6170,isfp,"Hah. The irony is palpable. :P But seriously, welcome aboard. You're on a path of self discovery that can bring about beautiful insights if you look at it the right way."
6171,isfp,"I am a high school freshman. I am 15, black, 5'1"" and a Scorpio.
I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. I plan to attend college in Michigan to become a Middle/High School English or Social Studies teacher.
High school is okay at the moment. I have two A's (Latin and PE), one B (World Geography), two C's (Math and English) and a D in Physics. I'm trying really hard to bring up my Physics grade, honest! And I already picked out my classes for next year! Spanish, AP European History, Level 2 English Honors, Chemistry (mandatory), Study Hall (also mandatory), PE (also mandatory) and Creative Writing as an elective.
I have until May to get my act together. It might not look like it, but I'm working on it! I'm passing quizzes in English and Math, but I need the teachers to hand out another test to redeem myself! As for Physics, I have a lot of work to do. I know I can do well. I'm going to try harder if I already haven't!"
6172,isfp,"Man the similarities between ISFPs are astounding. 
I sat in my friend's Political Science class and at the time it seemed like the most interesting class ever... until I switched in. I had to do group assignments, discussions, essays, etc. and it was hell on earth. 
The more and more I get to know people, I learn how different we all really are. What is amazing to us may seem stupid to someone else. So I stopped being ""prideful"" of my taste in music lol.
I usually go on drawing binges (3-4 days of constant drawing), then I stop for months at a time.
Oh man. TV shows, movies, anime, manga, AskReddit are all addictions of mine. Like you, I need a good story. I can't play video games because I struggle with the mediocre stories!
I'm liking it, their sound is pretty clean. Check this out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdQXleZ8ow"
6173,isfp,"ISFP's tend to underestimate their own abilities. Learn to accept yourself. You might not be super smart, but you made it to Grad school. That means you have at least average intelligence or above!
And animation program? Like, 2D cartoon-esque or 3D Disney/Pixar-esque?
Edit: Nice to see a fellow 'Ohian'!"
6174,isfp,"You sound like a Zelda and Kingdom Hearts fan to me :)
Also, is there an anime that you're currently in the middle of? If so, what is it and why do you like it? On that note, what's your favorite anime and why?"
6175,isfp,"Physics is the bane of my existence. It's not that it's uninteresting, it's just the all of the assignments are awful and I never learn anything unless its coming out of the teacher's mouth for some reason. I'm having a rough time with it myself. My only goal this semester was to pass it. I managed to pass with a 79% and felt super proud of myself. Good luck!"
6176,isfp,"Male or female?
I know what you mean about faces. If I'm ever drawing a face or looking at a drawing of a face, there's something about them that's just captivating. I can stare for the longest time. 
(Have you seen Frozen yet? I could watch gifs of Elsa and Anna's facial expressions all day.)"
6177,isfp,"Nah you seem like an interesting person (us ISFP's are proven to be overly critical of ourselves)!
I find that I am able to tell a person's personality just by looking at their faces. Not even kidding lol. I made my friends show me their friend's Facebook profile pictures (around 50 random) and about 95% the time I was able to discern people's personalities, what social social circles they were in, their intelligence, etc. I was wondering if it's the same case for you? I probably sound crazy ahah"
6178,isfp,"I was lucky enough to find a Highschool that is perfect for me. It creates a good learning environment that prioritizes becoming an intellectually competent guy with morals over getting good grades. It also doesn't break easily into cliques, which is always nice. People tend to be disciplined, bullying is almost a non-issue, and you aren't afraid to strike up a good conversation with people because odds are they're even smarter than you are. I almost don't want to leave."
6179,isfp,"Hi new here
Do any of you have adhd pi
and if so, do meds have an effect on you?
I was wondering because isfp traits and struggles
resembles that of adhd.
I started medication 3 months ago, but don't feel much different, so maybe it just could be my personality. 
Thanks for reading and hope you respond :)"
6180,isfp,"i have ADHD and am an isfp. i started meds at 13. they did help but they didn't fix everything. i was still a bit forgetful on them and (like anyone) struggled to pay attention to things i wasn't interested in, but my executive function hugely improved and i had a stronger desire to stay on task and get things done, and see the larger picture of situations and tasks rather than hyperfocusing on the details.
if your meds aren't working for you, read more about how they should be taken for maximum effect. for example, my meds right now must be taken on an empty stomach and i have found they do not work at all if i take them after a meal. you can also ask your psychiatrist to try a different brand or a higher dose."
6181,isfp,I was just recently thinking about how ISFP is the quintessential ADHD type. It just feels like im reading a description of the daily impulsiveness and creativity minus the struggles LMAO. I honestly don't know if meds have an effect on my personality type because I had fixed alot of self-problems that allowed me to actually be myself while on meds and I haven't taken a solid break ever so I'm not sure but I feel like things would be the same.
6182,isfp,"Interesting that I've come across this! I was just having this conversation with my ISFP husband, maybe a little over three weeks ago? 
He was diagnosed with ADD in his teens and I brought up to him that the more I study the cognitive functions, the more I think that this is just the way he is, no ADD diagnosis necessary. 
So funny that I was thinking this thing and here it is. "
6183,isfp,"unfortunately, i do still have thoughts bouncing around all the time. it gets worse if i'm in a situation where i'm anxious which makes me think it's partially anxety and not ADHD itself.
i have tried various meditation practices and some have helped, some have not. i have found it more helpful to make sure i am eating regularly and drink something caffienated than anything else. caffiene seems to make non-ADHD people more hyperactive but i have found it has the opposite effect on me and i also use it to sleep.
but yeah, the medication makes it easier for me to ignore my thoughts, as if the real world around me becomes more substantial and important and the primary arbiter of how i make decisions. i feel like i have more physical energy on the meds whereas normally it's all mental."
6184,isfp,"Mm-hm, I can certainly see this being the case as well. It's really fascinating stuff. 
I don't really understand how my husband's brain works. What makes sense to him is practically a foreign language to me and vice versa. 
He's described having ADD as feeling like his brain is constantly on fire but he wouldn't change any of it, even though he has struggles. 
What have you found helps you in the daily grind? I mean, all the endless, stuff, we have to constantly take care of: bills, licences, deadlines, etc."
6185,isfp,"Well, I'm 19 and still live with my parents (here in belgium) so bills and licenses aren't a problem yet, but when I do get paperwork there is a big chance it will lay on my desk for a long time or I just completely lose it. That's why I try to handle it right away while it is still in front of me. 
As for deadlines, they are always a 50 / 50, it depends a lot on my mood and how much it is on my mind."
6186,isfp,"Haha, my husband's got twenty years on you but I remember him having these issues you mention; he still does and is trying to figure it out. 
If you can, I'd suggest doing your best to perfect the systems that will help you keep everything running smoothly because it's wild out here when you're completely on your own. I'm pretty sure all these forms and paperwork and so on are trying to kill us, heh."
6187,isfp,"For me it's: Taking long walks at twilight, my cat in his red velvet bow tie collar, watching a horse run, eggs Benedict, waking up early and realizing I can sleep in that day, and anything to do with peaky blinders. "
6188,isfp,"Tons of things. Whenever I realize my mind is wandering or I'm in a bad mood, I tell myself.. hey. Look around you. There's some pretty great things. It can be anything from the color of this thing is so pretty to wow I'm alive and breathing and all these things work together to do that and that's super cool.
Idk, I always try to find something."
6189,isfp,Whenever I'm driving near an airport and an airplane flies overhead I get ridiculously happy. I've seen it happen hundreds of times but every time it happens I feel like a little kid that's seeing it for the first time ever. 
6190,isfp,SO MANY THINGS! I love the first breath of air I get in the morning after walking outside. The smell of rain. Kneading bread dough. Cleaning a small area and making a noticeable difference. Seeing my boyfriend really happy makes me really happy. The fact that I am young and able to really enjoy using my body for physical exercise and martial arts training. The fact that I bounce back from injuries overnight (for now). Sitting on my soft couch in silence after a long day. Watching the sun rise. Extra morning cuddles when we don't have anything to do right away. Cooking or baking something I am proud of. Learning anything new. Being welcomed by friends when I arrive at an event. Sitting in a warm shower. The first swim of the summer. I can go on and on! That was fun. This made me happy :)
6191,isfp,"Walking barefoot in grass (the texture and temp is calming), watching my puppies, especially my springer spaniel Gimli. He's special. Browsing deviant art, guinea pigs (I love those little creatures), a good book, being outside, fishing, road trip, music of all kinds, a relatively clean house but not so clean it's stiff feeling I need a little clutter something cozy, a nap, Reese's peanut butter cups, certain smells like Vanilla or paint or a home depot / Menards/ wood shop type smell (Because projects!).. Basically anything that appeases the senses I guess. "
6192,isfp,"I once woke up with hang over near camp fire in the morning. I opened a cold beer and walked to the small hill. The sun was chriping and birds were shining. I pulled down my pants, took a sip from a beer can and felt the wind's chill touch on my buttcheeks it was something I havent ever felt before. I looked down from the hill to the vast yellow field and peed for good 2 minutes.
Those 2 minutes changed me. Small things ..."
6193,isfp,"After a snowstorm when the sun comes out but the snow is still everywhere and it's so bright and calm.
When I see someone smile super genuinely. 
When my cat curls up next to me while I'm watching a movie or reading. 
Drinking wine with my best friends on my cozy balcony. "
6194,isfp,"Hot showers. Walking outside on my own in the morning, when the air is cool and fresh and the sun is warm, especially during sunrise. Cold showers. Flat bed sheets. Being able to make my cat purr.  Listening to pouring rain outside while I'm safe and cozy in my bed. "
6195,isfp,"I don't think this is too common but - motorcycle rides. Whenever I go back to Bangkok, I have to take a motorcycle ride. I like it especially when it's at night and I know it's going to be a long ride. Maybe not for more than two hours, because butt spacing and comfortability is still a thing (unfortunately.) There's just so many cool things to look at and the scenery and buildings at night look very spooky. Feels urban. Oh and because my father has been driving motorbikes for 20+ years, he can zoom really, really fast while still being safe and I can feel the cold air actually hit my face. That's amazing. And I can see all the lights and cars and move past by and stuff. Other than that, I like laying on my back especially if I worked really hard on something and petting stray cats I find. Everyone else seems to be talking about snow or staying in while snowing. The only real experience I've had with it was when I was 7, but I've always wanted to experience snow. It sounds and looks so nice."
6196,isfp,"The stars. I can't wait until I have a chance to gef out of the city and see the real night sky. Besides that, there was this one night, between my friend and I, where we were chatting on skype until, like, something-am and we were both drawing on our ends and he had some good music and it was all peaceful and stuff... Oh, and also, when driving, looking at the passing scenery. I love pretty clouds too. Being cuddled up in a blanket when outside the blanket is cold, my cat meowing, large waters (lakes, rivers, seas and the like). Naps, naps are good too. Wow, that's a lot."
6197,isfp,It's somehow even better when it's waking up from a nap. One day back in high school I went home during my off time and fell asleep in my desk chair. When I woke up like 3 hours later the sun was shining through my window perfectly and it was possibly the best and most relaxed I've ever felt. 
6198,isfp,"I use it a lot.  I suck.  It helps me feel at ease with my shortcomings and insecurities.. by sacrificing myself to bring a little bit of laughter to others.  Also it allows me to maintain a state of comfortably low self esteem, wherein I never disappoint myself because I don't intend on making anything of myself.  But at the same time it's not like I'm hurting anyone or bringing anyone else down in the process, so it's all good."
6199,isfp,I do it but I hate myself. I think it‚Äôs easier to do it to myself then to have others do it to me first. I think it can be a sign of deeper issues. For example I was abused as a child by my family and bullied growing up. 
6200,isfp,"agreed. i do it to a certain level but i definitely know when to stop & it's purely me just joking around. when others do it i feel like sometimes it gets out of hand where it seems like they're actually half serious and i just don't like it. when people take it too far it honestly sorta makes me feel uncomfortable...
edit: wording "
6201,isfp,"I have a couple, definitely not everyones cup of tea. 
6lack ft j. cole- pretty little fears 
joji- slow dancing in the dark 
Night lovell- dark light  "
6202,isfp,"Eleven - Last Dinosaurs
The entire album is still amazing and choosing one song was difficult since i wanted to choose like 3 from it."
